       " 'content': ['A Massachusetts investment firm behind a successful shareholder proposal urging Kroger to disclose pay gaps for women and minorities is pushing for a similar measure at Procter & Gamble’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.In a non-binding measure during the consumer product giant’s online-only annual meeting, Arjuna Capital wants the maker of Tide laundry detergent to begin reporting the median differences in pay between non-minority males and females.It also wants Cincinnati-based P&G to report the pay gap between white men and minority male and female workers. Touting an “enlightened” approach to investing, the Manchester-by-the-Sea-based firm describes its philosophy as seeking “financial returns while promoting a more vibrant economy, a healthier environment, and a more just society.”“Pay inequities persist across race and gender and pose substantial risks to companies and society at large,” the investment firm said in support of the measure in P&G’s proxy statement. “Actively managing pay equity is… linked to superior stock performance and return on equity.”In its proxy, P&G pledged it would be “happy” to disclose gender and race pay gaps – on an adjusted basis only (Arjuna wants the company to report both adjusted and unadjusted). Unadjusted pay gaps would simply calculate a median of white male pay to women or minorities. Adjusted pay gaps remove factors such as “job level, performance, job-related skills and experience,” to more “accurately reflect whether employees are being equitably paid.”On an adjusted basis, P&G admitted to the slightest of pay gaps:Given the disclosure, P&G said Arjuna’s measure was “unnecessary,” and added reporting more data could “distract from our long-term efforts, unhelpfully narrow internal and external focus on discrete metrics, and misalign our reporting and strategy.”More:Procter & Gamble recalls 8.2 million laundry pods including Tide, Gain, Ace and Ariel detergentsThe pay equity measure is the only shareholder proposal listed on this year’s proxy besides routine votes on board members, appointing its audit firm and an advisory measure on executive compensation. Last year, the company voted on several shareholder proposals and CEO Jon Moellerfaced an environmental protest near his suburban Cincinnati home in Covington, Kentucky.Last year, Kroger shareholders approved the non-binding pay gap measure and the grocery giant has since pledged to begin disclosing both adjusted and unadjusted figures in its annual ESG (environmental, social and governing) report, starting in 2025.Earlier this year, P&G disclosed Moeller was the highest-paid local Fortune 500 head, making $23 million in its latest fiscal year ended June 30. Moeller’s pay ratio to P&G’s median worker (who earns almost $70,000 a year) is 329 to 1, the second-highest among the local major public companies behind Kroger. The proxy also lists pay figures for its top five executives, three of whom are not white males:·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Shailesh Jejurikar, the company’s chief operating officer (and a top future CEO candidate), made $9.7 million·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Alexandra Keith, the CEO of the company’s beauty business, made $6.8 million·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Fatima Francisco, the company’s CEO of baby, feminine and family care businesses, made $6.6 millionWith annual sales of $84 billion, P&G is one of the largest consumer products companies in the world and employs 108,000 workers, including 30,000 in the U.S. (with 10,000 in Greater Cincinnati). In the U.S., the company owns and operates 24 factories in 18 states. Overseas, it also owns and operates 78 plants in 33 countries.Besides Tide, P&G also manufactures such medicine cabinet staples as Pampers diapers, Gillette razors, Crest toothpaste, Pantene shampoo, Vicks cough drops and many others.P&G will webcast its shareholder meeting virtually via a live audio webcast on Tuesday at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time.LINK: www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/PG2024For the latest on P&G,\\xa0Kroger, Fifth Third Bank and\\xa0Cincinnati business, follow\\xa0@alexcoolidge\\xa0on Twitter.',\n",
       "  \"This month, the\\xa0U.S. Census Bureau\\xa0published a bombshell finding: The gender\\xa0wage\\xa0gap\\xa0just got wider for the first time in two decades ‒ with women now earning just 83 cents to a man’s dollar.\\xa0That’s maddening. But, for moms at least, it’s hardly surprising. It’s next to impossible to balance work and family in this country ‒ and as this new data shows, women are\\xa0taking the hit. As the cost of child care\\xa0continues to soar, women will just keep falling further behind.\\xa0On paper, there’s no reason to believe that women should be earning less than men. Girls are more likely to\\xa0graduate from high school\\xa0and more likely to\\xa0hold a bachelor’s degree.More women than men go to\\xa0law school\\xa0and\\xa0medical school, and women’s enrollment in\\xa0MBA programs\\xa0has reached record highs.In fact, women do earn nearly as much as men ‒ at least early in their careers. On average, women in their late 20s and early 30s are much closer to parity,\\xa0taking home at least 90 cents\\xa0on the dollar compared with the guys sitting next to them at graduation or new hire orientation.\\xa0Then, when women hit their mid-30s, something changes. The pay\\xa0gap\\xa0gets wider. It’s no coincidence that that’s precisely when women are most likely to be raising kids. All of a sudden, women are forced to make very hard choices to manage the demands of work and family.\\xa0As the founder of\\xa0Moms First, I’ve heard versions of this story from more women than I can count. Maybe mom drops down to part-time so she can make it to school pickup. Or maybe she switches to a new job that pays less but offers more flexible hours. Or maybe she drops out of the workforce entirely, because the cost of day care would have outpaced her salary anyway.\\xa0Make no mistake, we are talking about\\xa0moms\\xa0here. When women are paid less than men anyway (and, in the case of\\xa0Black and Hispanic women,\\xa0way less), deprioritizing their careers can feel like the only logical decision, even if it isn’t what they wanted.This creates a vicious cycle, where pay inequity begets more pay inequity ‒ and women are systematically excluded from economic opportunities.Opinion:Mothers cannot work without child care, so why aren't more companies helping?At the same time, while women experience a\\xa0motherhood penalty, men experience a\\xa0fatherhood premium ‒ working more hours and reaping bigger rewards than those without kids.As Nobel laureate\\xa0Claudia Goldin\\xa0put it, when describing her pioneering research on the pay\\xa0gap, “Women often step back, and the men in their lives step forward.”\\xa0Because here’s the thing: The “choice” to step back from the workforce isn’t much of a choice at all. If\\xa0grandma isn’t around to pitch in\\xa0and\\xa0child care costs more than rent, what other option do you have?The problem is only going to get worse from here.At home, moms are drowning ‒ with the U.S. surgeon general\\xa0issuing an advisory\\xa0cautioning against the present dangers to parents’ mental health and well-being. At work,\\xa0diversity, equity and inclusion programs\\xa0are under attack, denying women a fair shot to succeed.Opinion:Parenting is overwhelming. Here's how one mom learned to cope.After decades of\\xa0glacially slow\\xa0progress toward closing the pay\\xa0gap, we’ve already backslid. I hate to imagine how much further we could fall.\\xa0Especially when it’s so blindingly obvious what the solution is. If the lack of affordable and accessible child care is what’s holding women back, then we should make child care affordable and accessible.\\xa0To start, the business community can take action. When companies offer child care benefits, it’s not only a game changer for moms ‒ it’s a game changer for everyone. Offering these benefits pays for itself and generates a\\xa0positive return on investment. If any other investment gave you these kinds of returns, it would be a no-brainer.\\xa0In this all important election year, we also need to demand that our lawmakers take bold, decisive action on child care. Policies like\\xa0expanding the child tax credit, capping child care costs at 7% of working families’ income and paying caregivers a living\\xa0wage\\xa0are huge steps in the right direction. And it’s critical that our leaders continue to prioritize them.We should take every opportunity to\\xa0ask our candidates, up and down the ballot, how they plan to solve the child care crisis, and then we should hold them to their promises at the ballot box.\\xa0When I first began building the Moms First movement, a lot of people asked me: Why moms? Why not all parents? This is why.Yes, the child care crisis hurts all of us, dads included. But moms are paying the price, in the most literal sense. We have to change that ‒ not just for our kids and families, but also for ourselves and our future.Reshma Saujani is a leading activist, the founder and CEO of\\xa0Moms First and the founder of Girls Who Code.\",\n",
       "  'Corporate commitments to increase the number of women in the leadership pipeline are slipping amid mounting attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion.Employers surveyed by LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Co. are scaling back programs intended to advance women’s careers.The pullback is deepest for women of color, with companies reporting some of the sharpest declines in programs that boost their career prospects, the survey found.Bottom line: Too few women − especially women of color − are advancing into management positions. At the current rate of progress, it will take nearly 50 years for women to reach parity in corporate America, LeanIn and McKinsey said.Yet, at a moment when companies should be doubling down on efforts to create a more level playing field, they are pulling back.“For the first time in 10 years, we are seeing a drop in companies’ commitment to both gender and racial diversity,” Rachel Thomas, co-founder and CEO of LeanIn, said. “That’s, of course, concerning for us.”The number of employers who identified gender diversity as a high priority in the LeanIn survey fell to 78% this year from 87% in 2019.Support for racial diversity also declined, with 69% of employers saying it was a high priority, down from 77% five years ago.\\xa0LeanIn and McKinsey surveyed 280 companies with more than 10 million employees across the U.S. and Canada. The study is significant because it is the largest on the state of women in corporate America.Historic advantages have helped men dominate the business world, widening gaps in status, pay and wealth.\\xa0Women are outnumbered 5 to 1 in senior leadership, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the top executive officers at the nation’s 100 largest publicly traded companies. The gap for women of color was five times wider than the disparity for white women, the analysis found.While women today are more visible in corporate America, they are still far less likely than men to hold the top positions. What’s more, structural barriers to advancement remain, especially that initial “broken rung” that prevents more women from climbing the leadership ladder.Ten years ago, for every 100 men who got their first shot at a management position, only 82 women received the same opportunity. Today, just 81 women overall get the nod while women of color fare far worse: 54 Black women and 65 Latinas.LeanIn\\'s Thomas sees the recent strides of women as notable but fragile.“We are far from the representation we need for women,” she said. “We are far from the workplace delivering an experience for women that is truly fair, equitable and respectful.”Energized by last year\\'s Supreme Court ruling that ended race-conscious college admissions, activists like anti-affirmative action crusader Edward Blum and former Trump administration official Stephen Miller have taken aim at the private sector with a wave of legal challenges against companies, government agencies and nonprofits.Pressure campaigns from another activist, Robby Starbuck, recently forced major companies such as Harley-Davidson, Ford and Lowe’s to retreat from some of their DEI commitments.\\xa0DEI critics allege that women and people of color are being handed jobs and promotions at the expense of more qualified and deserving candidates. They also argue that any program that excludes white workers is just as illegal as a program that excludes Black workers.The \"anti-woke\" backlash has unnerved business leaders.“It’s hard to imagine that’s not having some impact on organizational commitment and investment. I do think that’s what we are seeing,” Thomas said. “When companies really have a deep focus on driving change, the numbers can really move and we can really see progress. And, at the same time, if they take their foot off the gas, the progress often drops away.”While DEI critics may be getting louder, many employers say they are staying the course, but they are scrutinizing investments to figure out what works and what doesn’t.LeanIn founder Sheryl Sandberg said the survey’s results are an urgent reminder that equality is good for business.“We know that more diverse teams do better. We know that companies that take advantage of the full labor force do better,” said Sandberg, the former COO of Facebook owner Meta. “This is an opportunity for us to make sure that commitment doesn’t wane because that commitment is so important.”',\n",

GOP groups want to help her win them.There is so much on the table. Climate change, an existential issue that will affect not only our lives but also those of our children and grandchildren, a woman’s right to decide what to do with her body, and much, much more.One candidate tells us we all have a place in America. The other tells us it is the other who is to blame for all our ills – and we Arab Americans are part of the “other.”\\xa0I have made my choice.

Here\\'s what they had to say about how couples\\xa0can get organized about who to invite, what percentage of them will come and how to politely limit guests.\\xa0The number of people should be based on your budget,\\xa0Jason Rhee, the Director and Owner of\\xa0Rheefined Company Weddings & Special Events in West Hollywood, says.\\xa0First, decide on a budget, let that budget lead you to a venue\\xa0and then settle on the appropriate number of attendee Rhee instructs. He has clients use a tiered system. People in the A tier receive the first batch of invites, then depending on the number of those guests who are not able to attend you can start bringing guests in from the lower tiers.\\xa0“Obviously the guests from the Bs and Cs should not know that they’re Bs and Cs\" he jokes, adding those are usually coworkers, acquaintances, or frenemies.\\xa0Ryan Hill,\\xa0who heads up Apotheosis Events in New York, also uses this system but refers to his as \"must haves\" and \"great to haves.\"As for the size of the total guest lis: “budget and venue really define the rules of engagement,” he explains.Do I need an open bar?:What to know if you plan to have a cash bar insteadThe rule of thumb is that 10 to 20% of guests invited will not attend, Rhee says\\xa0.\\xa0That\\xa0number varies depending on factors including the season, the location of the wedding and how far out you\\'re getting information to your guests, Rhee explains.\\xa0Hill confirms that about 80 to 85% of invitees will attend. That number shrunk a bit during the pandemic but has kicked back up since.\\xa0The size of a couple\\'s guest list depends principally on budget, however, Rhee says the average wedding he plans sees some 125 to 150 invites sent out.\\xa0“I love keeping guest counts at a number that creates an intimacy,” Rhee says.This varies from couple to couple. \"Really think about what’s important to you on that day,\" Rhee advises. For some pairs it\\'s having a larger guest list, for others it\\'s hosting a more intimate affair and spending the money instead on personalized details for attendees.\\xa0“There really is no wrong way to celebrate your love,” he says.\\xa0Hill says he tells couples to start with family first but is careful to clarify this doesn\\'t necessarily mean blood, it can mean chosen family. Think of it like a family tree, he explains\\xa0– you start with the base and then begin to trim back the branches.\\xa0Anything above 150 guests is considered a big wedding Hill says. Seventy-five to 100 guests is a medium affair and small would be 50 to 75 guests, he explains.\\xa0It can be difficult not to step on any toes when composing a guest list. Rhee says he always tells clients they can use him as a scapegoat. Blame the planner, he instructs.As an alternative, couples can also share the venue\\'s capacity or explain that they have decided on a specific number of guests per family.Hill says if you can\\'t invite them or allow them to have a plus one communicate the \"why\" behind it.\\xa0Many people say if you were in someone\\'s wedding or invited to it, they should have a \"must have\" for your nuptials. While he agrees that if you were in someone\\'s wedding they need to be invited to yours, if you were merely in attendance it\\'s not necessarily quid pro quo.\\xa0Deciding how to split up the guest list between partners can be a challenge.Typically, if more investment is coming from one side, that person should have leeway to invite more guests, he says.\\xa0Hill agrees.\\xa0“The side of the family that is hosting the wedding may get a few more invites,” he says, adding\\xa0“I think it’s always best to keep it as close to equal as possible.”Hill says if the person has a significant other –\\xa0emphasis on significant – then it is polite to give them a plus one. Otherwise, it\\'s okay to withhold an extra invite but make sure to communicate with them.\\xa0Give them a call, he advises, don\\'t text or write a note.The same\\xa0goes for allowing children, Rhee says. As clients get older and more of their friends have kids, he explains some couples decide their weddings will be adults-only affairs.\\xa0As for the timeline, it is usually a courtesy to send out a save the date eight to ten months in advance, then the real written invitation three to six months out.Moving in with your partner?:How to talk about splitting rent and other expensesUSA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day.

       "  'Sixteen years after making history, Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail Thursday for the 2024 presidential election with the hope of helping Vice President Kamala Harris do the same.The former president headlined a Harris campaign rally in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, where he leaned into how the contest is about character and values as much as policy differences. The event kicks off a series of rallies in battleground states for the VP and other down ballot candidates through November.\"At the end of the day, this election isn\\'t just about policies, it\\'s about values,\" Obama said at the rally, held in the Democratic stronghold of Pittsburgh.\"It\\'s about who we are and how we treat each other, and the example we want to set for our children, for their children. And it\\'s about character.\"Democrats are eager for Obama\\'s return given his immense popularity, which Harris allies believe will be necessary to awaken any remaining slumber with the base in addition to persuading the dwindling — yet crucial — margin of undecided voters.\"You have the orator-in-chief of this generation, politically. It cannot be ignored, his magnitude,\" said Michael Blake, a former Democratic National Committee vice chair who has worked with Obama since his 2008 campaign.\"In 2004 the speech that he gave inspired a nation, and he\\'s been still doing it 20 years later,\" Blake added. \"He is the closer, and it\\'s his time to close.\"Obama\\'s return comes at a time when Democrats and their allies are jittery as some polling shows cracks in the so-called blue wall states in Harris\\' race against Republican nominee Donald Trump. Other surveys show down-ballot races, particularly for Congress, either tightening or slipping away for Democrats, who already faced a difficult path to retain control of the Senate.Here are important takeaways from Thursday\\'s rally.Obama\\'s insertion into the 2024 campaign comes amid signs of cracks for Harris in Democrats\\' \"blue wall\" Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.Winning those three states — which Obama did in both his elections — remains the most viable path for Harris to defeat former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. A blue-wall sweep would mean Harris would not need any of the Sun Belt battleground states – Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada – as long as she wins each of the other states that President Joe Biden carried in 2020.\"This election is going to be tight,\" Obama said. \"Because there are a lot of Americans who are still struggling out there, still striving to make life better for themselves, for their families, for their kids. And let\\'s face it, as a country, we\\'ve been through a lot these last few years.\"More:\\'So goes Pennsylvania\\': Inside the Harris-Trump fight for top 2024 battlegroundBut, as detailed by the Wall Street Journal this week, Democrats have privately raised concerns that Harris is struggling to win a critical demographic in the Rust Belt battleground states: working-class voters who lack college degrees.Polls this week from Quinnipiac University found Harris ahead over Trump 49%-46% in Pennsylvania, but Trump leading in Michigan 50%-47% and in Wisconsin 48%-46%. Harris still leads in all three states in the FiveThirtyEight average of polls – but by less than 1 percentage point in each, a closer margin than Harris\\' polling leads a few weeks ago following her Sept. 10 debate with Trump.\"The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt,\" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.For both Harris and Trump, losing Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes – the most of any swing state – would severely hamper their paths to the needed 270 electoral votes to win the election.The presidential candidate who carried Pennsylvania has also won Michigan and Wisconsin in every election since 1988.Moments before Obama took the stage, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro told the audience \"politics is a team sport,\" before mentioning Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., who introduced Obama and is engaged in one of many closely watched Senate races this year.As much as Obama\\'s return to the trail is about this year\\'s presidential contest, which remains exceedingly close, it is also about him revving up excitement and focusing attention on down-ballot contests.Obama used Thursday\\'s rally to talk up candidates up and down the ballot, instructing people on how to \"choose a new generation\" to lead the country.Ahead of the event, Obama was featured in Senate campaign ads in Michigan, Maryland and Florida. He also plans to be part of other candidate-specific ads and robocalls.Democrats hold a 51-seat majority at the moment, and cannot afford to lose a single Senate race this fall because the GOP is already predicted to win the election to replace retiring Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia.None are more vulnerable than Democratic incumbent Jon Tester of Montana, who has been trailing Trump-endorsed\\xa0Republican businessman Tim Sheehy in every survey since August. A \\xa0New York Times and Siena College poll released this week shows Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL, leading Tester 52% to 44%.Losing the Senate would immediately hobble a Harris presidency should she prevail. Obama told the crowd how senators such as Casey, are the ones who will help her get things done.As much as Obama plans to do whatever he can to help Harris, he remains equally invested to help other Democratic contenders across the country, said Eric Schultz, an Obama senior advisor.\"His goals are to win the White House, keep the U.S. Senate, and take back the House of Representatives,\" Schultz said. \"Now that voting has begun, our focus is on persuading and mobilizing voters, especially in states with key races. Many of these races are likely to go down to the wire and nothing should be taken for granted.\"Much like the DNC speech in Chicago earlier this year, Obama continued to mock his White House successor as a self-absorbed candidate who cares little about average Americans and cannot be trusted with power.After commenting on how much the country has been through over the past four years, including a global pandemic, Obama expressed bewilderment that Trump gets support from anyone.\"What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania. I don\\'t understand that,\" he said. \"Because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.\"Obama used much of his speech Thursday to tear into Trump, whether for selling Bibles and other products while campaigning; trying to overturn the 2020 election after he lost; or appointing Supreme Court justices who knocked down abortion rights.At one point he compared the GOP nominee to former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, who was known for rambling speeches. Obama called out his successor for making several misleading statements for the federal response to\\xa0Hurricane Helene\\xa0and other controversial comments, such as calling political opponents \"vermin.\"\"The idea of intentionally trying to mislead people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments, and my question is when did that become OK?\" Obama said.The former president also brought up the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol amid chants to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence. Pence was inside the building at the time of the riot.\"If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?\" Obama said.\\xa0But he also joked that no one can imagine Trump changing a tire or a diaper when contrasting that with Harris\\' plans to help middle-class and working Americans tackle the cost of living in housing, child care and groceries.\"I remember changing diapers,\" Obama said. \"You think Donald Trump ever changed a diaper?\"A supporter in the crowd shouted: \"His own!\"Obama responded: \"I almost said that but I decided I shouldn\\'t say it.\"Before the rally got underway, Obama made a brief stop at a Harris campaign office in Pittsburgh, where in pointed remarks he called on Black male voters to get behind Harris.Although Harris holds a sizable lead over Trump with Black voters across gender lines, polling has shown the GOP nominee has made small inroads, particularly with young Black male voters.In a razor-close election, even a slight shift could make a major difference. The election increasingly is defined by the gender divide and debates about family.\"I\\'m going to go ahead and just say, speak some truths, if you don’t mind, because my understanding, based on reports I\\'m getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" Obama said.He added that it \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers,\" and that he wanted to speak directly to Black men.Experts and advocates have called attention to Trump\\'s comments questioning Harris\\' racial identity, calling it a way to raise doubt about the VP\\'s heritage among a segment of Black voters. Among that segment are those frustrated with the influx of migrants into major U.S. cities, who the GOP contender said are taking \"Black jobs.\"Obama said Black voters have one candidate in Harris, \"who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences.\"“And on the other side, you have someone who has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person,” he said. \"And you are thinking about sitting out?\"Obama said Black men are \"coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses,\" adding that, \"I’ve got a problem with that.\"“Because part of it makes me think — and I\\'m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren\\'t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you\\'re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"Obama framed the 2024 election as a race about two different ideas of \"freedom\" and competing \"values.\"\"For Donald Trump and his cronies, freedom means that the powerful can do whatever they please,\" Obama said, accusing Trump of wanting to fire workers for trying to organize and \"control what women can and can’t do with their bodies.\"Obama said Harris and Democrats \"have a broader idea of freedom\" – the freedom for Americans to care for their families if they work hard, to breathe clean air, for children to safely attend schools and for women to make their own decisions about their bodies.“I\\'ve always said there are good people of conscience on both sides of the abortion divide,” Obama said. “But if we believe in freedom, then we should at least agree that such a deeply personal decision should be made by the woman whose body is involved, and not by politicians.”Biden then ripped into Trump\\'s \"outright lies,\" calling the setting aside of values “one of the most disturbing aspects of this election season, about Trump\\'s rise in politics.” He said it used to be that Republicans and Democrats would argue about tax policy or foreign policy but “we didn\\'t have arguments about whether you should tell the truth or not.”“At the end of the day, this election isn\\'t just about policies, it\\'s about values,” Obama said. \"It\\'s about who we are and how we treat each other, and the example we want to set for our children, for their children. And it\\'s about character.\"',\n",
       "  'DURHAM, North Carolina – Nadeen Bir says she isn\\'t budging: Kamala Harris won’t get her vote in 2024 unless the Democratic presidential nominee commits to stop sending weapons to Israel.The 44-year-old Palestinian-American grew up in the United States and now lives in North Carolina, where she has otherwise been a reliable Democratic voter. Her father was forced to leave Jaffa as a child during the 1948 displacement and war that founded the modern nation of Israel, and her mother was pushed out years later in the 1967 war. She still has family in the West Bank, where she says they live with constant fear.“I feel conflicted because I know about splitting the vote and how that puts us at risk of having (Donald) Trump as president,” she said of the Republican nominee and former president.“But it’s not going to be our fault if Kamala loses,\" she added, saying she cannot morally support someone who hasn\\'t done more to stop the mass deaths in Gaza.Bir spoke with USA TODAY on a sunny September day in Durham, where around a dozen people with the group Mothers for Ceasefire gathered at a busy street corner during the morning commute. Two toddlers sat in a stroller, munching on Goldfish crackers and swinging their legs as the adults around them waved signs in support of Palestine. Many cars driving through the left-leaning city honked back in support, while one woman in athletic gear jogged by and yelled at the protesters: \"Get a life!\"Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.Kelly Harris Perin, another member of Mothers for Ceasefire, said she\\'s \"disappointed\" in Harris and doesn\\'t think the incumbent vice president has shown she\\'s willing to do more than President Joe Biden to stop the conflict.\"But I\\'m not a single-issue voter,\" Harris Perin said. Healthcare, abortion rights, education and gender-affirming care are all top priorities for her as well.\"We can\\'t afford another Trump presidency,\" she said. She plans to support and even volunteer for Harris while she keeps pushing for peace in Gaza. \"I hope that those things are not mutually exclusive.\"Bir and Harris Perin are among the voters in key swing states who voted “uncommitted” last March in the Democratic presidential primary, when Biden had no serious primary challenger in his bid for reelection, to register their frustration with the incumbent\\'s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Many of those voters are now determining how – or whether – they will vote in the presidential election.In North Carolina, more than 88,000 people voted uncommitted in the primary. Trump beat Biden by just under 75,000 votes in that state in 2020. Pollsters say it is likely to be even closer this year.In Michigan, which has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state in the country, more than 101,000 voters cast an uncommitted ballot in the Democratic primary. Biden beat Trump by around 154,000 votes there in 2020.\\xa0Winning at least one or both of these states is likely to be crucial for Harris or Trump to find a path to victory.The latest conflict in the Middle East began just over a year ago, when Hamas entered Israel and killed more than 1,200 people and took around 250 people hostage into Gaza, according to Israeli officials. Israel responded with air and ground raids that have killed more than 41,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, many of whom are women and children.Israel recently also launched airstrikes and a ground invasion into southern Lebanon against Hezbollah, which began firing missiles into Israel last year in support of Hamas. On Sunday, Biden announced the United States would be sending 100 troops to Israel to operate an advanced anti-missile system.The war has deepenedfissures within the Democratic Party and sparked a wave of campus protests in the lead up to the presidential election, which now features Harris instead of Biden and remains in a statistical dead heat. A tiny sliver of the electorate in select battleground states is likely to determine the outcome.When Biden dropped out of the race in July, some of those voters who were frustrated with his Israel policy appeared more open to supporting Harris, saying she struck a different tone on the conflict despite not substantively deviating from Biden on policy.But as November nears, thousands of people are deciding whether they think she has done enough to distinguish her position on the issue from that of her boss. Pro-Palestinian organizers and voting advocates say their support – or lack thereof – may still be able to swing the election.“It’s a bit of a muddled picture,” said former Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., who was an early advocate of the uncommitted movement in his state and who is now urging voters to support Harris. It’s been made even more complicated by the war\\'s expansion into Lebanon, as Michigan is home to one of the largest communities of Lebanese Americans in the U.S.“So that is problematic,” he said. “It’s a storm. We have to find our way through.”For almost a year,\\xa0the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has intensified firing of rockets into northern Israel. Tensions on that border have also increased since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.\\xa0U.S. officials are concerned that a ratcheting up of tensions between Hezbollah, a U.S. designated terror group, and Israel could lead to a broader regional conflict in the Middle East and have been trying to negotiate a cease-fire.\\xa0In the year since the Oct. 7 attack, Biden has largely stood by Israel in public even in the face of intense pressure from the left flank of his party, informed in part by his long history with the country.\\xa0He has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to limit civilian casualties, said he isn’t doing enough to bring home Israeli hostages and used strong language as he cajoled Netanyahu behind the scenes. In May, he paused the shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel.\\xa0But the destruction in Gaza and the Biden administration’s link to it drew backlash from young, progressive, Arab and Muslim voters who have made up important portions of the Democratic base in past elections. The “uncommitted” initiative sought to show Biden their electoral power during the primary to push for a change in policy, with limited success.Many of those voters were considering sitting out the general election too, said Our Revolution Executive Director Joseph Geervarghese, a political action committee that has helped urge progressive followers to vote uncommitted.But when Biden dropped out of the presidential race and threw his support behind Harris, the dynamic appeared to shift, said Geervarghese, whose organization was launched by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the wake of his unsuccessful 2016 presidential campaign to further progressive causes.Biden was clearly pro-Israel, he said. “I feel like Harris is signaling that she is a little more even-handed in how she analyzes” the issue.Harris has repeatedly said she supports Israel’s right to self-defense, and her campaign rebuffed efforts from activists protesting outside Chicago\\'s United Center to get a Palestinian American a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention.In her run for the White House, Harris has won over a cross section of foreign policy experts, including defense hawks like former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, as well as Sanders, who has publicly criticized the Biden administration\\'s handling of the war in Gaza, but has endorsed and is campaigning for Harris.\\xa0Like Bir, leaders in the uncommitted movement have pushed Harris to commit to stop sending arms to Israel. However, the campaign has said she will not consider an arms embargo. \"I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself,\" she said during the September presidential debate with Trump.But Harris also called for a cease-fire early this year, has supported a two-state solution, and has spoken of a Palestinian right to “dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.” These are positions that Biden said he shares as well.Among “our base, there’s probably a little bit more openness because of this signaling and because she’s not Biden,” Geervarghese said. “However, there has not been enough to give people confidence that she is going to fully pursue peace.”Because of that, he said, “there’s a real possibility” uncommitted voters could swing the election in key states like Michigan.James Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute and a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee, was one of the first national Democratic advocates to publicly stake out a plan to replace Biden following his disastrous debate performance in late June.He is bullish that Harris will have a different approach to the war than Biden has – not only because of her public statements, but because her campaign is putting resources into reaching out to both Arab and Muslim communities in a way that the Biden administration never did, he said.“The Biden administration was the most frustrating Democratic administration I’ve ever dealt with,” Zogby said. “I just don’t understand how they’ve behaved, not just on this, but their insular nature.”Arab Americans have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats for decades, according to the Arab American Institute.\\xa0But the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza has chipped away at that support and even driven some voters to Trump, according to a recent 500-person survey from the group. The poll found Arab American voters evenly split between the two presidential candidates and parties. Almost 20% identified as independent.“In our thirty years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,” the pollsters wrote in their analysis of the findings.That doesn’t appear to be lost on the Harris campaign. Harris met with Muslim and Arab American leaders in Michigan earlier this month, where she \"expressed her concern over the scale of suffering in Gaza,\" according to the campaign. A few days beforehand, her national security advisor met with Arab, Muslim and Palestinian leaders, and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz told Muslim advocates the war in Gaza “must end.”Harris \"will continue working to bring the war in Gaza to an end in a way where Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination,\" said Nasrina Bargzie, the Harris campaign\\'s director of Muslim and Arab American outreach.The Trump campaign, too, sees possibilities in the narrow opening among Muslim and Arab American voters by pitching peace in the Middle East, despite past policies that still scare some voters. The campaign has courted community leaders and voters and won the endorsement of the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, the first Muslim-majority city in the U.S. A recent Wall Street Journal poll found swing state voters preferred Trump over Harris in handling the Israel-Hamas war by 15 percentage points.In a statement to USA TODAY, Trump campaign senior advisor Brian Hughes alleged Biden and Harris have \"brought death, chaos and war\" to the Middle East. \"Only President Trump will restore peace and stability in the Middle East for all people and he will protect religious freedom for all Americans,\" he said.As president, Trump was supportive of Netanyahu\\'s government. On the campaign trail, he has said he would be Israel\\'s \"protector.\" He has also criticized Jewish Americans for supporting Democrats and suggested they would be to blame if he loses the election. His son-in-law and former adviser, Jared Kushner, has said Gaza\\'s \"waterfront property\" could be \"very valuable,\" and said Israel should \"move the people out and then clean it up.\"Many groups that have been vocal pro-Palestinian advocates have recently endorsed Harris, arguing that a Trump presidency would pose a greater danger to their cause, including the largest Muslim American voter advocacy group in the country, Emgage Action.\\xa0“If we are serious about advancing our anti-war goals and agenda and pushing for peace in the Middle East, including supporting Palestinian self-determination beyond just ending the war in Gaza, we just see no pathway for that to happen under a Trump presidency,” Emgage Action CEO Wa’el Alzayat told USA TODAY.The Uncommitted National Movement released a statement last month saying it could not endorse Harris, but said it opposes a Trump presidency and doesn’t recommend voting third party, as that could deliver a Trump victory. Spokespeople for the movement did not respond to multiple requests for an interview for this story.Zogby of the Arab American Institute and Alzayat of Emgage both said they are working to show Arab and Muslim voters that a vote for Harris is both strategic and ethical, given the damage a second Trump administration could do.“I’ve been telling people, we have a right to be angry, but we don’t have the luxury of being angry,” said Zogby. “For some groups to say we have to teach Democrats a lesson – that’s so irresponsible. It’s petulant and it’s dangerous.”It’s tough to determine exactly how many people are still making up their mind in the 2024 White House race. A USA TODAY/Suffolk poll from early September found around 7.5% of respondents said they were undecided or planned to vote third-party in the presidential election.\\xa0Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent candidate Cornel West are both running on a pro-Palestinian message and are pulling around 1 and 2 percent of voters respectively, according to the poll.Of those who were withholding their vote from Harris, 21% said they disagreed with her views and 11% cited the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Twenty-nine percent said they needed more information, signaling room for growth for the vice president.Alzayat said his group only has reliable data from before Harris became the Democratic candidate. At that time in mid-summer, around 30% of those polled said they would consider not voting or voting third party over the Biden administration\\'s handling of the crisis.Now, “a lot of people are considering voting for Harris when it comes down to it because they fully understand the options and the logic of their choices,” he said, according to the group’s unofficial internal polling. “But what they\\'re not comfortable with is expressing it publicly because of what\\'s happening.”Richard Czuba, founder of the Michigan-based polling firm Glengariff Group, said a recent survey of 600 voters he conducted in the state from Oct. 1-4 indicated the number of people who won\\'t vote for Harris over Gaza is small. Only around 3% of respondents said they planned to support Stein, West or another third-party or independent candidate. Almost 5% said they would support Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who will remain on the Michigan ballot despite dropping out of the 2024 race and throwing his support behind Trump.A recent poll of 600 North Carolina voters from the Wall Street Journal found 10% of voters said they planned to support Kennedy, 2% planned to support West, 1% said they\\'d support Stein and another 9% said they were undecided.It’s hard to measure the impact of Muslim and Arab American voters on the potential outcome, Czuba said. But another key part of the Democratic coalition – young voters – has clearly embraced Harris in the state.\\xa0As for whether the war in Gaza could cost Harris the election in Michigan, Czuba said, “we’re not seeing it in the numbers.\"Levin, the former Michigan Democratic congressman, said he\\'s worried the war in Gaza could still be a deciding factor in who wins the White House and that he\\'s going to be advocating for Palestinian, Lebanese, Arab and Muslim voter turnout for Harris \"right through 8 p.m. on Nov. 5th.\"\"And then on Nov. 6th, everybody can turn back around and keep pressuring for peace and for change.\"As the election approaches, Bir of Durham said she\\'s not changing her position.She said Harris only has herself to blame for failing to win uncommitted voters\\' support, and that she would have a better chance of winning if she embraced an arms embargo to Israel, as earlier polls from pro-Palestinian group the Institute for Middle Eastern Understanding Policy Project, the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and from the Arab American Institute might suggest.Other surveys indicate Americans are more split, such as the Associated Press-NORC\\'s poll showing an equal share of Americans say the U.S. is spending \"too much\" and \"the right amount\" to aid Israel, and a Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll that says 60% of Americans want the U.S. to continue military support until Israeli hostages are freed.Bir compared today\\'s pro-Palestinian activism – and the pushback they\\'re facing from mainstream Democrats – with the activists who opposed the Vietnam War in the 1960s and \\'70s. There\\'s \"a history of resistance that\\'s seen as a negative when it\\'s actually an important thing,\" she said.Still, Bir knows it\\'s a hard choice for many. Her own husband plans to vote for Harris, and her group, Mothers for Ceasefire, doesn\\'t plan to weigh in on the election. \"Everyone\\'s going to do their own thing, and we\\'re supportive,\" she said.She wishes there was a viable third option, and she\\'s tired of multiple election cycles with what she sees as two bad candidates. In the meantime, she said she\\'ll keep turning up on a street corner in Durham, pushing for change.',\n",

And we discuss how Georgia became a swing state.♦Hurricane Milton is now a monster category five with sustained winds of 165 miles an hour. Milton is barreling across the Gulf of Mexico bound for what could be a devastating landfall tomorrow along Florida's already storm-battered Western coast. The National Hurricane Center said in its 11 PM Eastern Time advisory last night that Milton poses an extremely serious threat to Florida after earlier warning that hurricane wind speeds had explosively intensified. Those speeds increased by 95 miles an hour in less than a day. And the storm rapidly intensified from a category two to a category five within hours yesterday. Milton is expected to weaken slightly before making landfall, but experts still expect a powerful storm. You can stay up on all the latest with USAToday.com.♦Meanwhile, the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene are still being felt in parts of the country. Towns across North Carolina are just beginning to recover and rebuild, and there's a new concern. Hospitals are urging the White House to help shore up supplies of IV bags after a North Carolina factory closed due to flood damage brought by Hurricane Helene. Several hospitals have implemented conservation plans and warned the public of potential disruptions since Baxter International temporarily closed a manufacturing site in Marion, North Carolina, about 35 miles from Asheville. The Marion factory supplied 60% of the nation's IV fluids to health facilities. The factory also ships dialysis solutions to dialysis centers.

I caught up with USA TODAY, Congress campaigns and democracy reporter, Karissa Waddick, to learn more about how the Peach state became a battleground. Karissa, thanks for hopping on today.Karissa Waddick:Thanks for having me. Happy to be here.Taylor Wilson:So Karissa, just starting here, what has Georgia really been politically in a historical light?Karissa Waddick:Prior to 2020, the last time Georgia had voted for a Democratic presidential candidate was in 1992 for President Bill Clinton. And then of course in 2020, the state voted for President Joe Biden, who's a Democrat. So it has gone back and forth and right now we are seeing that becoming a swing state, putting it in play for Democrats where over the last 30 years or so it has been a pretty Republican stronghold overall.Taylor Wilson:Yeah. So really, how is this changing? What are some of the factors here that you've seen?Karissa Waddick:Stacey Abrams, she is a big name in Georgia politics and in national politics. In the mid-2010s, Stacey Abrams founded an organization that was pivotal in registering Black voters and then also getting Black people in Georgia who were already registered to vote out to the polls. Stacey Abrams, with that work registered thousands of new voters ahead of her 2018 gubernatorial campaign.And although she lost that campaign, the margins were smaller than they had been before. And so between around 2012 and 2020 when President Joe Biden won in Georgia, we saw the margins slowly shrinking for Republicans. They were winning by less and less. And then when you got to Biden, he actually flipped it and won the state by a pretty large margin.And so registering those throughout Atlanta, Stacey Abrams efforts paid off, we also saw those efforts in other parts of Georgia. I spoke with a woman who leads the Gwinnett County Democrats and she said that they similarly were seeing new residents move into the state and they did that outreach effort with those new residents and got them to the polls.So it was an across-the-board effort from Democrats across the state reaching out and registering large swaths of people to even it out in Georgia.Taylor Wilson:Yeah. So on the Republican side, Karissa, how are they responding to this shift? What are they doing to center their efforts in the state?Karissa Waddick:So republicans are also doing outreach efforts. In Georgia, there's a large population of Latino and Asian Americans who are moving in from other states, from New York, California. All those other more liberal leaning places tend to be diverse and Republicans are seeing this just as much as Democrats are.And so they're reaching out to them trying to meet these communities where they are. I spoke with one Republican in Gwinnett County, which is north of Atlanta, and he said that they see hope for reaching Latino and Asian business owners specifically with their economic platform.Taylor Wilson:So you mentioned some of these counties both in and around Atlanta have been crucial to really what happens in Georgia and recent elections. What's the next county that's up for grabs that might really become a battleground county and even shift this thing further to the Democrats or change this equation even more?Karissa Waddick:So growth is spreading out from Atlanta. We've seen that over the last 10 years, right? You had growth move from Atlanta to the Atlanta suburbs and then now it's going to the exurbs. And one of the exurbs that I focused on was a place called Forsyth County. You might know of Forsyth because it was originally a sundown town.There were no Black people who lived in Forsyth for the majority of the 20th century. It was an extremely white county or was. But in recent years, it's seen a large influx of people and particularly South Asian. When I went there, I went to a Democratic event in Forsyth, and a majority of the people who are running for office were from out of state. They had moved in 2020 shortly after Joe Biden had won.They were looking for cheap housing prices in the greater Atlanta area, and that's where they went. And so a place like Forsyth, we're seeing the margins shift a little bit. Forsyth is still an incredibly Republican county, but the margins are slowly shrinking. And the democratic chair in Forsyth told me that there was 16,000 new voters in 2020 there, and that margin would've made the difference for Biden in that election.Taylor Wilson:Wow. All right. We'll be keeping an eye out there for what's next in Forsyth. As far as the election next month, Karissa, we're talking about Georgia here, four or five weeks out from election night, how big a player will Georgia be in this November election? And what's the expectation really for which way the state ultimately goes?Karissa Waddick:Georgia is a major swing state this election and the polling there is extremely close. Trump appears right now to have a slight edge in the polls, but most are within the margin of error, which essentially means that it could really go either way. The thing to look out for in Georgia is turnout.Turnout is really going to matter in these different regions. And how many people get out to vote, both Harris and Trump, they're competing against each other, but they're also competing against the couch. And if people don't go to the polls, that's going to matter in Georgia because it is such a close margin.Taylor Wilson:Great breakdown for us. Karissa Waddick covers Congress campaigns and democracy for USA TODAY. Thank you, Karissa.Karissa Waddick:Thanks so much.♦Taylor Wilson:In other news out of Georgia, the state Supreme Court has temporarily reinstated a six-week abortion ban across the state, effective one week after a state court overturned the law declaring it unconstitutional. The 2019 ban known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality or Life Act was reinstated at 5:00 PM yesterday, meaning abortion will once again be inaccessible for the vast majority of Georgia residents until the state Supreme Court issues a decision. The renewed battle over Georgia's abortion law is the latest development in a years-long court case that was filed shortly after the law took effect in 2022. It also comes a few weeks after reporting from ProPublica found that the law forced healthcare providers to delay medical care to pregnant patients and link the deaths of at least two women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candy Miller to the ban.♦Vice President Kamala Harris holds an edge among Latino voters in the critical battleground states of Arizona and Nevada. But former president Donald Trump is making inroads according to two exclusive new USA TODAY, Suffolk University polls. I spoke with editor Karen Weintraub to learn more. Hey there, Karen.Karen Weintraub:Hi.Taylor Wilson:So Karen, what did this new exclusive USA TODAY, Suffolk University polling find about Kamala Harris really losing some of this edge she's had with Latino voters in the key swing states of Arizona and Nevada?Karen Weintraub:It's not that Harris is losing, but she's losing a little bit of ground. So she's still 57 to 38 in Arizona and 56 to 40 in Nevada. There is a gender gap. Trump is winning among young men. He's got 51% of the vote among young men to 39% for Harris. 62% of young women support her. And then it's roughly the same in Nevada where men support Trump more than Harris and women support Harris more than Trump.So really the issue is that she's winning, but she's not winning by as much as Biden did. And so that's really going to be the key. He won those states narrowly, and if she doesn't win by enough votes among the Latino voters, she probably will not hold those two key swing states.Taylor Wilson:In terms of policy, Karen, what are the top concerns for poll respondents and really, how do these compare to policy priorities from the two major candidates?Karen Weintraub:Inflation, the economy, as in most other states, are the top issues in both of those states. In Nevada, 37% of Latino voters said that it was their top issue. In Arizona, 29% said that it was. Immigration is the second most important issue for both states. 17% in Nevada, 15% in Arizona, and then abortion is third or fourth in those states, 8% Nevada, 11% in Arizona.Trump clearly has made immigration and inflation, the economy a top issue on his campaign. Reproductive rights and the economy are top issues for Harris. And we're seeing more or less the issues are consistent across the country. People care about the same things regardless of the states. People in border states care about immigration, people who are way far away from the border care about immigration.Taylor Wilson:So Karen, you touched on this a bit, but really just how vital will Arizona and Nevada be for whoever wins the election next month? And would these be good enough numbers for Harris to win these states, or is this really a positive sign for Trump?Karen Weintraub:It's too soon to tell is the short answer. Every poll we've seen statewide, national polls really are within the margin of error. In this case with Latino voters. Harris leads beyond the margin of error. Will it be enough? Who knows? This is going to be a nail-biter. This is going to come down to, I was going to say election day, but it's probably going to come down to after election day.We probably won't know that night because we're going to have absentee ballots, things coming in the mail a couple of days later, hand counting. So it's going to be very close. And these swing states, it may be tens of thousands of votes in a few key swing states that are going to make these decisions.So particularly, if you live in one of these swing states, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania is hugely important. Michigan, Georgia, everybody's vote matters, but your vote really, really matters. So get out there and cast your ballot.Taylor Wilson:Karen Weintraub is an editor with USA TODAY. I appreciate your insight as always, Karen. Thanks so much.Karen Weintraub:Thank you.♦Taylor Wilson:A federal judge yesterday granted preliminary approval to the slightly revised version of a multi-billion dollar settlement of three athlete compensation antitrust against the NCAA and the Power Five conferences. The decision moves the college athletics organization and the conferences closer to funding a $2.8 billion damages pool for current and former athletes over a span of 10 years and sets the stage for a fundamental change in college sports. Division one schools being allowed to start paying athletes directly for use of their name, image, and likeness, subject to a per school cap that would increase over time, but additional legal appeals could be on the way. You can read more about those with the link in today's show notes.♦And thanks for listening to the Excerpt.

       "  'More than 10,000 books were banned in public schools during the 2023-2024 academic year, according to a new PEN America report. American Library Association data shows that while the country saw a decrease in the first eight months of 2024, the number of bans and challenges still exceeds that of 2020, when the increase started.Book banning, which the ALA defines as restricting access to material by removing temporarily or indefinitely, has been the subject of fiery debate in courts and classrooms, libraries and living rooms.It’s prompted a wave of advocacy. Banned Books Week is one such initiative, and librarians in “book sanctuaries” are standing in solidarity with school libraries facing challenges and bans from politicians and parents alike.Though protesting – rallying, holding literacy events or even filing lawsuits – is central to much of the fight against book banning, some libraries are taking quieter, equally impactful steps.Check out:USA TODAY\\'s weekly Best-selling BooklistIn 2022, the Chicago Public Library declared itself a book sanctuary or “a physical or digital space that actively protects the freedom to read.” Book sanctuaries can exist in classrooms, libraries, coffee shops, bookstores and even personal collections.\\xa0Among other things, they collect banned or challenged books and make them readily available to readers.Chicago has a decadeslong history of fighting book banning. It was the first public library in the country to issue an intellectual freedom statement in 1936, even before the ALA’s Library Bill of Rights. It even housed the ALA when it was first established, says Chris Brown, Chicago Public Library commissioner.\\xa0“As these book challenges were on the rise, we were really at a moment (of) reflecting on our history and our core values and realizing that we want to remind everyone what we stand for,” Brown says.\\xa0From there, the movement cascaded. Libraries around the country reached out to Chicago. Today there are more than 4,000 book sanctuaries throughout the U.S.Hoboken Public Library became the first book sanctuary in New Jersey in 2023 after it hosted a banned-book readathon, which prompted social media attacks, most of them from outside the community. Taking a stand as a book sanctuary was a way to “uplift the majority statement,” says library director Jennie Pu. The community saw overwhelming support, she says. Later, the entire city declared itself as a Book Sanctuary City.“This declaration to the world, saying, we don’t censor, we don’t ban books. In fact, we actively collect books and stories that are being banned,” Pu says.The majority of Americans don’t support banning books. One ALA survey of almost 1,500 voters and public school parents found that 71% oppose removing books from public libraries, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents. A 2023 NPR poll found similar numbers across party lines.In Kentucky, Paris-Bourbon County Library declared itself a “First Amendment library” after one family challenged 102 books in a short period. Most of the titles related to the experiences of marginalized people. Removing them would have been “antithetical to everything that I believed in,” director Mark Adler told USA TODAY.\\xa0He waited until a board meeting to make his decision – if the community was OK with the removal, he would resign. If they opposed the challenges, he would “stay and fight for them.”Those opposed to book removals outnumbered supporters by the hundreds.\\xa0“We had people across the political spectrum, we have people from both of the major parties on (the board) and they were highly supportive. They don’t feel anybody has the right to tell somebody else what to read, and certainly not to tell somebody else’s children what to read,” Adler says.\\xa0Recent legislation across the US allows removal and objection to school library titles containing sexual content, even if that content is not pornographic. Some have used that provision to challenge titles containing mention of sexual violence or an LGBTQ+ person or relationship.According to the American Library Association, 47% of the 4,240 unique book titles targeted for censorship in 2023 were about or by LGBTQ+ people and people of color.“Our collections have to be diverse and be a reflection of our society we live in, meaning you can’t just have one kind of viewpoint represented,” Pu says. Book sanctuaries \"provide at least some baseline protection so a librarian can do our job and curate a thoughtful, diverse collection of all kinds of voices.”Even in Texas, a state with the second-highest number of book bans, the Harris County Public Library system felt an outpouring of support when it declared itself and its branches a book sanctuary.As the schools around them were removing titles from their shelves, director Edward Melton thought it was necessary to have a safe place for students to access information outside of the classroom. Though being a book sanctuary doesn’t provide any legal guardrails, it helps the staff feel comfortable doing their jobs without the threat of retaliation. It’s also a comfort to know the Commissioner’s Court, the local governing body, supports the right to read in Harris County, Melton says.“We thought initially this would be treading into some shark-infested water – it really hasn’t been that experience,” he says.Since adopting the resolution last year, Harris County has fully embraced the fight against book banning. The county authorized a mural downtown protesting book bans. It\\'s also hosting concerts and book talks for Banned Books Week.\\xa0Chicago has seen similarly far-reaching support. A year after the public library declared itself a book sanctuary, Governor J.B. Pritzker signed a bill making Illinois the first state to outlaw book banning.Much of the book banning debate gets lost in semantics, Melton says. He approached the question by going back to basics. When he uses the phrases “intellectual freedom” and “censorship,” he says people connect the dots about what’s really happening.\\xa0Similarly, that’s why Adler and the Paris-Bourbon County Library opted for the phrase “First Amendment library.”\\xa0“I don’t care what your background is, what you’re interested in reading,” Adler says. “If you’re interested or have some drive to learn about something, my responsibility as a librarian is to help you find your material.”Before becoming a book sanctuary, Melton recommends librarians first have a thoughtful conversation with local government officials to cut above the other politically charged language they may have heard.“In America, no one wants to be censored. Everyone wants to be able to have intellectual freedom in terms of choosing what they read or choosing what information they consume,” Melton says. “It’s a fundamental right people really embrace. So if you start talking about taking away someone’s intellectual freedom, that’s when the community really gets up in arms.”And though the libraries are on the front lines, Brown says, anyone can get involved. For influencers, it could be making a video about banned books. For cafes and bookstores, it could be displaying frequently challenged titles.“The more we have voices pointing out the importance of this that aren’t necessarily working in the field, the more it sends a message that this is an important issue and this is something that affects people.”Contributing: Anna Kaufman',\n",
       "  \"How much do presidential debates matter? The first presidential debate of 2024 changed the entire trajectory of the presidential race, but normally debates aren't that consequential, usually resulting in a net shift of 2 or 3 points in the polls.However, in a close race such as this year's presidential election, which will turn on a handful of battleground states, even a small shift could alter the outcome.When one candidate is not well-known, debates can make a difference filling in the picture. Voters know former President Donald Trump well, but they still feel they don’t know that much about Vice President Kamala Harris.One of the questions we hear frequently about her record as vice president is, “What has she done?” The debate gives her an opportunity to fill in her record, her style of leadership and her toughness.Debates are the great equalizer when people feel they can compare the leadership and character of the candidates side by side in a neutral environment. Voters judge their style, their treatment of opponents and the way they handle tough questions.Trump is known to not treat his opponents well – or even civilly – so it is relevant that in this debate, the microphones will be live only for the candidate who is responding to a question, imposing a standard of dignity and composure that might not otherwise be on display.The muted microphones benefitted Trump in his first debate with President Joe Biden this year, unlike the presidential debates in 2020 and 2016 when Trump constantly interrupted and badgered his opponents to the point where Biden said, “Will you shut up, man?”The Gen Z vote:Trump's campaign is courting Gen Z frat bros. I'm not convinced it will help.The first debate between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 was the most-watched presidential debate in history, and while we don’t anticipate the Harris-Trump matchup will approach that level, we do expect more will tune in than watched the earlier debate with Biden.How much might the Harris-Trump matchup resemble the first Clinton-Trump debate?Like Harris, Clinton was leading narrowly in the national poll averages ahead of their first debate. She came off as confident and well prepared. When Trump interrupted her, she didn’t appear rattled.At one point, the debate moderator asked Trump to explain what he meant by an earlier comment that Clinton doesn’t have “the presidential look.” That created an opening for Clinton to itemize the disparaging comments Trump had made about women.Will Americans vote for a woman?Why Harris' biggest obstacle is gender.This year, Trump has said that Harris would be a “play toy” for world leaders, which is something the debate moderators may ask him to elaborate upon. Will Harris exploit it if given a chance, or change the subject as she has done when he has criticized her laugh or racial identity?Clinton leaned more heavily into gender in 2016, with talk about breaking the glass ceiling and the historic nature of her candidacy. Harris has kept the issue of gender more in the background and is more likely to focus on the issue of abortion rights and individual freedoms.According to the post-debate polls, Clinton was perceived to be the winner of all three debates she had with Trump. And on Election Day, Clinton beat Trump among the two-thirds of voters who said debates were an important factor in their decision, but lost handily to Trump among the 30% who said the debates didn’t play much of a role in their decision.Debates matter, but they aren’t the only thing that matters. Many people, in fact, will not watch the actual debate but rely on news coverage (or social media) to learn what happened.One of the most memorable examples of the impact that media coverage had on perceptions was during the 1976 presidential election between President Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.After their second debate, voters thought Ford had won and was significantly more likable. By the next morning when the press emphasized that Ford had declared that Poland was not under the control of the Soviet Union, voters shifted to thinking that the president had badly lost, according to internal campaign polling.What will the news media say about the Harris-Trump debate? Interpretations may vary. We can expect that Fox News won’t show the same clips as MSNBC, so maybe it’s best to tune in for yourself.Celinda Lake, president of\\xa0Lake Research Partners, was one of two lead pollsters for Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign. She also is a pollster for the Democratic National Committee. Christine Matthews, president of\\xa0Bellwether Research, is a leading public opinion pollster known for her understanding of swing voters, particularly women.\",\n",
       "  'PARIS – Let’s make one thing very clear off the top. There isn’t a sane human being on Planet Earth who believes that a man should be boxing women in the Olympics.Not a single one.That said, let’s also say something equally as important: Slow down.Of course, it’s already too late to contain the mania that is exploding around the Internet right now after Algerian boxer Imane Khelif’s gender was questioned Thursday following a welterweight match that ended after 46 seconds when Italy’s Angela Carini took one punch and called it quits.The video of the punch is out, and it’s vicious. The International Boxing Association (IBA) claims that Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan failed “gender eligibility tests” at the 2023 world championships. The IOC says they’re eligible to compete. The Italian coach serves up suspicions and hearsay. There’s no transparency around any of the actual facts.And, of course, all the same grifters who dine out on “men in women’s sports” controversies are waking up to this news back in America and salivating over their next conquest.So the horse is out of the barn now. It’s an issue. It’s a thing.And with Khelif set to box again Saturday and Lin on Friday, it cannot be ignored.But again – and this may be screaming into the void – everyone needs to take a breath, slow down and let the actual facts unfold.Because here\\'s the thing: There aren\\'t a whole lot of facts right now. There are, however, plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the explosive narrative that a man was boxing women at the Olympics when you consider the underlying issues with that claim.Let’s talk about some things we know, and some things we don’t know.We know that on Wednesday, the IBA issued a statement saying that Khelif and Lin did not undergo a testosterone examination but failed “a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential” during the IBA Women’s World Boxing Championships in India in March of 2023.We don’t know what kind of tests those were, what they were testing for or which organization oversaw the lab work. If you aren’t aware, those details are kind of a big deal in the Olympic world: Just look at the war going on between the World Anti-Doping Agency and the U.S Anti-Doping Agency over the 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive before the Tokyo Olympics three years ago but were allowed to compete in deference to Chinese anti-doping officials who claimed food contamination was at fault.This stuff isn’t always black-and-white.We don’t know exactly what Khelif and Lin are being accused of, by the IBA or anyone else. Is the idea that they’re men pretending to be women? Intersex issues that affect chromosomes or reproductive organs? There’s no indication – at all – that this has anything to do with transgenderism.So what’s the actual theory here? Being clear about that matters not just on a human analytical level, but on a specific scientific level relative to what kind of testing the IOC would do that would allow them to compete. The IOC is adamant that it will not release any of that information. The IBA, to this point, has been vague about any testing specifics.A 2023 story in the Taiwan News at the time of Lin’s disqualification said no explanation was given other than “an abnormality” and that she had never failed a gender test in the past. Some contemporaneous news reports around Lin’s disqualification speculated about women boxers having to take certain medications to adjust their menstrual cycles to match the competition schedule.Here’s something else we also know: The IBA has been in a long-running dispute with the IOC, and as a result, boxing’s future in the Olympics beyond the Paris Games is up in the air.What’s the dispute about? In a word: Russia.When Umar Kremlev became the IBA president in 2020, he made his mark by signing a significant sponsorship deal with Gazprom, Russia’s state energy supplier. It is understood that Gazprom essentially funded the IBA’s entire operation.Early in 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result, the IOC wanted the IBA to drop Gazprom and make other reforms to its governance and financial structures and to clean up a bevy of ethical issues.Unsatisfied with the IBA’s response – including a claim that Gazprom’s sponsorship expired at the end of 2022 – the IOC stripped its sanction of the Olympic boxing tournament. The IBA appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but was turned down on April 2 of this year for a variety of reasons, including the IBA’s continued lack of financial transparency, continuing issues with its referees and judges and failure to fully implement the government reform measures demanded by the IOC.So here’s this long-running dispute between the IOC and a fully Russian-backed boxing organization, coming to a head at an Olympics where the Russians are truly personae non gratae. In fact, there are just 15 Russians competing under a neutral flag at these Olympics, nearly half of them playing tennis. The rest of them either opted out or did not pass the IOC’s neutrality standards, which primarily weeded out anyone who actively supported the war in Ukraine.Meanwhile, after the controversial opening ceremony, Kremlev, the IBA president, posted a video to X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he called IOC president Thomas Bach the “chief sodomite” and his team “society’s outcasts.”What does all of this mean? It’s hard to say for sure, but if you think the IBA throwing gas on this story is entirely about chromosomes and testosterone, I have a dacha in Volgograd to sell you.What else do we know? We know that Khelif and Lin have been competing in this sport for years,\\xa0including the Olympics three years ago, and were not exactly dominating the competition. Khelif lost in the quarterfinals in Tokyo and Lin lost in the round of 16 of a different weight class. They were also being tested without any issue coming up, until this sudden 2023 test that nobody can really explain.Amy Broadhurst, an Irish world champion boxer who has been in the ring with Khelif and beaten her, posted on X that, \"Personally I don\\'t think she has done anything to \\'cheat\\'. I thinks (sic) it\\'s the way she was born & that\\'s out of her control. The fact that she has been (beaten) by 9 females before says it all.\"She followed: \"If this is a man and it becomes 100% fact, I\\'ll be disgusted that I was in the ring and so was many others. A man vs a woman is far from ok. But right now nobody knows what the true facts are.\"We also know – or can at least safely speculate – that in Khelif’s case, Algeria would be a strange place to incubate a star women’s boxer who was actually a man or began life as a man. This is a Muslim country where same-sex acts are illegal and the LGBT community is subject to significant discrimination. Algeria\\'s Olympic committee has issued a statement strongly denying what it called \"baseless propaganda\" and \"unethical targeting and maligning of our esteemed athlete.\"So when you put all this entire fact pattern together, there are far too many unanswered questions and obvious agendas here for the American political right-wing to send this train down the tracks in good faith.

       "  \"WASHINGTON — Amid highlighting his record on protecting and advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday slammed JD Vance’s recent comments that school shootings are a “fact of life.”“It’s a fact of life that some people are gay,” Walz said during remarks at the 2024 Human Rights Campaign National Dinner in Washington, D.C. “But you know what's not a fact of life? Our children being shot dead in schools.”Four people were killed Wednesday during a school shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, and eight students and one teacher were injured.Vance, one day after the shooting, called school shootings a “fact of life” and advocated for more security in schools.“I don’t like that this is a fact of life,” Vance said during a rally in Phoenix, Arizona on Thursday. “But if you are a psycho and you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets. And we have got to bolster security at our schools.”Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.Walz, speaking to roughly 3,500 people at the dinner on Saturday, highlighted his and Vice President Kamala Harris’ record in advocating for LGBTQ+ rights. He noted Harris was among the first to officiate same-sex marriages in the country.During his time as a high school teacher at Mankato West in Minnesota, Walz was the faculty advisor for the school’s first gay-straight alliance club in 1999. He noted that one of the students who helped start the alliance, Jacob Reitan, was at the HRC dinner on Saturday.“It's easy to be an ally, what really matters is knowing who's going to be at your side to stand up when it's hard,” Walz said.Throughout Saturday’s dinner, Walz repeatedly punched back at Vance, and the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\\xa0Walz said Trump during his presidency “didn’t do anything” to help end childhood poverty.\\xa0“They didn't do anything on lowering childcare costs,” Walz said, before referencing a rambling response Trump gave recently to use tariffs to pay for child care. “Did you hear? He's got a plan on childcare costs that no one in the world understood a damn word about.”While Walz slammed the Republican ticket, he also said that Democrats have to run on a plan and not just “hope” that they win.Walz laid out what he and Harris would do if they are elected to serve as the next administration – from lowering taxes for working families to enacting family and medical leave. He added that Harris and him would make sure to help pass and sign into law the Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in health care, housing, education and the law.“You look around this room, you can feel hope... We hope we win this election. We hope we pass these laws. We hope we lift people out of poverty,” Walz said. “But my wife always reminds me of this, it's not a damn plan.”“It's not a plan to hope we win this election. We've got to have a plan. We've got to work for it,” Walz said.\",\n",
       "  \"Alex Morgan is the rare athlete whose impact off the playing field was as great as it was on it.Maybe even greater.Morgan, who announced her retirement Thursday, leaves the game as a two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist. She’s fifth on the U.S. women’s national team’s all-time scoring list, with only five of her 123 goals coming from the penalty spot. She was runner-up twice for FIFA’s Player of the Year, and third another time, and her six appearances on FIFPRO’s World XI is second-most in history.More significantly, Morgan leaves women’s sports in a far better spot than they were when her career began. She was instrumental in the USWNT’s fight for equal pay and played a significant role in the NWSL’s first-ever contract. The league’s first anti-harassment policy was a direct result of her efforts. She helped spark the current investment boom in women’s sports, pushing sponsors and potential owners to recognize their growth potential.She knew her star status gave her influence, and she used it for the greater good.“Charlie came up to me the other day and said that when she grows up, she wants to be a soccer player,” Morgan said in her retirement announcement, referring to her young daughter. “It just made me immensely proud. Not because I wish for her to become a soccer player when she grows up, but because a pathway exists that even a 4-year-old can see now.“We’re changing lives,” Morgan said, her voice choking. “The impact we have on the next generation is irreversible, and I’m proud in the hand I had in making that happen and pushing the game forward and leaving it in a place that I’m so happy and proud of.”Morgan, now 35, didn’t set out to be a disruptor. She wanted to play soccer, a sport she’s loved for as long as she can remember. But very soon after joining the USWNT, she found herself cast as America’s sweetheart, inheriting the role Mia Hamm once had.Soccer fans loved her ruthlessness — there’s more than a few opposing goalkeepers who still get the shakes at the memory of Morgan bearing down on them — and those who didn’t know much, or care, about the game were captivated by her wholesome good looks. At a time when tennis players and Olympians were the only women athletes to have any kind of commercial success, Morgan became an exception.But rather than insulating her, Morgan’s privileged status brought the wrongs that existed into sharper focus. When Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Becky Sauerbrunn and Hope Solo filed a wage discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016, Morgan joined them.“I felt significantly younger and more inexperienced than” the others, Morgan told USA TODAY Sports last year. “I felt like, in that moment, that was an opportunity to learn, to get out of my shell and feel uncomfortable even when doing the right thing.“And so I think that was a pivotal moment for me, in realizing this platform that I have and this opportunity that I have in front of me to be able to say something and have people listen.”OPINION:How Alex Morgan grew from USWNT rising star to powerful advocate: 'She’s been incredible'That complaint would be the precursor to the equal pay lawsuit, which the USWNT players filed three months before the 2019 World Cup. Morgan became the lead plaintiff, knowing her name and fame would draw more attention to the case and increase the pressure on U.S. Soccer.Though she and Rapinoe were the public faces of the lawsuit, which resulted in a landmark contract in 2022, Morgan’s involvement went well beyond that. Becca Roux, executive director for the USWNT Players Association, recalled Morgan returning documents with edits and notes. She was an active participant in calls with attorneys and advisers.But her activism wasn’t limited to equal pay. Once she found her voice, Morgan raised it for a variety of issues.She was outspoken in support of racial equality and LGBTQ+ rights. She was a steadfast ally to Mana Shim, her then-teammate who reported an abusive coach, and when Shim’s story became public, Morgan was unflinching in her demands that both the NWSL and U.S. Soccer do more to protect players. Frustrated with the lack of coverage of women’s sports and women’s athletes, Morgan joined with Sue Bird, Chloe Kim and Simone Manuel to create Togethxr, a media and commerce company.She also wrote a series of children’s books, The Kicks, that promote teamwork and positivity for young girls. And when critics called the USWNT “arrogant” during the 2019 World Cup for having the audacity to own their greatness, Morgan pushed back — hard — at the double standard and the misogyny behind it.“I'm so proud of what I've done because of having Charlie and knowing that she isn't going to have to fight the battles that I had to fight,” Morgan told USA TODAY Sports last year. “My hope is that I fight for it now so she doesn't have to. She gets to just have fun. She gets to play. She gets to do what she loves without worrying about that.”Morgan is one of the greatest to ever play the game, in this country or any other. But it's the work she did to level the playing field for the girls and young women who come after her, in soccer and every other sport, that make her a legend.Follow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.\",\n",

       "  \"The Paralympic Games remind the world of fascinating tales of perseverance, advocacy and inclusion. These events provide a new lens on disability every four years.\\xa0But the juxtaposition of the Olympics and the Paralympics hides a secret, namely that disabled athletes competed − and won − in the 2024 Paris Games.But they weren’t counted.USA Climbing’s national team, which won its\\xa0first medal\\xa0this summer in Paris, is made up of\\xa064% athletes with disabilities.Swimmer Katie Ledecky, the\\xa0most decorated American female\\xa0Olympian of\\xa0all time with 14\\xa0medals, has been diagnosed with\\xa0postural orthostatic tachycardia.USA gymnast Suni Lee medaled in Paris though she lives with an\\xa0incurable kidney disease. Teammate Simone Biles, the GOAT of Olympians, has been diagnosed\\xa0with ADHD.And it’s not just these exceptional, name-brand athletes, either: 15% to 20%\\xa0of Olympic athletes experience asthma.The USA’s Olympic history has featured other people with disabilities. Michael Phelps, the Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer, has a disability: severe depression that made him\\xa0suicidal and unable to leave his room.\\xa0Jeff Float\\xa0swam the third leg of the 4x200 freestyle relay and helped the team take first place in 1984. But did you know viral meningitis rendered Float virtually deaf as a child?\\xa0Born without a right hand, Jim Abbott\\xa0helped the U.S. baseball team win gold in 1988 in Seoul.\\xa0Marla Runyan, a blind runner, competed in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics.Ultimately, not identifying these athletes as disabled sends a confusing message to the public about disabilities, which aren’t always visible: Disabilities don't hold people back.Gender parity is just the start:Gender equality at the Olympics is a gold medal victory. But there's still work to do.Ever since 2016, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has been generating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Scorecards\\xa0for every sport the committee governs.They measure the number of women, people of color, veterans and people with disabilities on staff, the board of directors and the national teams of each sport because the\\xa0Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act\\xa0requires it. To diversify national teams, the U.S. Olympic Committee established guidelines for gender, race and disability.In 2021,\\xa0USA Swimming counted\\xa0zero disabled athletes, even though it fielded a Paralympic team that year and Ledecky competed as well. USA Gymnastics also had zero, even though Lee and Biles were on the 2020 team.As Congress\\xa0amended\\xa0the law in 2008 to counteract a narrowing judicial interpretation of a disability, Ledecky’s, Lee’s, Biles’ and other athletes’ conditions count as disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\\xa0This lack of representation on national teams may come down to disclosure: Labeling oneself as disabled brings stigma and possible discrimination. Many people who qualify as disabled prefer not to think of themselves this way.\\xa0The Stevens Act doesn’t require this data to appease the identity preferences of the athletes. Instead, it’s an important aspect of representation and compliance with international standards. The\\xa0United Nations'\\xa0Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities says: “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to encourage and promote the participation, to the fullest extent possible, of persons with disabilities in mainstream sporting activities at all levels.” \\xa0Disabled athletes on mainstream teams are supposed to be the norm − and perhaps they are. But few would know it, based on the DEI Scorecards.\\xa0Ledecky, Lee, Biles and Phelps began competing before the onset of their conditions. Phelps explained that he could keep swimming because he had so many coaches and guides who were invested in his athletic success\\xa0− most likely because that was obvious before his disability.If their disabilities had emerged before their athletic prowess, their stories might be different and include fewer wins.This doesn’t mean that the Olympic and Paralympic teams should merge; there’s good reason to separate the Olympics and the Paralympics. As the International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee agreed 23 years ago, certain athletes would\\xa0overshadow\\xa0others who finally find the limelight in the Paralympic Games.Los Angeles, you're up:Summer Games closing ceremony means America is next. And IOC, I have questions.Paralympic champions and Olympic athletes prove that disability and sports shouldn’t be divorced in the American psyche. These current athletes are examples − I know this from helping students with autism play tennis: Some are good, but the coaching opportunities for them don’t exist.The truth is few people expect disabled individuals to excel at sports. As a result, people with disabilities are less likely to be coached or go out for a team.It’s a perennial problem that the Department of Education\\xa0addressed over 10 years ago.\\xa0The 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles are\\xa0not far away. National teams should survey their athletes, update their scorecards and show how many athletes are disabled on both the Olympic and the Paralympic squads − and not just for accuracy.To help future athletes, we must acknowledge that not all disability is on the Paralympic side.Harshita Ganga is a junior at William Mason High School in Ohio.

       "  'Kara Welsh and Rebecca Cheptegei would seem to have had little in common.Welsh was an American gymnast, a Division III national champion on vault two seasons ago. At 21, she was about to begin her senior year in college. Cheptegei was a Ugandan runner who finished 44th in the marathon at the Paris Olympics last month. At 33, she had two young daughters.Within days of each other, though, Welsh and Cheptegei were dead, their lives cut short in the same horrific and inexcusable way. Like far too many other women, both in this country and around the globe, Welsh and Cheptegei were killed by their intimate partners.It does not matter who you are or where you live or what you do or how old you are. Until society values women equally, until women are seen as having the same worth as men, all women are at risk.“We have allowed it to happen that we don’t even condemn it anymore,” Viola Cheptoo Lagat, a Kenyan runner who started Tirop’s Angels to combat domestic violence after fellow marathoner Agnes Tirop’s murder in 2021, told Voice of America after Cheptegei died Thursday.“We’ve made it a norm to see a woman being beaten — to see somebody snatching somebody’s property and us not screaming out loud about it until somebody is lost.”The details of both Welsh and Cheptegei’s killings are grim and, naturally, drew widespread horror and condemnation.Welsh was shot eight times by her boyfriend Aug. 30, according to the criminal complaint against Chad T. Richards released Friday. Though he told police it was self-defense, detectives said Welsh’s wounds and evidence at the scene suggest at least some of the shots were fired while she was in a fetal position.Cheptegei suffered burns on 80% of her body after her ex-boyfriend doused her in gasoline Sunday and lit her on fire. She died four days later after her organs failed.Awful as both these incidents are, they\\'re examples of what happens every day across the world.Around 48,800 women and girls were killed by intimate partners or family members in 2022, according to a United Nations report on femicide released last November. That means more than 133 women are killed each day by a family member or intimate partner.Not hurt or hospitalized.Killed.These numbers include women who are killed in the middle of a dispute. Women killed after being raped. Women killed in dowry or \"honor\" killings. Women who were trafficked. Women accused of witchcraft. And on and on.Those killings don’t occur in vacuums, either. These girls and women leave shattered loved ones behind. Like Cheptegei’s daughters, who were with their mother when she was attacked and had to watch her burn.Or Welsh’s older sister, Kaeli.“My little sister, Kara, was my life. She was always smiling, always knew just what to say to make people laugh, and was my overall favorite person on the planet,\" Kaeli Welsh said during a Tuesday court appearance for Richards.And much as we’d like to pretend domestic violence doesn’t happen to anyone we know, the numbers show that can’t possibly be true.In North America alone, the UN reports almost 2,500 women and girls were killed by family members or intimate partners in 2022. While femicide rates in South and Central America dropped between 2017-2022, numbers in North America rose — by 29% — and the U.N. said the increase is largely driven by the United States.“The United States has recorded an increase in female intimate partner/family-related homicides in recent years, especially since 2020,” according to the report.Now consider how many incidents of domestic violence still go unreported or, if they are reported, unpunished, and you begin to get an idea of the scale of the crisis. Men still make up the vast majority — 80% — of homicide victims worldwide, but women are 66% of the victims in intimate partner killings.The proliferation of guns in the United States is partly to blame. But the way we continue to allow women to be demeaned and marginalized is just as damaging.The former president of the United States was found by a civil jury to have sexually abused a woman and it hasn’t disqualified him from again being the Republican nominee. His running mate, meanwhile, insults women almost every time he opens his mouth, suggesting they have little use other than to have and take care of children.Abortion restrictions threaten the health and safety of women. Women still face barriers in corporate America and in government. Schools continue to shortchange their female students, athletes in particular.When these are the examples our boys and young men see, is it any wonder some think women don’t have equal value? When this is the environment surrounding them, can we really be surprised if some consider the bodies and souls of women expendable?The outrage and soul-searching over what caused Welsh and Cheptegei’s deaths is encouraging. But there were 132 other women who died the day Welsh did. There were 132 more who died on the day Cheptegei did. Those girls and women were worth just as much, and their deaths were equally senseless.It has to stop.Follow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.',\n",

She described Beau Biden as a “close friend” and “mentor.” Since his passing in 2015, she has developed a friendship with his father President Joe Biden who authored the foreword to her 2018 memoir \"Tomorrow Will Be Different.\"“My admiration for her sense of perspective and purpose grew when she interned at the White House, becoming the first transgender woman ever to do so,” the president wrote. “I know Beau was proud to have known Sarah. Jill and I share his pride.”When he announced he was ending his reelection campaign and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, McBride praised his decision, saying he \"saved democracy\" in 2020 and is doing it again this year by passing the torch to Kamala Harris and a new generation.“She has been a constant for the Biden family for nearly two decades,\" Louisa Terrell, former assistant to the president and director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, said in a statement to USA TODAY . \"From Beau’s first attorney general campaign to the launch of the Biden Foundation, she has given invaluable counsel, and she will continue to be a leader — in partnership with her colleagues on both sides of the aisle — in the fight to ensure that every single American is afforded the dignity of being who they are.”Prep for the polls:See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter GuideMcBride was raised in Wilmington in the district she currently represents. She attended American University and majored in political science. Before running for public office, she served as a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest American LGBTQ advocacy group.State Attorney General Kathy Jennings first met McBride in 2013 when she was fresh out of school and testifying before the state senate in support of the Gender Identity Non-Discrimination Act.Jennings, who was one of the first people to endorse McBride last summer, said her testimony\\xa0was a major reason the legislation passed in 2013. She remembers putting her arm around McBride and telling her she was “really going places” after watching her address the state senate.“It was obvious she was a leader from the very beginning,” Jennings said. “When she became a Delaware senator, she started immediately swinging for the fences . . . but I became convinced that if anyone could do it in the entire legislature, it was Sarah McBride.”While in office, McBride took on big issues in the state senate, pushing successful legislation to guarantee paid family leave, expand health care affordability, and increase gun safety.Donyale Hall, one of McBride\\'s Republican opponents who lost the primary to Whalen Tuesday, told USA TODAY she would support measures expanding school choice and blocking transgender students from participating in girls sports.Jennings said McBride developed a reputation as a “peacemaker” by working across the aisle in the state senate. But Hall disputes that reputation, citing Democrats\\' majority in both state legislative chambers.\"Senator McBride touts how all this legislation that has been going through the General Assembly has all this bipartisan support,\" Hall said. \"These bills, quite frankly, don\\'t have bipartisan support, because they can pass them all by themselves, and they\\'re not representing the best interests of the people.\"Still, McBride says she wants to apply her skills as a unifier to a Congress currently experiencing one of the most divided and least productive sessions in history.Virginia State Sen. Danica Roem, who became the first transgender person elected to any state legislature in 2017, said she has developed a supportive friendship with McBride over the years. Roem applauded McBride\\'s ability to introduce successful bipartisan legislation even as a freshman state senator.But she warned McBride may face some hostility as well.\"People who go to Washington, D.C. for the objective of being on television and \\'driving the conversation\\' without ever passing legislation of their own will hate her.

They\\'re going to find out really quickly that she\\'s a trans woman and, not but, and she\\'s a two-term state legislator who passed a lot of bills by working across the aisle and getting things done.\"McBride pointed to her record in Delaware as proof of her ability to listen and work with Republicans, but whether she will be able to bridge partisan divides in a deeply polarized US House of Representatives remains to be seen.McBride continues to have a friend in Roem, who described a time when she called McBride to express her support for her campaign.\"I told her, \\'I did my historic first.\\' I told her, \\'This is your time,\\' \" Roem said.Rachel Barber is a 2024 election fellow at USA TODAY, focusing on politics and education.

       "  'The moderators at Tuesday night’s presidential debate know full well what they’re going to get out of Donald Trump.Asked about an economic plan, he’ll say the word “tariffs” over and over, as if that means anything. Asked about immigration, he’ll say something along the lines of, “Two words: Mass. Deportation. Two beautiful words.” Questioned on his past lies about the 2020 election or any of his multitudinous legal problems, he’ll say “RIGGED” and “WITCH HUNT” until exhaustion sets in.Sprinkle in a heavy dose of bigotry and not-too-veiled racism and a bit of far-off-topic rambling and that’ll be that. Trump has the depth of a kiddie pool. If he’s asked general debate questions by ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis, they’ll get the same load he dumps on his rally goers.Many see this debate as pivotal moment for Trump’s opponent. The thinking is that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, having replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in late July, has yet to fully introduce herself to voters.That’s fine, and I hope the moderators ask the vice president smart and pointed questions.But of at least equal importance is that Davis and Muir press Trump on the absurd and dangerous things he has said, and demand specifics from a man who avoids specificity like he avoids the truth.Why is Trump getting a pass?Trump is 78 and barely coherent. Where\\'s everyone who questioned Biden\\'s age and fitness?I have my doubts that the moderators are up to the task.Simply presenting Trump as a normal presidential candidate standing onstage next to the sitting vice president without also highlighting that he\\'s a convicted felon who refused to participate in the peaceful transfer of power is giving the man a leg up.The reality, for those who still believe in such a thing, is that Trump is a historically abnormal candidate.He spouts conspiracies like a high-pressure sprinkler, he has been indicted for attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election, he paints a dystopian picture of present-day America and he\\'s surrounded by people who keep going to prison.He never shuts up about \"the late, great Hannibal Lecter,\" and he\\'s forever fleecing the followers he has hooked with violent rhetoric, selling them Trump-branded sneakers and Christmas ornaments and cheap hats.Sadly, normalizing him has become reflexive for news outlets in moments like this. So if the moderators want to do a true public service for voters, they will ask Trump questions like these:Dick Cheney picks Kamala Harris,giving conservatives a final path to save GOP from TrumpIf part of the moderators’ job is to help voters learn more about Harris, then it’s incumbent on them to ask questions that pierce Trump’s armor of blather.When he doesn’t answer, they need to ask follow-ups, and they should continue until he reveals something beyond his carnival-barking patter.It’s a tall task, but anything less is a disservice.\\xa0Follow\\xa0USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke\\xa0on X, formerly\\xa0Twitter,\\xa0@RexHuppke\\xa0and Facebook\\xa0facebook.com/RexIsAJerk',\n",
       "  'PITTSBURGH, Pa. ― Vice President Kamala Harris walked off Air Force 2 and into the wind. Her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, was right behind.She flashed a broad smile and waved at the crowd before grabbing onto the railing. Emhoff offered his arm. Harris was the most powerful woman in the country. She was also his wife.The couple descended, step by step, until they reached the bottom together.Emhoff had seen his spouse through high-profile campaigns over the last decade. And now, he was doing everything to help her become president.Sometimes, it’s lending an arm. Sometimes, it’s procuring a bag of Doritos.Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.“Ahh, Dougie,” Harris\\' face lit up at a gas station pitstop as Emhoff handed Harris her favorite chips — a staple snack on the trail. “I know you wanted those,” he replied.Emhoff hasn’t seen much of his wife in recent weeks. Ever since Harris formally accepted the Democratic nomination for president, their conversations usually follow a single track – where he\\'s been, where he’s headed, what he’s hearing from voters, volunteers and donors.“I’m crawling over glass,” Emhoff told a group of roughly five dozen of Harris’ supporters who’d crammed inside the Montgomery County Democratic Party’s headquarters in Norristown to hear him speak last Sunday ahead of a canvas.\\xa0Harris was in Pittsburgh, preparing for her debate with former President Donald Trump. Emhoff was on the campaign trail in her stead.He has been on the road nonstop since she launched an eleventh-hour bid to win the White House. Emhoff is headlining fundraisers, rallies and volunteer appreciation events across the country, while Harris fulfills her duties as vice president, builds out her campaign platform and introduces herself to voters in battleground states.A “guy’s guy” who intersperses quips about his Fantasy football team with knocks on his wife’s Republican opponent, Emhoff has redefined the role of the nation’s second spouse as he hustles to help Harris become the first female president of the United States.“The model of masculinity he\\'s presenting is one where you can still like sports. You can still like to hang out with your friends. You can still like to defend your family from threats and be supportive of your wife in her role as the leader of the free world–\\xa0 or the leader of whatever organization she is in charge of,” former Harris communications director Jamal Simmons said.Emhoff is Harris’ closest confidante, staunchest defender and eyes and ears on the trail. Although he reports back on his trips and tip-toes into policy at times, a dozen allies, former aides, and people close to the couple who spoke to USA TODAY, some of whom requested anonymity to discuss private interactions, said he does not act as an adviser to the vice president.He wants voters to know his wife is a \"badass,” who has what it takes to run the country, in the face of heightened media scrutiny and a litany of insults from Trump. That she loves her country, understands business and has an agenda for average Americans.‘That’s all he’s got?’:Harris\\' husband Doug Emhoff slaps back at Trump“I love him. I think that his support of his wife is exactly what I want to see white men in America doing. I think that he is representing what it looks like to stand behind a powerful woman,” said Carol Vinatieri, a Harris volunteer from Abington, who’s training to become a precinct captain.Vinatieri, 33, attended the Norristown canvas launch with her husband, Josh Linder, 32. Linder said that Emhoff, a former entertainment lawyer, is a “role model for men” like himself.\\xa0In his role as second gentleman, Emhoff has already shown what it’s like to be a nurturing spouse. Emhoff quit his job at the global law firm DLA Piper, where he was a partner, in 2020 after Harris and President Joe Biden won the election. He took up teaching at Georgetown Law as a second career while devoting much of his time to supporting the Biden-Harris administration in the unpaid position of second gentleman.His support has ranged from the personal to the official. When his wife tested positive for COVID, Emhoff shared a close-up of her working from home. After a busload of migrants were dropped off at the vice presidential residence in a bid by GOP governors to embarrass her, Emhoff went outside to talk with them as a human being about their struggle. He did so without the knowledge or prior permission of Harris’ staff.Were the couple to make it to the White House, Emhoff would take on the position of first gentleman. He would be expected to assume new responsibilities that have traditionally been carried out by first ladies, helping with state dinners, putting on open houses and picking out holiday decorations. Emhoff is Jewish and says he’d put a mezuzah in the residence.The role of first lady has varied and evolved over time. First lady Jill Biden was the first spouse of a president to work in a paid position outside of the White House. Emhoff could do the same.For much of the past century, men were customarily cast as the breadwinner in most American families. But like Emhoff\\'s case, it\\'s becoming more common for women to be the leading lady: 16% of married couples now have a woman who earns more than her spouse, up threefold from the 1970s, according to Pew Research.Emhoff tries not to be a scold. He wants his ascent to signal to men throughout the country that there’s more to their identity than their work.“I’ve always been proud of the work that I’m doing, it’s an important part of my life. But sometimes I take pride in supporting my wife and making a great life for us together,” Linder explained. “And so when I see what Doug did, I\\'m seeing that\\'s a model for me.”The couple met in 2013 through a friend. Emhoff was divorced with two teenage children; Harris was the California attorney general. They hit it off immediately. Love struck for the pair in their late 40s. They married the following year. They celebrated their 10 year wedding anniversary the night Harris accepted the Democratic nomination.Emhoff has always seconded Harris’ political ambitions. He traveled with his wife as often as he could during her 2019 campaign for president. He was a prolific fundraiser for Democrats in the lead up to the 2022 midterms.But the vice president’s husband has taken on a more prominent role now that she’s leading the ticket.\\xa0The Norristown event was one of three that Emhoff did last weekend in Pennsylvania. He also took a rare evening off to see the band Pearl Jam in Philadelphia with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.He’d just come off a swing that included a trip to Los Angeles, a fundraiser in Chicago, and a night in Pittsburgh, where he finally caught up with Harris.\\xa0“Even in the few minutes that we have together, and we\\'re barely seeing each other, and it\\'s not the happy couple talk these days, it\\'s get back out there,” he said in Allentown on Saturday.But he returned to Pittsburgh the next evening the be with his wife. Walking hand-in-hand with her husband, Harris said she was ready to face Trump. Emhoff was off to North Carolina.He’s attended nine fundraisers that have raised more than $7 million in the three weeks since Harris formally accepted the nomination. A tenth one, in Mississippi, is scheduled for Friday. He’s appeared at another ten political events, including one on Friday in Florida. He says he’ll sleep on Nov. 6 once voting has concluded.“His steadfast support of Vice President Harris is a powerful example of how men can champion women in leadership,” Montgomery County Board of Commissioners chair Jamila Winder told the crowd in Norristown. “He shows us what it means to be an ally, one who listens, advocates and stands shoulder to shoulder in the fight for equality.”His work on issues such as gender equity and abortion rights has complemented his wife’s. It was at Harris’ urging that he took up that work and leaned into the Biden’s administration’s fight against antisemitism, Emhoff has said on several recent occasions.Much like his candidate wife, who has appeared more comfortable as the nominee than she did as Biden’s running mate, Emhoff is embracing the spotlight.“They\\'re now representing themselves and are willing to take risks that articulate who they are at their very core,” said Ashley Etienne, a senior advisor to the Biden-Harris campaign in 2020 who went on to work for the vice president.Emhoff has been a crucial reinforcement for Harris on the trail – and not just when it comes to hopscotching between swing states. He appeared at a Jewish Democratic Council of America event in Chicago on the day Harris accepted her party’s nomination and said at the Democratic National Convention that Harris brought him closer to his faith.“The foundation of his work is her support of it,” JDCA executive director Halie Soifer, a former adviser to Harris on national security, said. “It is her policy that he is advancing.”Trump has sought to make Harris’ stance on Israel a voting issue. He claimed at their debate that she hates Israel; Harris told him that’s not true.Emhoff made a point of stating that Harris “has fought against antisemitism and all forms of hate her whole career” in his convention remarks.“I think it does kind of give it an air of credibility to hear it coming from her husband, who is a Jew,” said Isaac Kaufer, 27, a Somerville, Mass. resident and full-time volunteer for Democrats, after Emhoff’s appearance at the JDCA event.Kaufer said the second gentleman’s address was one of his favorites at the convention.Emhoff talked about the awkward and rambling voicemail he left Harris before their first date. He said she makes him listen to it every year on their anniversary. She did so again on the final day of the convention.“The story he told was very, like, vulnerable,” Kaufer said. “It contrasts well with the Republicans.”Harris wasn’t there. She was in Milwaukee. She circled her plane above the convention site after the event so she could see his remarks while in the air.\\xa0Emhoff acknowledged that his first marriage ended in divorce. His son, Cole, spoke about the break-up in a video that his ex-wife, Kerstin, produced for the convention. She attended the DNC alongside Cole and daughter Ella and has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ presidential bid.“Our blended family wasn\\'t used to politics or the spotlight. But when Kamala became senator, we were all excited to step up, especially my dad,” Cole said.The term “blended family” is one Emhoff uses frequently.“Don\\'t worry about us. We\\'re fine,” he told an Allentown crowd on Saturday afternoon, after he referenced Trump’s personal attacks on Harris. “We got each other. We got that big, beautiful, blended family. They\\'re going to love us up.”In Norristown, at the volunteer event, Vinatieri said she’s had multiple, independent voters tell her how refreshing it is to see a family on the national stage that looks like theirs.“Everyday Americans, who are sitting down for their dinner and pick up their phone to talk to me, are saying, I identify with her, I identify with this family,” Vinatieri said. “I think that\\'s really powerful.”Emhoff hopes they also see the first female president.Francesca Chambers\\xa0is a\\xa0White Housecorrespondent for USA TODAY.\\xa0Follow heron X, formerly Twitter, @fran_chambers.',\n",

       "  \"Vice President Kamala Harris' first extended television interview since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race in July and endorsed her as the Democratic presidential nominee aired Thursday evening on CNN.The program, a prime-time special hosted by Dana Bash, also marked Harris' first joint interview with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.Transcript created by CNN.comBASH:\\xa0Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me and bringing the bus. Bus tour is well underway here in Georgia. You have less time to make your case to voters than any candidate in modern American history. The voters are really eager to hear what your plans are. If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House?HARRIS:\\xa0Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you first and foremost one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward in a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by — by hope and by optimism.Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.I think sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans — really dividing our nation. And I think people are ready to turn the page on that.BASH:\\xa0So what would you do Day One?HARRIS:\\xa0Day One, it’s gonna be about one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. I’ve already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we’re gonna do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we’re gonna do to invest in America’s small businesses, what we’re gonna do to invest in families.For example, extending the child tax credit to $6,000 for families for the first year of their child’s life to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib. There’s the work that we’re gonna do that is about investing in the American family around affordable housing, a big issue in our country right now. So there are a number of things on day one.BASH:\\xa0What about you?WALZ:\\xa0Well, I’m excited about this agenda, too. As I said, the idea of inspiring America to what can be. And I think many of these things that the vice president’s proposing are — are — are things that we share in values. And the child tax credit’s one we know that reduces childhood poverty by a third. We did it in Minnesota. To have a federal partner in this —unbelievable, I think, in the impact that we can makeBASH:\\xa0You talk about — you call it the opportunity economy. You are well aware that right now many Americans are struggling. There’s a crisis of affordability. One of your campaign themes is, “We’re not going back.” But I wonder what you say to voters who do want to go back when it comes to the economy specifically because their groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president.HARRIS:\\xa0Well, let’s start with the fact that when Joe Biden and I came in office during the height of a pandemic, we saw over 10 million jobs were lost. People — I mean, literally we are all tracking the numbers. Hundreds of people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed.In large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under 3%. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world.But you are right. Prices in particular for groceries are still too high. The American people know it. I know it. Which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries. For example, dealing with an issue like price gouging.What we need to do to extend the child tax credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first-time home buyers so they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home, which is part of the American dream and their aspiration, but do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream.BASH:\\xa0So you have been vice president for three and a half years. The steps that you’re talking about now, why haven’t you done them already?HARRIS:\\xa0Well, first of all, we had to recover as an economy, and we have done that. I’m very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than 3%, the work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. Donald Trump said he was gonna do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Never happened. We did it.So now, and I — as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited, I’ve met — I was in Nevada recently. A grandmother who showed me her receipts. And before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month she was paying hundreds of dollars, up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin. She’s not doing that any longer.BASH:\\xa0So you maintain Bidenomics is a success.HARRIS:\\xa0I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost — of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000; when we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%; when we do what we have done to invest in the American people and bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business back to America; what we have done to improve the supply chain so we’re not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs, I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work.BASH:\\xa0I want to get some clarity on where you stand on some key policy issues. Energy is a big one. In — when you were in Congress, you supported the Green New Deal. And in 2019 you said, quote, “There is no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania.HARRIS:\\xa0Sure.BASH:\\xa0Do you still want to ban fracking?HARRIS:\\xa0No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.BASH:\\xa0In 2019, I believe in a town hall you said — you were asked, “Would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office?” and you said, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking. So yes.” So it changed in — in that campaign?HARRIS:\\xa0In 2020 I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024, and I have not changed that position, nor will I going forward. I kept my word, and I will keep my word.BASH:\\xa0What made you change that position at the time?HARRIS:\\xa0Well, let’s be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far.The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest by my calculation over t— probably a trillion dollars over the next ten years investing in a clean energy economy. What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me from my experience as vice president we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana — Dana, excuse me — I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand.BASH:\\xa0And was there some policy or scientific data that you saw that you said, “Oh, okay. I get it now”?HARRIS:\\xa0What I have seen is that we can — we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.BASH:\\xa0Okay. Another issue, big one, is immigration. As vice president you were tasked with addressing the root causes of migration in southern countries and —HARRIS:\\xa0Northern part of Central America.BASH:\\xa0The northern parts of —HARRIS:\\xa0Yeah.BASH:\\xa0—\\xa0of — of Central America that deals with, that affects the southern border of the US. During the Biden-Harris administration, there were record numbers of illegal border crossings. Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions?HARRIS:\\xa0Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as vice president, that I was asked to do by the president has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we’ve began that work.But I will say this: That Joe Biden and I and our administration worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border. And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted which we supported, which I support.And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would’ve — that contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, “Don’t put it forward.” He killed the bill: a border security bill that would’ve put 1,500 more agents on the border. And let me tell you something. The Border Patrol endorsed the bill. And I’m sure —(OVERTALK)HARRIS:\\xa0— and I’m sure in large part because they knew they were working around the clock and 1,500 more agents would help them. That bill would have allowed us to increase seizures of fentanyl. Ask any community in America that has been devastated by fentanyl what passing that bill would have done to address their concern and a pain they’ve experienced —BASH:\\xa0So you would — so you would push that legislation again? I just want to ask ab—HARRIS:\\xa0Not only push it. I will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it.BASH:\\xa0Just one other question about something that you said in 2019 when you first ran. There was a debate. You raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be decriminalized. Do you still believe that?HARRIS:\\xa0I believe there should be consequences. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequences. And let’s be clear, in this race, I’m the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. I’m the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws. And I would enforce our laws as president going forward. I recognize the problem.BASH:\\xa0Generally speaking, how should voters look at some of the changes that you’ve made — that you explained some of here — in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you’ve learned more about the information? Is it because you’re running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you’re saying now is gonna be your policy moving forward?HARRIS:\\xa0Dana, I think the — the — the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America and by extension the globe around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the passage, illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values did not change.So that is the reality of it, and four years of being vice president, I’ll tell you, one of the — the — the aspects to your point is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I’m here in Georgia, I think somebody told me 17 times since I’ve been vice president in Georgia alone. I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to — to — to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems.BASH:\\xa0On that note, you had a lot of Republican speakers at the convention. Will you appoint a Republican to your Cabinet?HARRIS:\\xa0Yes, I would.BASH:\\xa0Any one in mind—HARRIS:\\xa0Yes, I would. No, no one in particular in mind. I got — we got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not puttin’ the cart before the horse. But I would. I think — I think it’s really important. I — I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who is a Republican.BASH:\\xa0Speaking of Republicans, I want to ask you about your opponent, Donald Trump. I was a little bit surprised, people might be surprised to hear that you have never interacted with him, met him face to face. That’s gonna change soon, but what I want to ask you about is what he said last month. He suggested that you happened to turn Black recently for political purposes, questioning a core part of your identity.HARRIS:\\xa0Yeah.BASH:\\xa0Any—HARRIS:\\xa0Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please. (LAUGH)BASH:\\xa0That’s it?HARRIS:\\xa0That’s it.BASH:\\xa0OK. Let’s talk about some foreign policy issues that would be on your plate if you become commander-in-chief. President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He’s been doing it for months and months, along with you. Would you do anything differently? For example, would you withhold some US weapons shipments to Israel? That’s what a lot of people on the progressive left want you to do.HARRIS:\\xa0Let me be very clear. I’m unequivocal and — and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself. And that’s not gonna change. But let’s take a step back. October 7, 1,200 people are massacred, many young people who are simply attending a musical festival. Women were horribly raped. As I said then, I say today, Israel had a right — has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. And we have got to get a deal done. We — we were in Doha. We have to get a deal done. This war must end—BASH:\\xa0And in the meantime—HARRIS:\\xa0And we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I’ve met with the families of the American hostages. Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done.BASH:\\xa0But no change in policy in terms of arms and — and so forth?HARRIS:\\xa0No. I — we have to get a deal done. Dan — Dana, we have to get a deal done. When you look at the significance of this to the families, to the people who are living in that region — it — a deal is not only the right thing to do to end this war but will unlock so much of what must happen next.I remain committed since I’ve been on October 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Paletin — the Palestinians have security and self-determination and — and dignity.BASH:\\xa0Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you’ve described your service in the National Guard.WALZ:\\xa0Yeah.BASH:\\xa0You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed actually in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you?WALZ:\\xa0Well, first of all, I’m incredibly proud. I’ve done 24 years of wearin’ uniform of this country. Equally proud of my service in a public school classroom, whether it’s Congress or — or the governor. My record speaks for itself, but I think people are coming to get to know me. I — I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about — about our children being shot in schools and around — around guns. So I think people know me. They know who I am. They know where — where my heart is, and again, my record has been out there for over 40 years to — to speak for itself.BASH:\\xa0And the — the idea that you said that you were in war, did you misspeak, as the campaign has said?WALZ:\\xa0Yeah, I said — we were talking about in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war. And my wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar's not always correct. But again, if it’s not this, it’s an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it’s an attack on my dog. I’m not gonna do that, and the one thing I’ll never do is I’ll never demean another member’s service in any way. I never have and I never will.BASH:\\xa0And just one other question, because, again, this is all new. This was not — however many days ago, this was not on either of your bingo cards, especially yours. You had to clarify that you had said that you and your wife used IVF, but it turned out you used a different kind of fertility in order to have children. And then when you ran for Congress in 2006, your campaign repeatedly made false statements about a 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving. What do you say to voters who aren’t sure whether they can take you at your word?WALZ:\\xa0Well, I’ve been very public. I think they can see — my students come out — former folks I’ve served with, and they — and they do, they vouch for me. I certainly own my mistakes when I make ‘em. The one thing I’ll tell you is I wished in this country we wouldn’t have to do this. I spoke about our infertility issues ‘cause it’s hell, and families know this. And I — I spoke about the treatments that were available to us that — that had those beautiful children there. That’s quite a contrast in folks that are trying to — to take those rights away from us.And so I — I think people know who I am. They know that record. They’ve seen that I’ve taught thousands of students. I’ve been out there. And I — I won’t apologize for speaking passionately, whether it’s guns in schools or protection of reproductive rights. The contrast could not be clearer between what we’re running against. The vice president’s position on this has been clear. And I think most Americans get it, if you’ve been through that. I don’t think they’re cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they’re cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child.BASH:\\xa0Vice President Harris, you were a very staunch defender of President Biden’s capacity to serve another four years right after the debate. You insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people?HARRIS:\\xa0No, not at all. Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now. And I’ll tell ya it’s one of the greatest honors of my career, truly. He cares so deeply about the American people. He is so smart and — and loyal to the American people. And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. He has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president.By contrast, the former president has none of that. And so — one, I — I — I am so proud to have served as vice president to Joe Biden. And, two, I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz for president of the United States and to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward, and turn the page on the last decade of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies.BASH:\\xa0With the last decade, of course, the last three and a half years has been part of your administration.HARRIS:\\xa0I’m talking about an era that started about a decade ago where there is some suggestion, warped I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on you beat down instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. That’s what’s at stake as much as any other detail that we could discuss in this election.BASH:\\xa0Because we haven’t had a chance to — to talk, I’m just curious, staying on President Biden, when he called you and said he was pulling outta the race, what was that like? And did he offer to endorse you right away or did you ask for it?HARRIS:\\xa0It was — it was a Sunday, so, here, I’ll — I’ll give you a little too much information. (LAUGHTER)BASH:\\xa0Go for it. There’s no such thing, Madam Vice President.HARRIS:\\xa0My family was staying with us. And — including my baby nieces. And we had just had pancakes and, you know, “Auntie, can I have more bacon?” “Yes, I’ll make you more bacon.” And then we were gonna sit — we were sitting down to — to do a puzzle. (LAUGH) And the phone rang. And it was Joe Biden. And — and he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, “Are you sure?” And he said, “Yes.” And — and that’s how I learned about it.BASH:\\xa0And what about the endorsement? Did you ask for it?HARRIS:\\xa0He was very clear that he was gonna support me.BASH:\\xa0So when he called to tell you, he said, “I’m pulling outta the race and I’m gonna support you?”HARRIS:\\xa0Well, my first thought was not about me to be honest with you. My first thought was about him to be honest. I think history is gonna show a number of things about Joe Biden’s presidency. I think history is gonna show that in so many ways it was transformative, be it on what we have accomplished around finally investing in America’s infrastructure, investing in new economics, in new industries, what we have done to bring our allies back together, and have confidence in who we are as America, and grow that alliance, what we have done to stand true to our principles including the — the — one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity.And I think history is gonna show not only has Joe Biden led an administration that has achieved those extraordinary successes, but the character of the man is one that he has been in his life and career, including as a president, quite selfless and puts the American people first.BASH:\\xa0I just have to ask you both about two standout moments, aside of course from the addresses that you both gave, but standout moments that were perhaps unexpected during the convention. You mentioned one of them, governor, a moment that you shared, that the world shared with your son, Gus. You were speaking. The camera caught him so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, “That’s my dad.”WALZ:\\xa0Yeah. I — I don’t know as a father I could’ve ever imagined that. I — I’m grateful for so many reasons to be on this ticket. But that moment — to understand what was really important, to — to have my son feel a sense of pride in me, that I was trying to do the right thing. And it was, you know, you try and protect your kids. You know it brings — it brings notoriety in things. But it was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I’m — I’m just — I’m grateful I got to experience it. And I’m — I’m so proud of him.I’m proud of him. I’m proud of Hope. I’m proud of Gwen. She’s a wonderful mother. And these are great kids. And I think the one thing is, talking about the era we’re in, is our politics can be better. It can be different. We can — we can show some of these things. And we can have families involved in this. And I — I hope that there was — I hope people felt that out there. And I hope they hugged their kids a little tighter, because you just never know. And life can be kinda hard.BASH:\\xa0And last question, Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral. You were speaking. One of your grand nieces that you were just talking about was watching you accept the nomination. You didn’t explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech. But it obviously means a lot to a lot of people. And that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you?HARRIS:\\xa0You know, I — listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender. But I did see that photograph. And I was deeply touched by it. And, you’re right, she’s — it’s the back of her head, and her two little braids, and — and then I’m in the front of the photograph obviously speaking. It’s very humbling. It’s very humbling in many ways.BASH:\\xa0Did she talk to you about it afterwards?HARRIS:\\xa0Oh, she had a lot to talk (LAUGHTER) about. She had a lot. She listened to everything. And she listens to everything.BASH:\\xa0She gave you her hot takes?HARRIS:\\xa0Oh, yeah, definitely. Uh-huh. (LAUGH)BASH:\\xa0Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.HARRIS:\\xa0Okay, thank you.WALZ:\\xa0Thanks for having us.HARRIS:\\xa0Thank you, Dana. Thank you.\",\n",
       "  'As with the Olympic opening ceremony, my three-generation family will be watching Sunday\\'s closing ceremony. Like millions of our fellow earthlings, we\\'ve been glued to our screens on all platforms for so much of the Summer Games in the past two weeks that I wouldn\\'t dream of missing the finale.My family will remember the Paris Olympics for so many viral moments, including:A much more down-to-earth feat, though, will be what sticks with me after the 2024 Summer Games. It\\'s also what brought a few questions to mind.On opening ceremony evening July 26, NBA international superstar Steph Curry swapped Olympic pins with as-yet-unknown Olympians like a giddy kid at summer camp. When he realized he had just met the U.S. women\\'s table tennis team, Curry brought the star-struck Asian Americans to where his mostly African American basketball teammates were hanging out and goaded Anthony Edwards, who prides himself on excelling in many sports, that these seemingly demure ladies could shut him up.Friendly trash talk followed, with the 23-year-old Minnesota Timberwolves guard Edwards saying, \"I don\\'t believe it. I\\'m scoring at least once,\" and the 28-year-old Olympic veteran Lily Zhang smilingly responding, \"There\\'s only one way to try it out.\"Olympic boxers deserve compassion:But questions of fairness shouldn\\'t be brushed aside.I instantly followed @usabasketball and @usatabletennis_ on Instagram, but so far, there\\'s been no word of this match that so many on social media have demanded. This sparked the first of several questions I have for Olympians as well as Olympic organizers:When can we see Ant play Ping-Pongwith Lily? It\\'s heartwarming that Edwards showed up to cheer Zhang on as she advanced to the round of 16. And bravo that his team invited her squad to basketball practice, where they traded souvenirs and autographs. But the U.S.\\xa0Major League Table Tennis could use the help of NBA gods to gain support. Take pity on us mere mortals and hold an exhibition.Where\\'s Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva? In February 2022, during the Beijing Winter Games, I wrote a column saying, \"I have never wanted a 15-year-old to fail so much in my life. But when\\xa0(Valieva) executed her short program\\xa0... that\\'s exactly what her team\\'s handling of her\\xa0positive drug test\\xa0had reduced me to\\xa0– a spiteful fan who loved\\xa0her during the pre-Olympics competitions but now feels betrayed. ... Russia grabbed\\xa0gold, the USA earned silver and Japan won\\xa0bronze.\"Olympics diversity:Would you call Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles or Suni Lee a \\'DEI hire\\'?As USA TODAY Sports columnist Christine Brennan wrote this past week: \"The Russian scandal ... forced the original medal ceremony to be canceled and triggered an infuriating series of international delays and appeals, finally ending with a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling less than two weeks ago.\" On Wednesday, the\\xa02022 U.S. Olympic figure skating team ‒ including \"Rocketman\" Nathan Chen ‒ finally got their gold medals and the Japanese skaters got their silver, all surrounded by their loved ones at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.But what about Valieva? Now two years older but still a teenager, did she watch the medal ceremony somewhere? What is she up to? Who does she blame for losing gold?How long before gender-parity Olympics lead to gender-neutral Games? Paris witnessed\\xa0the first-ever Olympics to reach\\xa0gender parity. In 2016, as the Summer Games wrapped up in Rio de Janeiro, I co-wrote an editorial advocating, \"Let men and women compete head-to-head in shooting.\"Josh Rivera and I reasoned: \"For decades, men and women shooters competed against each other in international events. At the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, American\\xa0Margaret Thompson Murdock\\xa0tied for first with teammate Lanny Bassham in the small-bore rifle competition. After the judges examined the targets, they awarded the gold medal to the man and the silver to the woman. To Bassham’s credit, he asked Murdock to share the top podium with him as the national anthem played.\"After that, the International Olympic Committee phased out mixed-gender shooting and created events just for women. Yet in the 21st century, shooting remains one of the\\xa0few collegiate sports that’s gender blind ‒ and in which women are highly competitive. It’s time to take a fresh look at which sports lend themselves to head-to-head competition, regardless of gender.\"Equestrian\\xa0remains the only Olympic sport that\\'s gender neutral. So our editorial question from eight years ago still stands: \"If the horse doesn’t care who’s handling it, why should a gun?\"How will Los Angeles beat the Paris Olympics\\' opening ceremony? I can\\'t wait to see how Sunday\\'s closing ceremony will compare with the opening ceremony\\'s historic parade of nations on boats down the River Seine. But L.A. holds the next Summer Games. How do you top the Eiffel Tower? Traditionally, at a closing ceremony, the next Olympic host also puts on a show to tease coming attractions. There are rumors that Tom Cruise, who\\'s been prominently attending numerous Olympic events around Paris, will execute some wild stunt.Hollywood, bring it.Thuan Le Elston, a\\xa0USA TODAY Opinion\\xa0editor, is the author of\\xa0\"Rendezvous at the Altar: From Vietnam to Virginia.\"',\n",
       "  'When it comes to maintaining optimal health, one of the most important things to do is to stay informed. Getting age-appropriate screenings for diseases and conditions such as high blood pressure or cancer, for instance, can help you avoid the worst outcomes of either ailment. Understanding vaccination guidelines, the benefits of aerobic and anaerobic exercise, and learning how much sleep is needed to fully rest and replenish your body each night is also important.But perhaps the most vital bit of information to stay on top of is keeping track of what\\'s going into your body. That means paying attention to the ingredients and nutrition labels of the foods you and your family eat. \"Learning how to read a nutrition label is important for those who want to increase their self-awareness around what they are consuming, be it for casual or medical reasons,\" says Tara Schmidt, lead registered dietitian for the Mayo Clinic Diet.Food labels, sometimes called nutrition facts labels, are the black and white vertical rectangles you see on the side of food packaging. You\\'ll find them on your favorite brands of milk, chips, soda, cereal, lunch meat and pretty much everything in between. Each food label is divided into two sections: the ingredients list and its nutritional value contents.\\xa0\"The ingredients list shows you what’s in a food,\" says Karen Collins, a registered dietitian and nutrition adviser to the American Institute for Cancer Research. She explains that such ingredients are listed in descending order by weight so that the first ingredient shown is the most prevalent ingredient and the last ingredient listed consists of the smallest quantity. Because of this, \"it’s easy to check items like breads and cereals for whether a whole grain is actually listed first,\" she offers as one example.The other part of the food label shows the nutritional value of the package\\'s contents. Such information includes the macronutrient composition of the food such as the amount of carbs, protein and fats. \"It also includes certain nutrient quantities per serving as well as sodium content and the amount of added sugars,\" says Dr. Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and the author of \"Calm Your Mind with Food.\"Hmm:Which is the healthiest cereal? Try these fiber-rich, nutritious options.Such information can help you plan meals and snacks each day and prevent you from eating high quantities of foods with ingredients that are connected to negative health outcomes. \"Nutrition labeling is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for most packaged foods,\" says Collins, but she explains that the labels are not required on raw fruits and vegetables. \"And labeling on meat, poultry and eggs is regulated by the USDA, not the FDA,\" she adds.\\xa0\\xa0Naidoo says these labels were first implemented as part of a public health outreach program, \"to promote healthy food choices appropriate to each individual consumer.\"The more you know:Is popcorn healthy? Learn about calories and the downsides of one of our favorite snacks.Learning how to read these labels and which nutrients to look out for or avoid can be helpful. The first thing you\\'ll find on the label is the serving size, followed by its number of calories and then the nutrients contained therein.\\xa0All this information is based on a daily value (DV) of a 2,000-calorie diet, but \"you may eat fewer or more calories a day depending on your age, gender, activity level, current weight and whether you’re trying to lose or maintain your weight,\" notes the\\xa0Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention.Paying attention to these labels in accordance with your diet means keeping track of how much of each serving you\\'re actually eating. The serving size for many brands of breakfast cereal, for instance, is often only one cup, but many people eat two or three cups in a single sitting.In general, Schmidt says it\\'s best to pay attention to the presence of nutrients you know are good for you in each food such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K, plus minerals like calcium, magnesium, iron and potassium. She says it\\'s also good to look at the total amount of dietary fiber included in each food and to avoid or minimize eating items that have a lot of\\xa0added sugars, trans fat, saturated fat and sodium.\"It is also good to be guided by the number of calories, but remember not all calories are equal,\" cautions Naidoo. \"For example, a medium-sized apple and a bag of potato chips may have about the same number of calories but are entirely different foods, as the apple is nutrient-dense and full of fiber and the potato chips are an ultra-processed food high in sodium,\" she explains. \"That\\'s why the other items listed on a nutrition facts label are also important to pay attention to.\"',\n",
       "  'A Tennessee law could determine the future of gender-affirming care nationally now that the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to take up a case over a constitutional battle concerning transgender people\\'s rights.Since 2022, the number of states banning gender-affirming care for minors has skyrocketed from four to 25, and the justices will be asked whether this is about a state\\'s right to regulate health care access or whether these bans violate the civil rights of transgender people \"on the basis of sex.\"Witnessing the evolution of Tennessee\\'s law, I believe these laws came about in response to anti-trans fervor fueled by far-right politicians who saw limiting trans people’s rights as a winning issue for their base.If the Supreme Court is true to precedent, justices must side with the vast majority of district court judges who have decided that the bans are blatantly unconstitutional and at least in one ruling \"based on bigotry.\"However, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti clearly disagrees.The lawsuit bears his name − L.W. v. Skrmetti −and he said he plans on “finishing up the fight” over whether state bans on gender-affirming care for minors are constitutional.At issue:Skrmetti’s position clearly falls in the first camp. After all, his role is to defend the laws of Tennessee, in this case, the Prohibition on Medical Procedures Performed on Minors Related to Sexual Identity Act of 2023.However, multiple federal district judges have ruled against or agreed to halt enforcement of laws in different states because they raise questions over whether lawmakers infringed upon the constitutional rights of transgender minors and their parents.My daughter is trans:I\\'m the parent of a trans daughter. There\\'s nothing conservative about blocking her care.On Monday, Skrmetti issued a public statement:\"We fought hard to defend Tennessee\\'s law protecting kids from irreversible gender treatments and secured a thoughtful and well-reasoned opinion from the Sixth Circuit. I look forward to finishing the fight in the United States Supreme Court. This case will bring much-needed clarity to whether the Constitution contains special protections for gender identity.”Except that the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals’ 2-1 majority did not really answer the key question, and the judges presumed the plaintiffs would lose.Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton and Judge Amul Thapar reversed a lower court injunction on enforcing Tennessee and Kentucky’s bans and allowed the case to proceed in the legal system.They acknowledged the existence of gender dysphoria, but they said that the relative newness of certain treatments, including puberty blockers, made it difficult to determine the long-term consequences of the treatment.“Prohibiting citizens and legislatures from offering their perspectives on high-stakes medical policies, in which compassion for the child points in both directions, is not something life-tenured federal judges should do without a clear warrant in the Constitution,” they wrote.In other words, they punted on the constitutional question.In her dissent, however, Judge Helene White did not mince words:“Tennessee’s and Kentucky’s laws tell minors and their parents that the minors cannot undergo medical care because of the accidents of their births and their failure to conform to how society believes boys and girls should look and live. The laws further deprive the parents – those whom we otherwise recognize as best suited to further their minor children’s interests – of their right to make medical decisions affecting their children in conjunction with their children and medical practitioners. For these reasons, I dissent.”Dahron Johnson, Nashville co-chair of the Tennessee Equality Project, said in a statement about the high court taking up the case that Tennessee \"has abused its power in a brazen overreach seeking to gain access to the medical records of transgender and gender-diverse Tennesseans.\"\"As the Supreme Court takes up (the case), we trust that the Court will recognize the ways Tennessee, in banning such care, has sought to undermine that trust and communication, blocking access to life-saving health services for our state’s gender-diverse children,\" she added.This month, a federal judge blocked Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, ruling it unconstitutional. Judge Robert Hinkle went further in his ruling and called the law out as legislation “based on bigotry.”“This is a politically fraught area. There has long been, and still is, substantial bigotry directed at transgender individuals,” Hinkle wrote. “Common experience confirms this, as do some of the comments of legislators recounted above. And even when not based on bigotry, there are those who incorrectly but sincerely believe that gender identity is not real but instead just a choice. This is, as noted above, the elephant in the room.”Hope amid Republican attacks:Judge struck down Florida ban on gender-affirming care for trans kids. It\\'s the right move.Before Tennessee’s enactment of its ban, state and federal lawmakers embraced a 2022 claim from The Daily Wire right-wing outlet claiming Vanderbilt University Medical Center \"castrate, sterilize, and mutilate\" children – something that still has yet to be proven.But Republican politicians, including Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, held a \"Rally to End Genital Mutilation\" in front of the state Capitol just weeks before the start of the legislative session.In a 2023 guest opinion, trans activist Jace Wilder offered three reasons why the state should not ban care.\"How is it that a ban, that only last year was seen as\\xa0too extreme in this state by its leaders, is being pushed through now? The factor that may come to mind is what we keep hearing: \\'It\\'s to protect the kids from mutilation.\\' This isn’t the case,\" he said.State lawmakers also wrote guest essays in The Tennessean explaining why they were introducing the ban on gender-affirming care for minors.“Cultural forces from the left\\xa0would like us to accept an alarming new myth; that gender is not a biological reality,” wrote House Majority Leader William Lamberth in one column 2022 shortly before the rally. Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson wrote a defense of the bill in early 2023 during the session. They co-wrote an essay last August defending the law.Over the past several years, the Tennessee General Assembly has made national headlines for targeting LGBTQ+ rights in athletics participation, bathroom use and the community’s inclusion in curriculum students learn.The Supreme Court ruled in the 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision that employment discrimination against people based on gender identity was unconstitutional under the Civil Rights Act. Hopefully, the justices will use similar logic to protect the rights of transgender children and their parents to access medical care.There is political gain in enacting these bans, but it doesn’t mean lawmakers are right.David Plazas is the director of opinion and engagement for the USA TODAY Network Tennessee, where this column first appeared.

       "  'I began playing basketball at my school in Kabul, Afghanistan, at age 14. Because of the Taliban, I have been a refugee twice. First in Iran as a child, and now a second time, I am outside my country. When my family returned to Afghanistan in 2003, I was in the first generation of girls able to return to school and play many sports.But basketball for girls – and indeed all sports – was not widely accepted in Afghan society, and as female athletes, we were frequently threatened by extremists. It was a radical act for me as a girl to hold a basketball or to wear athletic clothes. So, I would wear my Converse All-Star shoes off the court – in public – to make the point that I and all women and girls had the right to play sports.Before the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the number of female athletes was growing in Afghanistan. In order to even get to the playing fields and tournaments that other athletes worldwide take for granted, we women had to become human rights advocates, educators and community leaders. Sports became our vehicle for promoting our own rights, including the rights to health and education. Ultimately, millions of Afghan women and girls were able to play sports in school, ride bikes and dream of sports scholarships, competing for our country and even opening gyms or building businesses around sports.Today, Afghan women and girls have been forced off the courts, away from tracks and out of gyms by the Taliban, who took over the government of my country for a second time in August 2021. In the weeks after Kabul was captured, the Taliban overturned 20 years of progress in women’s rights. Girls were no longer allowed to attend school after the sixth grade, women could not work and female athletes had to burn their jerseys, bury their medals, hide sports equipment or flee the country.Where are all the women?Our eyes don\\'t deceive us. The men are fleeing Afghanistan.Yet, when the Paris Olympics open this week, three Afghan women athletes will be visibly leading in the parade of nations on the River Seine, along with three Afghan male athletes. The women Olympians had to leave Afghanistan to represent Afghanistan at the Paris Games.Following the Taliban takeover, thousands of male and female Afghan athletes sought refuge abroad where they could continue training and competing. This includes past Olympians and Paralympians, national athletes in dozens of sports and members of the Afghan women’s national soccer, basketball and cricket teams.Who made the cut for Paris Olympics:USA basketball Olympic women\\'s team rosterEven as the Taliban are minimizing and restricting all women’s rights, in Paris, women Olympians will proudly represent our country to an audience of billions on the world stage.As a former women’s national basketball team player, I am proud of all the athletes from my country, and that I can represent them as a female International Olympic Committee member.The Olympic Charter outlines the principles that guide the work of the IOC, including opposing gender-based discrimination. This is why the IOC recognizes and supports the Afghan women Olympians, even though the Taliban government does not.Afghan sprinter Kimia Yousofi will compete in her third Olympics in Paris. Kimia says she represents \"the stolen dreams and aspirations” of women and girls in Afghanistan ‒ “those who don\\'t have the authority to make decisions as free human beings.”Kimia and other Afghans competing in Paris are the clearest sign the Taliban have not succeeded in crushing women’s sports nor women’s spirits.The Taliban crave international recognition. No country or United Nations body has accepted their legitimacy to govern, chiefly because of their ongoing discrimination against women.The IOC has rightly barred Taliban officials from attending these Paris Games, which are the most gender-equal ever.But this is not the endgame for Afghan women and girls. There is still an urgent need for governments, the U.N. and other key players to apply pressure to restore Afghan women’s basic human rights.As we cheer all athletes at the 2024 Olympics and Paralympics, we should not forget the 20 million Afghan women and girls who are denied their basic rights to access education, work, health – and sports.Samira Asghariis a former Afghan women’s national basketball team captain who later worked for the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee. She was elected to be a member of the International Olympic Committee in 2018 at the age of 24, becoming the first IOC representative from Afghanistan, and one of the youngest-ever members.',\n",

I\\'m Dana Taylor. Today is Thursday, August 8th, 2024, and this is a special episode of The Excerpt. It\\'s been just over two weeks since President Joe Biden took the extraordinary step of stepping down from the 2024 presidential race making Vice President Kamala Harris only the second female ever to make it to the top of a presidential ticket and the first female of color to do so. Is the country ready? What lessons can Harris\\' communications team take from women who\\'ve come before in seeking the most powerful office in America? Can they successfully manage to tame a Republican media narrative that may treat race and gender as detractors rather than strengths? Here to discuss, I\\'m now joined by Amanda Litman, co-founder and co-executive director of Run for Something, a progressive American political organization dedicated to recruiting and supporting young candidates running for down-ballot office. She was also email director for Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 presidential campaign. Thanks for being on The Excerpt, Amanda.Amanda Litman:Thank you for having me.Dana Taylor:You were a key part of Clinton\\'s team back in 2016 during her historic campaign. With Harris now the Democratic nominee, is there something bittersweet about this moment for you?Amanda Litman:There really is, and I know that we would not have presidential nominee and hopefully presidential-elect Kamala Harris without presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. She had to run and in some ways she had to lose in order to get the progress that we\\'ve made for women running for office over the last eight years. Seeing this moment and knowing how close we are, it feels like getting to avenge a wrongdoing of eight years ago.Dana Taylor:You were quoted in an Atlantic article after Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination in 2020 as saying you were devastated when Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the running, and in fact, you wrote an op-ed in Cosmopolitan titled \"Stop Lying, America: You Were Never Gonna Vote for a Woman President.\" Is America ready now, do you think?Amanda Litman:I think so, and I think we\\'ve come a long way in the last eight years. It\\'s worth situating ourselves, as Kamala likes to say, the context of all that has come before us. In 2018, we had a record number of women running for office. Some people called it the year of the woman round two. The most recent one before that had been 1992. That broke history with AOC winning in New York. Lauren Underwood being a young black woman winning a majority white district outside Chicago. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar becoming the first Muslim women to serve in Congress. Deb Haaland becoming the first indigenous woman to serve in Congress.All of that helps lay the groundwork. Then in 2020, we had I think six women running for president, each of which ran in a slightly different way, one of them being vice president now, Vice President Kamala Harris. That again expanded the models for what a woman could look like leading. On top of that, in 2022 and 2024 and the years in between, now, my organization alone has worked with boards than 1,800 young women running for local office across the country. We have seen state legislators in Nevada, and I believe Arizona become majority women. Colorado is really close.We have Saint Paul, Minnesota just earlier this year, end of last year, become the first major of American city to be run entirely by women. It\\'s an all women city council, all young women, majority women of color city council. They joked during the swearing in ceremony, it felt like Barbieland. and we\\'ve seen other women across the country run who do not model or do not look like and act like the kind of women that ran even before 2016, which means I think we have more experience voting for, working for, campaigning for, volunteering for, and also defending women who are stepping up to lead in a way that really sets us up for this moment extremely well.Dana Taylor:There\\'ve been a lot of personal attacks on Harris recently from Trump and other Republicans, from criticizing her racial identity to attacking her laugh, something Clinton also had to battle. I know it\\'s early days, but do you think she and her team are fighting these effectively so far, and if not, how would you advise her going forward?Amanda Litman:I think they\\'re doing a really good job of not even engaging with some of it. Part of it\\'s because it doesn\\'t stick to her the way that it did with Hillary Clinton. For Hillary, she had been a target of right wing oppo attacks for 25 years. They had really dedicated themselves to tearing her down and making it clear no matter what kind of woman she was, whether she was a career woman or a stay-at-home mom with her kid or whatever she decided to be, it wasn\\'t the right kind. She was never going to be right. Now, I think what the Harris campaign is doing now is not leaning away from her gender or her race, but using that as part of her story for why she cares about the issues she does and helps inform and give her credibility when she\\'s talking about things like reproductive health, like maternal mortality, like equal pay, like paid family leave. It\\'s not why she\\'s running, but it helps inform her credibility on the issues in a really meaningful way.Dana Taylor:What does the entry of Harris into the presidential race add to this national contest that wasn\\'t part of the conversation before?Amanda Litman:We get to talk about the future. I think this is one of the problems of the Biden campaign when Biden was at the top of it, was that it became either a referendum on Trump, which was backward looking, or even a referendum on Biden, which because he wasn\\'t able to be as effective of a messenger, people didn\\'t really know what he had done. He had done really good things, but he couldn\\'t sit for as many interviews. He couldn\\'t do the kinds of pop culture engagement that maybe Kamala can do. We now get to look to what a new generation of leadership looks like. Kamala Harris gets to represent the future and gets to represent hope and gets to represent excitement. Yeah, you can run a campaign that is afraid of Trump and instilling the fear of an existential threat of democracy, that can work and we\\'ve seen that work before, but it is so much more fun and so much more energizing to run a campaign based on hope and enthusiasm from what could be as opposed to what was.Dana Taylor:Unlike Clinton, Harris has already held the office. It\\'s just a heartbeat away from the presidency. Is this likely to help her overcome some of the bias out there among likely voters?Amanda Litman:I think having seen her lead in big moments, having seen her do international trips, all of that does play a part here. Similarly, when she served in the Senate, she has a strong track record of accomplishments. That\\'s not to say Hillary Clinton didn\\'t either. She absolutely did, but people weren\\'t as used to seeing a woman in that kind of role, which I think made it seem a little scarier in some ways for her.Dana Taylor:As part of Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign team, I\\'m guessing you spent a lot of time and energy trying to manage the shifting media narrative. If you were going to advise Harris\\' campaign on strategy, what might you tell them to do differently?Amanda Litman:Well, different from 2016 and different from Hillary is that Vice President Harris has always been a part of this media ecosystem. She doesn\\'t have the same antagonistic relationship with the press. Hillary absolutely did, and I don\\'t blame her for that. Again, the 25 years of people talking about her marriage and her personal life and insulting her in the media, spreading conspiracy theories around her, that made her a little hesitant to engage in a really unguarded way. I think it\\'s telling that when people talk about, \"Oh, the Hillary Clinton I know, the one that I have met is much warmer and friendlier than the one maybe that the press got to see.\"Whereas Kamala has come of age as a politician, particularly in a moment where there are always cameras around her. Usually it\\'s supporters with iPhones excited to take a picture with her as opposed to trackers trying to catch her in a bad moment. She knows how to use the internet personally, and she really can engage with the press in a way that is joyful and authentic without any fear, and that allows her to have a really different relationship with the media in a way that I think will make the difference in her campaign.Dana Taylor:The email issue that arose late in the campaign for Clinton was clearly damaging to her image. Assuming for the moment that Harris doesn\\'t face any high profile incidents like that in the run up to November, how would you advise her communications team to keep the media narrative focused on the issues versus her gender or race?Amanda Litman:Yeah. I think they are experts and professionals. I think in particular, Brian Fallon who runs her communication team, who also worked for the Hillary campaign back in 2016 is one of the best in the business. I think for her talking about the issues that are ensworned by her gender or her race as opposed to making it about her gender or her race. Everyone can see she\\'s a black woman. She\\'s a woman of South Asian descent. She is who she is. Keeping a focus on how that shapes her passion for the issues, there\\'s a reason she was the most forceful advocate for abortion access within the Biden White House. Biden couldn\\'t speak credibly on that for any number of reasons. She really can and that\\'s true across any number of issues.Dana Taylor:On the other side of the aisle this year, there was a strong female contender for the Republican presidential nomination with Nikki Haley who of course was not just female but also of South Asian heritage. She faced attacks on both counts during her campaign. What were the most impressive takeaways from the Haley campaign on how to overcome voter preconceptions and bias here?Amanda Litman:I do think it is telling that we are seeing Republican women on the other sides who engage with gender in a different way. They are not always the best advocates for women to put it lightly. In many circumstances, they tend to success for me, not for thee kind of framework to their policy approaches. But I do think she also helped warm up some Republican voters who maybe were a little hesitant to vote for a woman but they could get behind Nikki Haley, especially if they were not behind Donald Trump. I think a lot about how in many of those Republican primaries people kept voting for her even after she dropped out. Even when she was no longer campaigning, but her name was on the ballot, she kept winning some Republican primary voters. Those are voters who now that they\\'ve sort of broken the seal of voting for a woman for president might be able to do it this time around for Kamala.Dana Taylor:I want to turn to former President Barack Obama who recently endorsed Harris for President. His campaign had to confront a torrent of false and racially motivated attacks aimed at his citizenship, for example. Did we learn anything about Obama\\'s successful communication strategy there?Amanda Litman:I think you got to point to it as a tactic. He was very on the level with folks. This is a thing that the Republican Party is doing to try and make it seem like I am not one of you, but my story is the American story. We saw this in the rally in Philadelphia where Vice President Harris was introducing Tim Walz and talked about their unlikely backgrounds of both growing up middle class in Oakland, California and in the Heartland, Tim Walz grew up in Nebraska and now governs Minnesota, can rise to be two of the most powerful people in the country, the very top of our federal government. That\\'s the American story in the same way that Barack Obama was the American story. It really makes it about patriotism, not about the tactics that the GOP is using to divide us.Dana Taylor:Finally, Amanda, what do you most want our audience to know about Harris\\' historic presidential run that they might not know already?Amanda Litman:She can win this. I think it is maybe people do know that and maybe they\\'re afraid to embrace that possibility. I know I\\'ve talked with so many, especially women who had their hearts set on electing Hillary Clinton in 2016 who are afraid to get excited this time around because of that crushing disappointment after election day. This is different. We are in a different moment. We have gone through a different period in history from the Women\\'s March to the Me Too movement, to even the Barbie movie last year and the Taylor Swift and Beyonce tours that increased and embraced female joy and female power. This is a moment in history and she\\'s the right person to lead, and if we have her back, she can absolutely win and I\\'m not afraid of that. I don\\'t want folks to be afraid of hoping for a victory.Dana Taylor:Amanda, thank you so much for joining me on The Excerpt.Amanda Litman:Thanks for having me.Dana Taylor:Thanks to our senior producer Shannon Rae Green for her production assistance.

       "  'WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court will wade into the controversial topic of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender people under the age of 18, taking up a case that could be a flashpoint in the fight for LGBTQ rights.The court agreed Monday to hear the Biden administration\\'s challenge to a Tennessee\\'s ban on gender-affirming medical treatment for minors, an increasingly potent political issue that has divided lower courts and emerged as a leading front in the battle over LGBTQ issues.The case will be argued in the next term, which begins in October.It\\'s the first time the justices will weigh in on the matter, which is being fought by transgender teens and their families.The Justice Department told the Supreme Court its input was “urgently needed” to resolve whether bans are discriminatory.Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.“These laws, and the conflicting court decisions about their validity, are creating profound uncertainty for transgender adolescents and their families around the nation,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar\\xa0said in a filing.At issue is whether the bans discriminate on the basis of sex.A divided 3-judge panel of the 6th Circuit ruled Tennessee\\'s bans and a similar one in Kentucky were likely to survive a challenge and allowed them to be enforced during the litigation. Two of the three judges said the evolving issue of gender dysphoria may be better left in the hands of state legislatures.\"This is a relatively new diagnosis with ever-shifting approaches to care over the last decade or two,\" \\xa0U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton, appointed by President George W. Bush,\\xa0wrote for a 2-1 majority last year. \"Under these circumstances, it is difficult for anyone to be sure about predicting the long-term consequences of abandoning age limits of any sort for these treatments.\"Given that, Sutton wrote, judges should be \"humble and careful about announcing new substantive due process or equal protection rights.\"In April, the Supreme Court allowed Idaho to largely enforce a similar state ban while that law is being challenged but didn\\'t address the underlying constitutional questions.The ban from Tennessee is the first to fully reach the Supreme Court. \\xa0Combined with other state actions to restrict the bathrooms transgender students can use and what sports teams they can join, the laws could be a major issue in this year’s elections.More:Bathrooms to ballfields: Transgender athlete ban one of many LGBTQ fights brewing in courtsFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee,\\xa0has said\\xa0he will press Congress to pass a law banning gender-affirming care for minors and will cut federal funding for schools pushing “transgender insanity” if he returns to the White House.President Joe Biden\\xa0has boasted about steps he’s taken to strengthen the rights of “transgender and all LGBTQI+ Americans.”The Biden administration in April finalized rules clarifying that schools can\\'t discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity though put on hold a proposed change to protect transgender athletes. Nine GOP-led states along with conservative advocacy groups have sued to block the protections for transgender students.Florida and a Catholic medical group are challenging a Biden administration rule banning gender identity discrimination in health care, arguing it will force doctors to provide gender transition care.Fact checkNo, Biden didn\\'t replace Easter celebration with Transgender Day of VisibilityThe issue has gained prominence with startling speed, despite the tiny – though increasing – fraction of Americans who are transgender.Since 2022, the number of states taking steps to limit access to gender-affirming care for minors has grown from four to 25.That’s despite the fact that most major medical groups support youth access to gender-affirming care.More:Republicans lean into anti-trans messaging ahead of 2024. But will it mobilize voters?\"The widely accepted view of the professional medical community is that gender-affirming care is the appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria and that, for some adolescents, gender-affirming medical care is necessary,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical and mental health groups told the court in a filing supporting challenges to the bans.But England\\'s National Health Service has begun limiting puberty-blocking drugs for those under 16, saying there\\'s not enough evidence about long-term effects.States with bans say the treatments are too drastic and untested to be allowed for those under 18 who may not fully grasp the lifelong risks and consequences.“Tennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,” the state’s lawyers told the Supreme Court.The challenges rely in part on a\\xa0landmark Supreme Court decision from 2020\\xa0that barred workplace discrimination against\\xa0LGBTQ\\xa0employees, which held that discrimination based on a person\\'s gender identity is a form of sex discrimination.\"This Court has historically rejected efforts to uphold discriminatory laws, and without similar action here, these punitive, categorical bans on the provision of gender-affirming care will continue to wreak havoc on the lives of transgender youth and their families,\" Tara Borelli, senior counsel at Lambda Legal, said in a statement. \"We are grateful that transgender youth and their families will have their day in the highest court, and we will not stop fighting to ensure access to this life-saving, medically necessary care.\"Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said the appeals court issued a \"thoughtful and well-reasoned opinion\" when it sided against the challengers.\"I look forward to finishing the fight in the United States Supreme Court,\" Skrmetti said in a statement. \"This case will bring much-needed clarity to whether the Constitution contains special protections for gender identity.\"Despite the litigation swirling around transgender minors, the Supreme Court has largely been silent on the issue. Last year, the\\xa0high court sided with a 12-year-old transgender girl\\xa0who\\xa0was challenging a West Virginia ban on\\xa0transgender athletes joining girls sports teams, temporarily blocking the state from enforcing the prohibition. The ruling came on the court\\'s emergency docket and did not resolve the underlying questions in the case.In January, the Supreme Court\\xa0declined to decide\\xa0whether schools can bar transgender students from using a bathroom that reflects their gender identity, leaving in place a lower court ruling that allowed a transgender middle school boy in Indiana to use the boys\\' bathroom.',\n",
       "  'Women were not allowed to compete at the Olympic Games until the 1900 Paris Olympics. Now, 124 years later, female athletes will make history in the same city at the 2024 Paris Olympics.Reflecting over a century of progress, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has allocated its approximately 10,500-athlete quota spaces equally among men and women for the 2024 Paris Olympics. This milestone marks the first time in history an equal number of men and women will compete at the Olympics.“We are about to celebrate one of the most important moments in the history of women at the Olympic Games, and in sport overall,” said Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee.“We will see the results of the enormous efforts made by the Olympic movement and female trailblazers come to life,” Bach added. “This is our contribution to a more gender-equal world.”The number of medals available to male and female athletes will also be the most balanced in history following the addition of disciplines once only offered to men, such as the Canoe sprint and the 15,000-meter freestyle swim (one of Katie Ledecky’s most dominant events), at the Tokyo Games. Additionally, 28 of the 32 sports at the Paris Olympics will be fully gender equal.\\xa0However, the number of medals awarded to female athletes will still be slightly fewer than those awarded to male athletes. The 2024 Paris Olympics will include 329 medal events — 152 for women, 157 for men, and 20 for mixed-gender teams.Women competed in the Olympics for the first time at the 1900 Paris Games, where they represented just 2.2% of the field and were limited to just five events: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism and golf. Since then, female participation has steadily increased.\\xa0The 2012 London Olympics marked the first time each National Olympic Committee (NOC) sent a female athlete to the Olympics, as well as the first time women could compete in all sports with the addition of women’s boxing. Still, women comprised only 44% of the athlete field. Before the 2024 Paris Games, the Tokyo Olympics were the closest to achieving gender parity, with women making up 48% of competing athletes.',\n",
       "  'NCAA President Charlie Baker and a member of the Division I Board of Directors said Wednesday they foresee no issues with getting final approval for the proposed creation of a revenue distribution for schools and conferences based on teams’ performance in the women’s basketball tournament.The board voted Tuesday to advance the proposal, which now must go before the NCAA Board of Governors and the full Division I membership. The Board of Governors is scheduled to meet Thursday, and the membership vote would occur at January’s NCAA convention.“I’ll be shocked if this thing has any issues at all” gaining approval, Baker said during a video-conference.“I think that everyone sees this as a great opportunity to capitalize on” a new, eight-year, $920 million TV deal with ESPN that includes rights to the women’s basketball tournament “and prioritize (the proposed new distribution) as much as possible,” said Central Arkansas President Houston Davis, who chairs the Board of Directors committee that developed the proposal and is a member of the Board of Governors.Baker said the concept “was pretty high up on my list” of priorities when he became the NCAA’s president in March 2023 and “reflects the growth of the game and especially makes it possible now for schools that participate in the tournament, and do well, to benefit from that financially and be able to reinvest in their programs.“I think this is all critically important to us and to the sport generally and to women\\'s sports, since this is in some respects a premier women\\'s collegiate athletic event every year. And I think it\\'s only going to get more so going forward, which is going to be great.”Baker and Davis provided other details about the proposal, under which schools would begin earning credit for performance in the 2025 tournament and payments would begin in 2026. According to a statement Tuesday from the NCAA, the pool of money to be distributed would be $15 million in 2026, $20 million in 2027 and $25 million in 2028. After that, the pool would increase at about 2.9% annually, which the NCAA said is \"the same rate as all other Division I\" shared-revenue pools.The money would be allocated in the same way that a similar performance-based pool from the men’s basketball tournament has been distributed for years: There would be 132 units allocated each year. Each participating conference would get one unit, plus an additional unit for each win by one of its teams through to the Final Four.The unit values would vary annually, with conferences then taking their total payout from the NCAA and sharing it among their schools.The NCAA said Wednesday evening that the 2026 payouts would be based on schools\\' performance in the 2025 tournament only, and the 2027 payouts would be based on performance in 2025 and 2026. Thereafter, the payouts would be based on peformance over rolling three-year periods. (The men\\'s tournament payouts are based on rolling six-year periods.) As a result the dollar value of individual units would be greater in the first two years than they would be in later years.As for $25 million becoming the target in third year and the basis for later increases, Davis said: “We were very proud of the fact that, at 25 (million), that was going to carve out a greater percentage of available resources than we do for men’s basketball and those distributions. I think that the 25 (million) became the number of what was a possible and reasonable stretch goal for us ... to make a meaningful impact.”According to figures from NCAA audited financial statements and Division I revenue distribution plans, the annual amount of the men’s basketball tournament performance pool is equal to a little over 20% of the money from the NCAA gets each year from CBS and now-Warner Bros. Discovery for a package that includes broadcast rights to the Division I men’s basketball tournament and broad marketing rights connected to other NCAA championships. In 2024, that total was $873 million and the performance pool was set to be $171 million.In 2025, CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery are scheduled to pay $995 million.The NCAA attributes $65 million of the new ESPN deal’s average annual value of $115 million to the women’s basketball tournament.North Carolina women\\'s basketball coach Courtney Banghart, who also is president of the Women\\'s Basketball Coaches Association, told USA TODAY Sports that the creation of the tournament-performance fund would be \"a significant gender-equity victory — a big win ... that will add real dollars to athletics department budgets.\"As for the amount of money in the fund, she said: \"You want your value allocated, 1 to 1. But it\\'s hard to substantiate 1-to-1 value in this moment. ... I\\'m confident (the amount) will go up as we continue to prove our value.\"The NCAA\\'s wide-ranging contract with CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery is scheduled to run through 2032, and Baker said that the association\\'s desire to “create a separate value for the women’s basketball tournament” was a reason the association negotiated to have the new deal with ESPN also end in 2032.',\n",

       "  'Team USA had a huge gold-medal day Thursday at the 2024 Paris Olympics.Simone Biles and American teammate Suni Lee competed in the women’s gymnastics all-around final, and it led to an exhilarating finish that ended with Biles securing the gold medal and Lee earning a bronze.The Olympic swimming schedule featured four finals, including Katie Ledecky back in the pool for Team USA in the women\\'s 4x200-meter free relay. While Australia swam to gold, the U.S. women took silver – and Ledecky made Olympic history in the process. But Team USA did not leave the Olympic pool Thursday without hearing the national anthem. Kate Douglass won the women\\'s 200-meter breaststroke for her first Olympic gold medal.Fencing continued to be a successful sport at these Olympics for Team USA. After winning gold and silver, respectively, earlier this week, in women\\'s individual foil, Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs led the U.S. squad to gold in women\\'s team foil. And the day kicked off with a celebration on the water as Team USA rowers earned the first gold medal in men\\'s four since the 1960 Olympics.USA TODAY Sports has a recap of all the results from Thursday, as well as the highlights, medal count, and more.There will be a new gold medalist in women’s surfing after 2020 Tokyo Olympics winner Carissa Moore was knocked out in the quarterfinals.\\xa0Moore wasn’t able to put up any spectacular waves against France’s Johanne Defay, who had herself a remarkable round that made it difficult to defeat. Defay advances to the semifinals and will next face American Caroline Marks, the last American – woman or man – remaining in the surfing competition being held in Teahupoʻo\\xa0on the southeastern coast of the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.This will be the last competition for Moore, the decorated surfer out of Hawaii. She plans to step away from surfing and focus on starting a family. — Jordan MendozaThe U.S. will have at least one surfer in the women’s semifinals after Caroline Marks won her quarterfinal matchup against Tyler Wright of Australia. Olympic surfing is being held in Teahupoʻo\\xa0on the southeastern coast of the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.\\xa0The two surfers had solid best waves in the first half of the matchup, with Marks having just a slight lead. But in the second half, Marks was able to keep up her performance, while Wright struggled to get a spectacular wave to propel her to first. Marks won by more than two points.Marks\\' win means thre could be an American vs. American semifinal. She’ll await the winner of the quarerfinal between teammate Carissa Moore and France’s Johanne Defay. — Jordan MendozaThe American men’s 3x3 basketball team has hit a new low.The U.S. team was two points away from victory against 2020 Olympics gold winner Latvia, but the defending gold medalist went on a 6-0 run to win 21-19 and provide another devastating loss to Team USA. The U.S. team was up 19-15 with two minutes left, but Latvia completed the comeback in the next 100 seconds as Team USA missed its final four shot attempts.It was a golden chance for the team to pick up momentum as it has an uphill battle to make the knockout round. The loss keeps the U.S. as the only winless team at 0-4. In last place out of eight teams, the top six teams advance to knockout play, and Team USA will likely need to win its final three games to advance. Meanwhile, Latvia is the only undefeated team at 4-0. — Jordan MendozaPARIS – Nothing has been able to stop the United States women’s beach volleyball tandem of Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\\xa0Not the rain or lightning that filled the skies around them Thursday night at Eiffel Tower Stadium. Not the 75-minute delay at the most pivotal point in the match when they had battled back from one set down. And definitely not any of the three teams they played during pool play to open the Games.\\xa0Nuss and Kloth are now off to the Round of 16 unblemished following an eventful three-set victory over China’s Xinyi Xia and Chen Xue – a gritty, come-from-behind victory for the young Americans with LeBron James in the stands. (“King James” did indeed wait out the weather.)\\xa0After dropping the first set 21-15, the U.S. won the last two sets, 21-16, 15-12.Officials called the match temporarily at 3-2 in the third. The teams traded points to 9-9 when a Chinese error gave the Americans a 10-9 lead. Nuss put it away for the final point of the game to complete the comeback.\\xa0Kloth had 21 attack points and recorded two blocks. Nuss had 11 digs and 14 attack points.\\xa0In the first set, the Americans could not find their footing and trailed 13-8 at the first timeout. China went on another 3-1 run to up the lead. An ace to make it 18-13 sealed the set and China took it 21-15. fIn the second, Nuss started running around like a Tasmanian devil in human form and mostly refused to let the ball hit the ground. She started feeling herself with the celebrations as the U.S. raced out to a 17-12 lead and secured the set, 21-16 – but not before China cut the deficit to two. Nuss drilled an ace to thwart any threat of a Chinese comeback in the frame.The crowd began reacting with screams of “U” on the first hit, “S” on the second bump and “A” on the knock over the net.\\xa0Then the rain started to fall. Lightning struck in the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Play continued. Nuss and Kloth only became stronger with the elements.\\xa0That was until the match was postponed. But it didn’t matter. — Chris BumbacaSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – The last time Xander Schauffele teed it up in an Olympics, he won a gold medal for Team USA. But it says something about how special Thursday was that Schauffele walked of the golf course saying, “It feels like I’m here (in the Olympics) for the first time.”“For me, Tokyo was really special, obviously. But there were no fans,” said Schauffele, referencing the games of three years ago defined by COVID-19 restrictions. “The city was closed. I was stuck in my hotel room. … (This) was an awesome atmosphere.”Schauffele, fresh off major victories at The PGA Championship and The Open Championship, is enjoying a bit of a moment right now. When those happen, you can shoot a 6-under-par 65 in the opening round of the Paris Olympics – and be 5 under at the turn – and then afterward bemoan your “clanky start.”You could say that Schauffele stole the show Thursday, along with Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama (8 under), the lone player ahead of him entering Round 2. — Gentry EstesPARIS – The USA women’s beach volleyball team of Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth were in the beginning of the third set of their match against China’s Xinyi Xia and Chen Xue when severe weather forced everybody to shelter.\\xa0Leading 3-2 in the decisive game (to 15 points), officials called the match despite the players forging through rain and lightning in the distance – the lightning as the background, the Eiffel Tower being the foreground for the Thursday evening, pro-U.S. crowd.\\xa0But as the storm approached over Eiffel Tower Stadium, heavy, cold rain, along with continued lightning and booms of thunder, sent the masses scattering.\\xa0The match is expected to resume at some point but that might be a while. China took the first set, 21-15, while Nuss and Kloth stormed back in the second to take it 21-16.The start of the U.S. men\\'s 3x3 basketball match vs. Latvia was also delayed because of the storm. — Chris BumbacaThe\\xa0U.S. women\\'s basketball team\\xa0continued their road to another Olympic gold medal today against Belgium in the\\xa02024 Paris Olympic Games\\xa0group stage.

But they lost the first matchup of group play to Germany 83-69. Emma Meesseman had a game-high 25 points in the loss and\\xa0Washington Mystics\\xa0guard\\xa0Julie Vanloo\\xa0had 18 points and six assists.With America\\'s win, Team USA has clinched a spot in the quarterfinals and continue their journey to another gold.

You remember, right? He\\xa0won the 2023 U.S. Open. Earlier this year, he shot a 60 to win a shortened event at Pebble Beach. He was second at Bay Hill, tied for second at The Players.Clark has demonstrated why he deserved to be one of only four Americans who qualified for these Paris Olympics.He just hasn’t shown it lately.And that includes Thursday’s Olympics first round at Le Golf National. While most of the 60-player field took advantage of ideal scoring conditions on Day 1, Clark opened with a 4-over 75. His first three holes: bogey, double bogey, bogey. Though he stabilized from there, he closed with another double on No. 15.Clark is tied for 56th, one stroke above dead last. He\\'s one of only 13 players over par. Were there a cut in this tournament, he’d surely miss it. Unless Clark gets real hot, real fast – Pebble Beach-style – the number of Americans golfers in realistic medal contention at these Olympics is already down from four to three. — Gentry EstesFinally, a Team USA\\xa03x3 basketball\\xa0team won at the\\xa0Paris Olympics.In its fourth game in Paris, the U.S. women became the first to snap a streak of six total winless efforts between themselves and the equally floundering\\xa0men\\'s team.

The team has two more games in pool play before the knockout stage begins. And if they don’t figure it out soon, they won’t last long once that begins.\\xa0Howard finally showed some of her shooting capabilities by drilling four two-pointers on\\xa0 six attempts from deep to keep the U.S. in the game.\\xa0The Americans pulled away in the final minute to secure the all-important first win with one more game to play before the knockout round begins. — Chris BumbacaHistory in the pool: Australia wins gold in the women’s 4x200 freestyle relay.

But in many ways, his career is uniquely linked with the Olympics. – Dan WolkenPARIS — The United States is fast becoming a world power in women’s team foil, and now it has the hardware to prove it.The U.S. beat top-seeded Italy for its first-ever gold medal in the event Thursday at the Grand Palais, 45-39, capping a brilliant Olympics that also saw fencers Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs win individual gold and silver.Three years after losing to the Italians, 45-23, in a lopsided bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics, the American women were the early aggressors on their way to their second medal in women\\'s team foil\\'s 64-year Olympic history.The U.S. won silver in the event in 2008, but with less individual success than the team enjoyed this summer. Kiefer beat Scruggs in the individual final, 15-6, marking the first time the country has gone 1-2 in the sport in the Olympics. – Dave BirkettNANTERRE, France — Team USA’s Kate Douglass is officially an Olympic champion, winning the women’s 200-meter breaststroke final Thursday with a time of 2:19. 24 – a new American record.\\xa0It’s the 22-year-old two-time Olympian’s third medal overall and second at the\\xa0Paris Olympics\\xa0after winning silver in the women’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay.Douglass out-touched defending Olympic champion Tatjana Smith of South Africa, who won silver with a time of 2:19.60.

The dream still was alive with the score in the third set against Marin locked at 15-15.Alas, Zhang she noted Marin’s experience in high-stakes matches when asked about the final outcome of their badminton battle. – Josh PeterSerbia\\'s Novak Djokovic is aiming to win his second Olympic medal, but he may have to fight through an injury to get there.During his matchup with Greece\\'s Stefanos Tsitsipas, trainers took a look at Djokovic\\'s surgically repaired knee.

       "  'California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a first-of-its-kind state law Monday aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ students from having their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression revealed by schools without consent.The SAFETY Act prohibits schools from enforcing policies that forcibly out a student and shields teachers and other school staff from retaliation if they refuse to obey such policies.\\xa0The new law makes California the first state to ban outing policies, according to the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus.Chris Ward, a San Diego Democrat who first introduced the bill in the California Legislature, said in a statement Monday that the SAFETY Act combats a rise in politically motivated attacks on queer and transgender students nationwide.\\xa0\"While some school districts have adopted policies to forcibly out students, the SAFETY Act ensures that discussions about gender identity remain a private matter within the family,” Ward said. “As a parent, I urge all parents to talk to their children, listen to them, and love them unconditionally for who they are.\"The law’s enactment came nearly a year after Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction, said he was forcibly removed from a local school board meeting where he was opposing a district\\'s proposed outing policy, which was eventually blocked in court.\\xa0“Our teachers can now focus on teaching the critical academic skills that our students need to succeed, not on policing the gender identities of children,” Thurmond said in a statement Monday.\\xa0According to the progressive think tank the Movement Advancement Project, eight states, including Idaho and North Dakota, legally force the outing of transgender youth in schools.

       "  'NASHVILLE — A federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging a controversial Tennessee law that limits drag show performances in the state.The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision reversed a lower court ruling that deemed the statute an unconstitutional limitation on the freedom of expression and blocked its enforcement in part of the state. In Thursday\\'s ruling, judges declared that the Memphis-based LGBTQ+ theater company Friends of George’s, which filed the original challenge last year, lacked the legal right to sue over the law.The group claimed the law would impact their livelihoods due to the law’s overbroad language restricting artistic performances, especially considering the group’s drag-centric themes. Friends of George’s had not yet released a statement as of Thursday night.The judges took a different tone than the previous lower court ruling, instead emphasizing that the law was indeed specific enough, as the term \"harmful to minors,\" according to them, was clear enough to absolve Friends of George’s from any concerns.\"Friends of George’s has not alleged that its performances lack serious value for a 17-year-old. In fact, it insists the exact opposite. Its own witness, a member of Friends of George’s board, conceded that its shows \\'are definitely appropriate\\' for a 15-year-old and would \\'absolutely\\' have artistic value for a 17-year-old,\" the ruling stated.In a statement released Thursday afternoon, Tennessee\\xa0Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti praised the ruling.\"Tennessee’s Adult Entertainment Act has been consistently misrepresented since its adoption,\" Skrmetti wrote. \"As a state overflowing with world-class artists and musicians, Tennessee respects the right to free expression. But as the Court noted, Tennessee’s ‘harmful to minors’ standard is constitutionally sound and Tennessee can absolutely prohibit the exhibition of obscene material to children.\"The Tennessee Adult Entertainment Act (AEA), which saw heavy support from the state\\'s Republican-dominated legislature in 2023, saw equal pushback from a small portion of Democrats. Tennessee Rep. Aftyn Behn, D-Nashville and a frequent advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, released a statement on Thursday.“This ruling is absurd and flies in the face of small government principles,\" she wrote. \"It targets drag performers under the false pretense of protecting children, even though the court acknowledged that these performances are not harmful to minors.\"Federal Judge Thomas Parker, of the Western District of Tennessee, sided with Friends of George’s last June, stating the law was \"passed for the impermissible purpose of chilling constitutionally-protected speech.\"Parker noted then the impossible position performers were placed in, in trying to determine the legality of expressive performance based on vague wording.\"(The state) argues that they think (Friends of George’s) exhibits are not \\'harmful to minors\\' under the AEA,\" Parker said. \"But this would lead to (Friends of George’s) taking an enormous risk. It would have to eat the proverbial mushroom to find out whether it is poisonous.\"Two judges affirmed the Thursday decision to dismiss the case — Senior United States Circuit Court Judge Eugene Siler and Circuit Court Judge John Nalbandian, with Circuit Court Judge Andre Mathis dissenting, calling the law an \"unconstitutional content-based restriction on speech\" and explicitly stating his support of Parker’s lower court ruling.\\'We’re here to stay\\':Why drag is critical in the US and sometimes safer abroadAnti-LGBTQ+ bills have flooded statehouses across the country as lawmakers in Republican-led states have increasingly pursued conservative policies in recent years. A record number of anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced last year, according to advocacy and civil rights groups.At least 510 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in state legislatures in 2023, which is almost double the number of bills introduced in 2022, according to data from the American Civil Liberties Union. More have been introduced in 2024, with the ACLU recording nearly 530 bills introduced as of late June.The wave of anti-LGBTQ+ bills has made many states less equitableand inclusive, according to advocacy groups and recent reports. Similar to bills introduced last year, legislators have particularly targeted public education institutions and health care in 2024 by restricting access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth and regulating school curriculums.The Human Rights Campaign — the country\\'s largest gay rights organization — announced in April that since 2015, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ+ laws than any other state. The organization reported at the time that the state had enacted 21 laws compared to 13 laws enacted in both Arkansas and Florida.Some states have sought to\\xa0limit drag performances and two others, Tennessee and Montana, have already\\xa0banned drag performances. So far in 2024, the ACLU has tracked at least 27 drag bans introduced in the U.S.The drag community and drag events across the country have also faced bomb threats, backlash, cancellations, and hostile rhetoric in recent years. GLAAD, a nonprofit LGBTQ advocacy organization, said in April 2023 that it had documented over 160 incidents of anti-LGBTQ+ protests and threats targeting drag events since early 2022.The USA TODAY Network - Tennessee\\'s coverage of First Amendment issues is funded through a collaboration between the Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.Contact Angele Latham by email at alatham@gannett.com or on X at @angele_latham',\n",
       "  'The widening ideological rift today between liberals and conservatives is obvious. But the more subtle differences between different schools of thought within parties can be harder to parse.While the Republican National Convention highlights that Republicans are largely rallying behind a party platform which is a combination of different conservative ideas, each might have different, overlapping motivations and priorities.One of those ideas is social conservatism.According to the European Center for Populism Studies, “Social conservatism\\xa0is the belief that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions.”Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.“Social conservatism is generally skeptical of social change and believes in maintaining the\\xa0status quo\\xa0concerning social issues such as family life, sexual relations, and patriotism.”Social conservatism is, more simply put, conservatism on social issues. In the U.S. that might mean opposition to gay and transgender rights, abortion, immigration, civil rights and other issues that have to do with social groups and relationships.Social conservatives often support the right to carry guns and a strong, central role for religion — particularly Christianity — in society and government.Social conservatives tend to oppose steps to dismantle historical inequalities related to personal and social differences including race, class, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexuality and national origin.Historically, social conservatives have opposed racial integration, civil rights reform, women’s right to vote and the legalization of being gay, among other social reforms.They tend to oppose pluralism, which is when different cultural identity groups coexist equally, side by side in society, and instead embrace hierarchy.“Conservatives, our work shows, tend to believe more strongly than liberals in a hierarchical world, which is essentially the view that the universe is a place where the lines between categories or concepts matter,\" writes the University of Pennsylvania\\'s Jeremy Clifton.A good example of this is the conservative emphasis on the deep, “natural,” and essential difference between men and women and the importance of each filling traditional gender roles.Through much of the 20th century, social conservatism was largely concerned with maintaining racial, religious and gender distinctions in society and before the law.They might favor order, as in “law and order,” as a good thing in and of itself, over what they might see as a messier, less strictly disciplined society with more of certain individual freedoms.They call for newly enforcing what they might themselves call “old-fashioned,” values, and might want to go back to a real or imagined past.Thomas DeMichele of the fact-checking organization Fact / Myth helps illustrate one important difference between present-day mainstream conservatism from different varieties in the past:“Generally, where classical conservatism wants to maintain tradition, social conservatism wants progressive change toward what it perceives as traditional values,” that is, to make progress by going back from social change that has already happened, to an idealized past.Fiscal conservatism is one of the other major strains in American conservatism.Some of its most important and central beliefs are that taxation should be low and that the government should have a small role and weak power to intervene in the affairs of society and the economy.It has some contradictions with social conservatism, particularly the fact that social conservatism tends to want the government to have more power to enforce certain moral and social rules, but the two coexist without much conflict within the modern Republican Party.Fiscal conservatives believe that society and the economy can and should regulate themselves without oversight and that the primary role of the government is to protect private property, rather than to protect and promote the livelihood of its citizens and their ability to exercise their rights in a more direct and proactive way.',\n",
       "  \"As veteran sprinter Scout Bassett got set in her starting blocks at Saturday’s U.S Paralympics Team Trials, she knew she was down to her last chance to make the team that will compete at the Paralympic Games in Paris.\\xa0But last chances are something Bassett has some experience with.\\xa0The sprinter, who grew up in Harbor Springs, Michigan, was born in Nanjing, China. As an infant she lost her right leg in a chemical fire and spent the first eight years of her life in a government-run orphanage, where she was abused, starved and kept indoors. When she was adopted and moved to the United States, Bassett found another new home on the track when she turned 14 with the help of a grant provided by the Challenge Athletes Foundation.At the trials, she reflected on that journey.“This morning, I just woke up and I told myself that no matter what happens out here today, I've already won because I've overcome so much in my life, more than most people would ever be able to,” said Bassett.\\xa0In this particular race, Bassett did not end up where she hoped.\\xa0 Noelle Lambert and Lindi Marcusen outran Bassett, with Marcusen smashing her own American record that she set the previous night with a time of 14.87 seconds.While Bassett wanted a different result, she took pride in her performance of 16.15.“To call myself a Paralympian, to have traveled the world lifting up people with disabilities is more than I think 14-year-old Scout could have ever dreamed of and hoped for, and I'm so proud of that.”Bassett lined up on the blocks on Saturday as a Paralympic star and advocate. She finished fifth at the 2016 Games in the women’s 100 meters in her classification of T42 (a designation for athletes who have an above-the-knee amputation) and owns several world championship podium finishes.She has also led the way in bridging the gap between the Paralympics and mainstream media. Bassett stars in several prominent advertising campaigns, including Nike’s “Unlimited” spots and Proctor and Gamble’s “Gold is Good” Olympic series. \\xa0Her visibility has translated into a strong social media presence, and she has amassed more than 60,000 followers on Instagram alone.Although Bassett’s time on the track for Team USA might be ending, her impact may only be growing. One area she is particularly focused on is gender equity in the Paralympics and this year she was named president of the Women’s Sports Foundation, where she can more directly engage with that issue. Bassett said she is enthusiastic that this opportunity will continue to open doors for athletes with disabilities, especially women.“We don't have equal events for women and hopefully, in my time at Women's Sports Foundation, we can really help to change that and to show that there are many women athletes with disabilities out here competing and who deserve the same opportunities that the men have to compete.”Even though Bassett did not qualify for the 2024 Paralympics, she is happy with what she has achieved. Parasports and the fan and media attention athletes with disabilities receive is much greater than when she first began competing.“To leave a legacy where the space the sport is in a good place and you know that you're helping others to get those same opportunities. So I'm truly just grateful for that.”\",\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON – Donning his signature navy blue suit and red tie, former President Donald Trump was greeted by more than 17,000 raucous fans in Newark, N.J. at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event on June 1, just one day after he was convicted of\\xa034 counts of falsifying business records.Walking through the crowd of mostly grown men and young boys, many were screaming, recording and scrambling to shake the former president’s hand as he strutted toward the ring.Young men are one of the top demographics Trump and Republicans want to appeal to this week as the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee gets underway, as showcased by the just-released list of speakers at the convention.\\xa0One notable name on that list is UFC CEO Dana White, a longtime friend of Trump who spoke at the 2016 Republican convention and had a recorded message at the 2020 convention. He is reportedly slated to introduce the former president on Thursday.Republicans have long held leads among men in presidential elections, and the party wants to continue to make strides with young men – who are shown to have more conservative views on gender equality – throughout the election.Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.Polling shows there is a gender-divide among voters who support Democrats and those who support Republicans.\\xa0President Joe Biden leads in support among women by roughly 8 percentage points, according to an analysis from the New York Times published last month. Trump, on the other hand, holds a double-digit lead among men, the analysis found.While Gen Z and Millennials are often held as more progressive, men in those demographics are found to be less supportive of gender equality.According to an Ipsos poll published in March, 60% of Gen Z men believe that promoting women’s equality has gone so far that it discriminates against men, compared to 40% of Gen Z women who believe that.“There\\'s a new gender gap in American politics: Biden\\'s problem with men,” former Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, wrote on X, along with a link to the Times analysis.Young conservatives are praising the RNC’s decision to include speakers like UFC’s White.Alt-right conspiracy theorist and Trump supporter Jack Posobiec on Saturday lauded the RNC as “becoming a people’s convention,” and praising White for being included despite the “hypermasculine sport” MMA initially being rejected by “the establishment.”\\xa0But a video of White slapping his wife, Anne, on New Year’s Eve in 2023 quickly began recirculating on the internet by Democrats who were critical over his inclusion of the convention.The video, made public by TMZ, showed White slapping Anne in the face while they vacation in Mexico. His wife initially slapped him in the face after he tried to grab her wrist while she was walking away.At the time, White said there “are no excuses for it.”“It’s something I’m going to have to deal with and live with for the rest of my life,” he said at a press conference last year.“Unbelievably, Team Trump is boasting of their machismo, per Axios, by having Trump intro’d at convention by UFC’s Dana White seen here slapping his wife,” former Rep. Barbara Comstock, D-Va., wrote on X.Several other male conservative darlings and rising-stars will be featured at the week-long event, some of which highlight Republicans’ continued efforts to target men in the election.Tucker Calson, the former Fox News host who criticized Trump in text messages later revealed publicly, but is now on friendly terms with the former president, will speak at the convention.The organizers of the convention aren’t just highlighting longtime conservatives, but are making an effort to include more “everyday Americans” as part of the programming.\\xa0A group of fraternity members from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who went viral in May after holding up an American flag during a pro-Palestine protest, are among two-dozen people or groups who will be part of the “Everyday American Convention.\"An announcement from Trump’s campaign said the students \"gained national attention as videos of the protest showed them standing strong to protect the American flag, even as protestors antagonized them.”',\n",
       "  'The NCAA, the Power Five conferences and lawyers for the plaintiffs in three antitrust cases concerning the compensation of college athletes on Friday filed documents asking a federal judge in California to provide preliminary approval of a proposed settlement that would include a nearly $2.8 billion damages pool for current and former athletes and dramatically alter other fundamental aspects of how the association’s top level of competition is governed.Division I schools would be able to start paying athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL), subject to a per-school cap that would increase over time.NCAA leaders would seek to engineer rules changes eliminating longstanding, sport-by-sport scholarship limits and replacing them with a new set of roster-size limits. In the first academic year after final approval of the settlement the roster limit in football, for example, would be 105. Some Power Five schools recently have had rosters of more than 125 players, according to data compiled by USA TODAY Sports through open-records requests.And while athletes would continue to have the ability to make NIL deals with entities other than their schools, the settlement would allow the NCAA to institute rules designed to give the association greater enforcement oversight of those arrangements. The NCAA also would be allowed to have rules requiring athletes to make progress toward a degree in order to receive the payments proposed under the settlement.The settlement does not address an array of other legal issues the NCAA is facing, including the prospect of athletes being deemed employees of their schools.The NCAA would fund the damages pool over a 10-year period, with more than half of the money coming from reductions in the NCAA’s distributions to all Division I schools and conferences. Nearly 400,000 athletes would be eligible for some type of payment for damages reaching as far back as 2016, with football and men’s basketball players set to receive the largest amounts. But the plaintiffs’ lawyers said there is an instance of an athlete in sport other than football, men’s basketball or women’s basketball who is estimated to be eligible for a claim of more than $1.85 million.Multiple people have told USA TODAY Sports they expect that the proposed arrangement will have a future impact of at least $20 million a year on the budgets of athletics departments that will pay their athletes the maximum combined total that would be allowed under the cap.Altogether, the plaintiffs’ lawyers say, the damages and the future payments from schools for NIL will provide athletes with a combined total of more than $20 billion over the 10 years that would be covered by the proposed agreement.This makes the deal “one of the largest antitrust class-action settlements in history,” the plaintiffs\\' lawyers said in their summary of the proposal.In their filing with the court, they wrote that this is a \"revolutionary settlement agreement ... that will have a profoundly positive impact on the tens of thousands of college athletes at the hundreds of colleges and universities that play Division I sports each year. ... This is nothing short of a seismic change to college sports following more than four years of hard-fought victories in\" the cases.The proposed nearly $2.8 billion settlement pool would include money that would go to the plaintiffs\\' lawyers for their fees and costs. According to documents filed Friday, they will ask the judge to approve up to $495.2 million in fees, just under 18% of the total, plus \"out-of-pocket expenses.\" The plaintiffs\\' legal team is led by Steve Berman of Seattle-based Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, and Jeff Kessler of New York-based Winston & Strawn LLP. This amount, like others in the case, would be paid out over 10 years, the documents said.If U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken accepts the arrangements as presented, this new model of college sports could take effect as early as the 2025-26 school year, and current and former athletes could begin receiving checks from the damages pool in fall 2025.But as part of the approval process, athletes — presumably represented by other attorneys — will have the opportunity to object. The process likely will take months to complete. And it could take much longer. If the settlement is approved, in the future, incoming college athletes will receive notice of the settlement terms and have the right to file written objections, Friday\\'s filings said.Here is a look at the proposed settlement, according to summary information provided by the plaintiffs’ lawyers, the NCAA and the documents:This money seeks to compensate former and current athletes for varying impacts of NCAA rules that have limited athlete compensation. But the three lawsuits were filed at different times and cover different issues. That means money would be paid out from a variety of pools and amounts will depend on a variety of factors, including the sport an athlete played, the conference in which they played and the number of years they played that are covered by the proposed settlement.For example, there would be a pool based on television broadcast money that allegedly would have gone to Power Five athletes if the NCAA’s limits on pay had not existed. That pool likely would cover athletes in football, men’s basketball and women’s basketball and would cover athletes from as far back as 2016, because\\xa0the applicable lawsuit\\xa0was filed in 2020. The date is four years prior to when the suit was initially filed because that is the reach-back period allowed under antitrust law.According to the plaintiffs’ lawyers, these payments for football and men’s basketball players would average about $91,000 and range from $15,000 to $280,000. Because there are fewer men’s basketball players than there are football players, men’s basketball players on average will receive more money, according to the plaintiffs’ lawyers. For women’s basketball players, the average would be $23,000 and would range from $3,000 to $52,000.Another pool would be based on the value of NIL opportunities that athletes now have but that had been prohibited by the NCAA until July 1, 2021. That pool would cover all current and former athletes who competed on any Division I team prior to July 1, 2021, and received NIL pay after that date. That pool is the source of the single estimated claim of more than $1.85 million.Damages amounts also would be available based on use of athletes’ NIL in video games; pay for play opportunities they allegedly lost because of NCAA rules; and academic achievement awards that athletes now can get but previously could not. The academic achievement damages pool is likely to cover all current and former athletes who competed on a Division I team on, or after, April 1, 2019, because\\xa0the applicable suit\\xa0was filed in April 2023.It’s likely that some athletes would be eligible for payments from multiple pools.The various sport-by-sport damages amounts connected to TV broadcast money are driven by plaintiffs’ expert reports and could be important as schools contemplate how to allocate the NIL money that the settlement would allow them to pay athletes – particularly in the context of Title IX, the federal gender-equity law.The reports came from Ed Desser, a media consultant, and\\xa0Dan Rascher, a University of San Francisco sport management professor who also has been an expert witness on the economics of major-college athletics for plaintiffs in other\\xa0antitrust cases against the NCAA. And they were referenced in a filing by the NCAA in April 2023 that was part of its effort to oppose the case.According to that filing:►Desser concluded that\\xa0value of the use of athletes\\' NIL in college sports TV contracts\\xa0is 10% of the total broadcast revenue for each conference.►Desser also determined that\\xa0of the dollar amount connected to that percentage\\xa0in a multisport media deal, 75% can be attributed to football, 15% to men\\'s basketball and 5% to women\\'s basketball and 5% to Olympic sports.This could inform how schools seek to budget their NIL pay to athletes. However, because the money would be coming from the schools, rather than outside entities, Title IX advocates will be watching these allocations closely.Schools would have latitude about how much to pay an individual athlete, but there would be a limit on the total amount they could initially pay to their athletes. Initially, that would be an amount equal to 22% of the average total of eight types of annual operating revenues that Power Five conference schools annually report to the NCAA. Among those revenue sources are ticket sales, appearance guarantees, media rights and sponsorship fees, revenue shares from conferences and the NCAA, and money from bowl games.The amount of the cap would increase annually and an official for the NCAA said the percentage would be subject to review at least every three years.Rascher estimates that the maximum amount per school would start at more than $20 million for the 2025-26 school year and grow to $32.9 million in 2034-35, Friday\\'s filings said.There would be an attempt to bring this under some enforceable regulation, the official for the NCAA said. Athletes would have to report payments of more than $600 to a clearinghouse that would be established. And their deals would be subject to review, with the goal being the prevention of pay for play and deals that pay amounts above market value.Athletes who have questions about the permissibility of their agreements would be able to seek advisory opinion from an enforcement group. If the enforcement group sought to sanction an athlete because of a deal, the athlete would have the ability to bring the matter to an arbitrator.The plaintiffs’ lawyers said in their summary that the scholarship limits “restricted benefits that could be provided to athletes.” Using roster limits instead, “puts the NCAA in line with most professional sports leagues, which have roster limits.”In the Football Bowl Subdivision, the annual scholarship limit has been 85. But during the 2022 season, public schools then in the Southeastern and Big Ten conferences, on average, had 126 football players, according to data included in the most recently available versions of their annual financial reports to the NCAA; USA TODAY Sports compiled those reports through open-records requests. Under the settlement, while the roster would be down to 105 players, all of them would be eligible for scholarships and they could be awarded partial scholarships if their school so chose.At present, in FBS football and five other Division I sports, even if an athlete receives only a partial scholarship, it counts as one full scholarship against the limit of 85. The settlement would do away with that construct.The official for the NCAA said that because the association has faced — and continues to face — many antitrust lawsuits, it wants this settlement to at least head off a future attempt to challenge its scholarship limits. In addition, the elimination of scholarship limits, at least theoretically, would provide schools the opportunity to give more athletic scholarship money to a greater number of athletes.A preliminary approval hearing has been tentatively set for Sept. 5, but it could be held sooner.Over the past 15 years of antitrust litigation involving the NCAA, there have been other damages settlements that Wilken has approved with only minor adjustments. However, in one of those cases, one former college football player and his attorney pursued an objection to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel unanimously rejected their arguments, but the dispute resulted in it taking a little more than two years for that settlement to go from where the proposed deal in these cases now stands.At present, there is already\\xa0another ongoing antitrust suit against the NCAA\\xa0and the power conferences regarding athlete compensation that has the potential to be a source of objections to the proposed settlement. That case is proceeding in a U.S. District Court in Colorado.On Tuesday, lawyers for the plaintiffs in that case filed an amended version of their lawsuit that added three athlete plaintiffs, increasing the total to five, and made some new allegations that criticize the proposed settlement in California.\\xa0\\xa0The new version of the suit in Colorado alleges that “even if that settlement is approved, it would simply usher is a new, artificially low cap that is far below the revenue sharing that a competitive market would yield. While it is an admission that amateurism is not needed, it also simply substitutes one illegal price fix for another.”Houston Christian University,\\xa0a member of the Football Championship Subdivision,\\xa0had attempted to intervene in the case\\xa0and had asked Wilken to declare the proposed agreement to be \"void and of no effect.\" On Wednesday, however, she denied that request and blocked Houston Christian (HCU) from objecting to the proposed settlement.In its motion to intervene, HCU alleged: “The proposed settlement will adversely affect HCU. None of the parties, particularly the Defendants, has consulted with — much less taken any step to protect — HCU’s interests. Neither HCU nor its conference were parties to this litigation, had a seat at the negotiating table, or had any input into any resolution of this matter, including the proposed settlement.”Following Wilken’s ruling on Wednesday, James Bryant, an attorney for HCU said: \"I respect the judge\\'s decision. She has worked very hard on this case. But I disagree with (the ruling). And I suspect there will be an appeal or further litigation in another forum.\"',\n",
       "  'Across America, including in conservative states like Nebraska and Arkansas, every proposed ballot measure to restore or expand abortion access gathered enough signatures to make November\\'s ballot. Voters in 11 states this fall could vote on abortion, if those signatures are certified and the measures survive legal challenges.For 50 years, the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s Roe v. Wade decision gave women in America access to abortion until fetal viability, around the 24th week of pregnancy. The Dobbs decision in 2022 overturned those national protections for abortion, and states adopted a range of policies, from near total bans to broad access in line with the Roe standard.In states that allow voter-driven ballot measures, abortion rights groups have used the tool to push back against restrictions. In past elections, voters even in conservative states like Ohio and Kansas have shown a willingness to support these abortion ballot measures.Now, abortion could become an even more high-profile issue come November. Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has been a forceful advocate for abortion access and will likely make the issue central in her campaign against Republican Donald Trump.\"I\\'ve been doing this work for a long time, and I\\'ve never felt the kind of energy and enthusiasm that we currently have with Americans across the county,\" said Caroline Mello Roberson of Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion rights advocacy group that campaigned for ballot measures campaigns in Arizona, Nevada and Michigan.Sign-up for Your Vote:Text with the USA TODAY elections team.In Arizona, where the state Supreme Court\\'s reinstatement of a strict, 19th century anti-abortion law made national news, organizers of a measure to allow abortions until fetal viability this month submitted 800,000 signatures, or around 20% of the state\\'s eligible voters.\"A very broad majority supports this issue, and that\\'s whether we were in rural communities or cities, whether we were in largely red, conservative districts or more progressive areas of the state,\" said Dawn Penich, a spokesperson for the Arizona organizers.Voter-initiated ballot measures have already been approved for the November ballot in Colorado, Florida, Nevada and South Dakota. In Maryland and New York, legislators have put forward ballots measures that add abortion-related protections to the state constitutions.The signatures submitted in Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, Montana and Nebraska still need to be certified by the states before the measures appear on the November ballot. Any of these measures could also be challenged in court.New York\\'s proposed constitutional amendment extending abortion rights, for example, was pulled from the ballot by a state judge in May before being restored by higher courts.And some abortion access efforts in conservative states may also face opposition from state officials.In deep red Arkansas, where abortion currently is allowed only to save the life of a mother, organizers of a ballot measure to restore broader access submitted more than 100,000 signatures. A week later, the Republican secretary or state rejected those signatures on a technicality. The ballot measure organizers are challenging that decision in court.Meanwhile, some of the abortion rights groups have complained their ballot measures have been intentionally mischaracterized by their opponents. In some cases, the opposition have used underhanded tactics.In Nebraska, signers were confused by two similarly named ballot initiatives, one seeking to expand abortion rights, and the other aiming to restrict them. Organizers for Protect Our Rights, the reproductive rights advocacy campaign, said they heard voters were deceived into signing the opposing Protect Women and Children petition.According to the Nebraska Examiner, more than 300 people submitted affidavits with the Secretary of State\\'s Office to get their names off Protect Women and Children\\'s petition, while 12 did the same for the Protect Our Rights initiative.Creating opposing ballot measures is a common tactic used by opposition groups to confuse voters about what ballot initiatives aim to do, according to Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a group that supports progressive ballot initiatives. \\xa0“Because of how widely successful reproductive freedom ballot measures have been, we are seeing this as a tactic used to confuse and intimidate voters at the ballot,” she said.In Arkansas, an email went out to supporters of the abortion ballot measures on July 4, a day before the signature deadline, saying the organizers had reached their goal and volunteers should take the day off and celebrate. The organizers say their email list was stolen, and they believe the unauthorized message was sent to discourage the final push to gather signatures.The conservative Arkansas Family Council also published the names of paid canvassers and the towns where they were working. The ballot organizers characterized the publication as doxxing and an attempt to intimidate the canvassers, while the Arkansas Family Council countered that posting the publicly available information promoted election transparency.\"There\\'s no secret that ballot measures have been a problem. That\\'s because pro-lifers have been outspent,\" said Kelsey Pritchard of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which campainged against abortion measures in conservative states like Arizona, South Dakota and Florida.Since the Dobbs decision, Pritchard said, many Republican politicians have shied away from embracing an anti-abortion position.Ballot measures isolate issues, and remove them from the extreme partisanship of American politics today, said Fields Figueredo. Voters are more willing, she believes, to cross party lines to support an issue like abortion when it is separated from a political candidate.\"People are reading the ballot measure from the perspective of how this is going to impact themselves and their community,\" she said.Here is where proposed abortion ballot measures stand across the country:Arizona made national news in April when the state\\'s Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law that imposed a near total ban on abortion. The legislature later overturned that Civil War-era law. Abortion rights organizers collected more than 800,000 signatures, double the amount needed, for a constitutional amendment that would create a right to abortion up until the fetus becomes viable.Despite no support from national abortion rights groups, organizers gathered more 100,000 signatures for a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow unrestricted abortions in the first 18-weeks after fertilization with exceptions later in the pregnancy for rape, incest and the mother\\'s health. The Arkansas Secretary of State rejected the submitted signature due to a missing form, but the organizers filed suit to challenge that decision. Current Arkansas law allows abortion only to save the mother\\'s life, and no abortions were performed in the state last year.Colorado already has extensive protections for abortion, including laws shielding doctors who perform abortions on patients from out of state. But a ballot initiative led by reproductive rights supporters would enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution. The initiative would also bar the government from prohibiting the coverage of abortions through health insurance plans, including for public employees and for publicly funded health care plans. An opposing initiative aimed at banning abortion failed to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot.In May, Florida banned almost all abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Before that law went into effect, the state had some of the least restrictive abortion laws in the Southeast, and more than 7,000 women traveled to the state from across the region for the procedure. A voter-driven measure already approved for the November ballot, however, would restore abortion access up to fetal viability. The measure must be approved by 60% of the voters to pass.A ballot measure, proposed by the state legislature, would enshrine abortion protections in the state\\'s constitution. Current state laws, enacted by a voter-driven ballot initiate in 1991, provide broad access to abortion.Reproductive rights supporters in Missouri are attempting to scale back the state’s near total abortion ban through a ballot initiative that would enshrine the right to the procedure in the state\\'s constitution. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, a coalition of abortion rights activists, submitted more than 380,000 signatures in May, which local election officials have until July 30 to certify. The group has faced challenges from anti-abortion groups, which have led an aggressive “Decline to Sign” campaign.Abortion rights proponents in Montana recently submitted 117,000 signatures, nearly double the required amount, for a ballot initiative that would enshrine the right to abortion in the Montana Constitution. Currently, abortion is legal in the state up to fetal viability. The campaign had less than 80 days to collect signatures after Attorney General Austin Knudsen challenged the initiative in court, narrowing the signature collection window.Two opposing ballot initiatives submitted signatures: one aiming to enshrine the state\\'s current 12 week abortion ban in the Nebraska Constitution, and the other seeking to extend abortion access up to fetal viability. Protect Our Rights, the group supporting abortion access in the state, broke a record for the number of signatures submitted for a ballot initiative in Nebraska with around 207,000. Protect Women and Children, the anti-abortion campaign, came in close with 205,000 signatures in only 97 days. If both initiatives make it on the ballot, the one that receives the most votes in November will pass.In June, a ballot initiative enshrining abortion rights in the Nevada Constitution got the green light for the November ballot after receiving more than 200,000 signatures. Nevada currently has a 1990 law in place allowing abortions for the first 24 weeks of pregnancy or later to protect the health of the pregnant person. The proposed amendment would enshrine this access in the state constitution. Voters would have to approve the initiative in both 2024 and 2026 to amend the state constitution.The Equal Rights Amendment, a constitutional amendment put forward by state lawmakers, would bar discrimination against a woman who had an abortion. New York allows abortions through the 24th week of pregnancy. The amendment would also bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity and national origin.South Dakotans will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this November after a ballot initiative aiming to do so was approved in May. Along with scaling back the state’s near total abortion ban, the initiative would allow for abortions in the first trimester while also allowing the state, in the second trimester, to “regulate the pregnant woman’s abortion decision and its effectuation only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.” The amendment would also create an exemption for abortions to “preserve the life and health” of the woman in the third trimester.Contributing: George Fabe Russell',\n",

       "  'The House of Representatives recently passed a bill that would automatically register men ages 18 to 25 for the Selective Service, the vehicle for conscripting soldiers if the draft were ever reinstated. The Senate Armed Forces Committee then passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would call for women to register for the draft.While the United States has not had a draft since 1973, the military faces significant recruitment challenges, which has revived the debate about whether compulsory service is once again necessary.The Selective Service System requires men ages 18 to 25 to register. However, women have been excluded from the requirement because until 2013 they were not allowed to fill combat roles. But the last restrictions on women in combat were lifted in 2016.The Senate version of the NDAA, if signed into law, would be a culmination of these changing views, recognizing that women are equally capable and willing to serve their country in various capacities. The legislative change aligns with the military\\'s ongoing efforts to promote gender equality within its ranks.The legislation also comes at a time when military service isn’t the most desirable employment opportunity for Americans. Recruitment numbers have declined in recent years, influenced by factors that include a robust job market, changing societal values and concerns over military lifestyle and safety.The decline in recruitment numbers shows that new, innovative approaches are needed to attract young Americans to serve in the armed forces.“My great-grandfather was drafted into three battles during the American Revolution, as a prior enslaved, free Black man in 1777,\" said Brandi Jones, a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and an active-duty Marine Corps spouse. “I have a daughter, she’s been a military child her entire life. She has already sacrificed so much for our nation and I am proud of that.\"Honor sacrifices of military families:Military life pulls fathers away from kids, even at the moment of their birth\"Now that she’s an adult,\" Jones said, \"I want her to have the freedom to decide whether she wants to become a service member.”With low unemployment, easier access to higher education and job training programs, and few overt threats to national security, the benefits of military service aren\\'t as enticing as they used to be. This means the military will need to improve its pay and benefits to increase recruitment.For example, expanding and promoting the educational opportunities provided by the military, such as the GI Bill, can be a powerful lure. Enhanced scholarships, student loan forgiveness, more partnerships with higher education institutions and more comprehensive work credits also can attract recruits seeking educational advancement.It\\'s also a fact that many military members are grossly underpaid. Making compensation more competitive with civilian careers is crucial.So, too, are comprehensive benefits packages, including better health care, housing and retirement plans. More professional development opportunities within the military can appeal to those seeking long-term career growth.Another essential step involves creating a more inclusive and supportive environment. The military needs to address systemic issues of discrimination and its history of toxic patriarchal culture. Sustained initiatives to promote well-being, diversity and inclusivity will help foster a thriving military culture.What about military children?Republicans\\' attack on IVF is an attack on family values.Promoting the sense of community and identity that comes with military service also can be a powerful motivator for new recruits. Many people join the military to find a sense of belonging, purpose and the opportunity to be part of something larger than themselves.Requiring women to register for the Selective Service would be a significant step toward gender equality in national defense. However, it also raises critical questions about the role of women in the military and the ethics of Selective Service in general.The military\\'s strength lies in its all-volunteer force, where men and women willingly choose to serve. Compulsory service could lead to a less motivated and less cohesive military, which would endanger national security.The better approach is to make military service a more attractive option for women and men who freely choose to enlist.Marla Bautista is a military fellow columnist for USA TODAY Opinion.',\n",

       "  \"It is possible to be fans of, or at least appreciate, more than one female athlete at a time.You can think Caitlin Clark is the greatest thing to happen to women’s basketball and still be impressed with what Angel Reese brings to the game. You can want the women who laid the foundation for what the WNBA is now to get the credit they deserve and still recognize Clark is fueling unprecedented growth and attention for both the league and women’s sports.Contrary to what society has conditioned you to believe, multiple women can have success at the same time and in the same space without it becoming a Hunger Games situation. They do not have to be pitted against each other, only one able to emerge deserving of the general public’s respect and admiration.Not that you’d know this from the six weeks of the WNBA season. Or the last two years, really.While acknowledging there also are troubling undercurrents of racism and homophobia involved, some of the discourse these days resembles “Mean Girls: WNBA edition.” The veterans hate Clark. Reese is jealous of her. No one is showing Clark, or the women who came before her, the proper gratitude.For some fans, and some in the media who really ought to know better, it isn’t enough to root for someone. You have to root against her rivals at the same time. And not just root against. Denigrate and diminish so they don’t steal anyone else’s shine.“This isn’t specific to sport, which I think is important to acknowledge. It’s such a common theme and common narrative throughout different industries and different timepoints, which means it’s larger than, `Oh, these two athletes are popular now,’” said Cheryl Cooky, a professor at Purdue University who studies the intersection of gender, sport and culture.“This really is about maintaining patriarchal institutions and structures. It’s about our cultural anxieties about women. And women in powerful and successful positions,” Cooky said. “There’s also this sense of, `We can allow one. We have in our culture and patriarchal society space for one.’ If we have space for just one, she becomes the exception to the rule. It’s not perceived as a threat.“But it's not just this one. It’s all these women that are powerful and successful and posing that sort of threat to the status quo.”Sadly, this is not new. Practically from birth, girls and women are compared to one another in ways that require knocking others down to lift someone up. Who’s the prettiest? Who has the best clothes? Who’s part of the `in’ crowd?It’s bad enough when we women engage in it ourselves. It’s far worse when we give permission for others to do it, too. Which is what we’re doing by giving these nonsensical narratives air and allowing a transformative time in women’s sports to be reduced to a soap opera.Again, racism and homophobia are factors and it’s disingenuous to pretend they’re not. The dog whistles are being heard loud and clear in some of the most popular narratives. Like this notion that Clark has to be “protected” in a league where the majority of players are Black and a good number are queer. Or the demand that Clark’s contributions to the WNBA’s growth get primacy over the league’s long history of advocating for social justice and equality.But so much of this is also simply what we do to women.Go back to the days of Serena vs. Sharapova. Or the unseemly fascination with Anna Kournikova. We’ve reduced women to one-dimensional characters for so long, we don’t know how to treat women's sports, and the athletes who play them, normally.We don't know how to treat them like we do men.The WNBA is a physical league. The women who play in it are fierce competitors. They are playing, and behaving, like any other elite athletes. Yet it’s not enough to simply debate and discuss the sport, as we do with men’s sports, because we’ve never done that.It has to be a blood sport, with a winner and a loser. And I don’t mean on the scoreboard.“It’s part of a larger pattern,” Cooky said. “The legacy sports news media does not know how to cover women’s sports and doesn’t know how to do so without relying on these conventional, misogynistic tropes or narratives.”And that, in turn, keeps women in their place: Out of the conversations they deserve and out of the spotlight they’ve earned.“You’ve got to dig deep to find out what’s actually going on in the WNBA right now,” Cooky said. “So for the average fan, it allows them permission to dismiss the league. `If they can’t get their (stuff) together, why should I care about this sport?’ It gives the average fan, the average male fan, permission to not care without then being labeled sexist or misogynist. `They’re hating on women athletes, too! They’ve got their own drama so it’s not me!’ \\xa0Clark’s Fever and Reese’s Sky play again Sunday, their third meeting of the season, and I have no faith the storylines from the game will be any more enlightened, or any more informed, than those from their previous meetings.People are so dug in on their positions they can’t see they’re doing everyone a disservice.

And how worried should you be about jellyfish at the beach this summer?♦Can President Joe Biden survive the election? After a disastrous performance in the first debate of this year\\'s race, many Democratic strategists, officeholders, donors, pundits, potential rivals, and longtime friends still aren\\'t sure. A drumbeat of concern about Biden as the party\\'s nominee began minutes after Thursday\\'s debate showing a hoarse and sometimes stumbling Biden facing a bombastic Donald Trump throwing insults and untruths. Since then, efforts by Team Biden to shore up his support and move on have not quieted alarm about his prospects this fall and the damaging impact it could have on Democratic candidates down the ballot.The weekend shows and headlines focused on the issue. Former Democratic National Chair Donna Brazile said on ABC\\'s this week that she has fielded so many frantic calls from fellow Democrats that she considered dropping her phone into the Potomac. Though she said, \"He also is a good man, a strong president, and Democrats still believe that this race is winnable.\"Still a CBS News YouGov poll taken Friday and Saturday showed 72% of registered voters said Biden did not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. The same percentage said he shouldn\\'t be running for president, including 36% of Democrats. And the New York Times editorial board Friday called on Biden to drop out of the race.As for Biden\\'s most ardent supporters and donors, his performance was excruciating. Betty Cotton of New York, who has donated thousands to Biden\\'s reelection campaign and serves as a regional finance committee member said it was hard to watch. One former Obama administration official who served on Obama\\'s reelection committee and has raised funds for Biden said they woke up to multiple text chains of current donors and former administration officials, both of Obama, Biden and Biden-Harris all freaking out.Biden has insisted that he will continue his campaign, but there are complications if he doesn\\'t. This year Biden had no serious primary challenger. That means almost all of the more than 4,600 delegates expected at the Democratic convention in Chicago in August are pledged to him. Though that commitment is not binding. It also means there is no ready alternative. Raising the possibility of a brutal floor fight. Vice President Kamala Harris would be a leading alternative, but her position as Biden\\'s running mate gives her no special standing to claim the nomination.There are also rising Democrats who might have run for the nomination this time if Biden had not. They include Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and JB Pritzker of Illinois. Worried Biden donors have floated some of those names in recent days as well. For more this week and beyond stay with usatoday.com and The Excerpt.♦Black voters could be the deciding factor in this presidential election. But both sides have made significant gaffes in their appeals. What does each candidate need to do to win them over? My colleague Sara Ganim sat down with USA TODAY chief political correspondent, Phillip M. Bailey, to discuss.Sara Ganim:Philip, thanks so much for being back on the show.Phillip M. Bailey:Hey, Sara, how are you?Sara Ganim:Okay, so let\\'s jump right in. For a while, we\\'ve been hearing that Trump is doing better with Black voters. What do the numbers show?Phillip M. Bailey:Well, look, this is the important nuance to remember here. President Trump in our exclusive poll here at USA TODAY along with Suffolk University, looking exclusively at Black voters in Pennsylvania and in Michigan, two important swing states, shows that overwhelmingly African American voters are sticking with President Biden as their first and often their second choice. But here\\'s why the nuance of this is so important.Donald Trump doesn\\'t have to win a majority of the Black vote or even a substantial portion. He just has to deprive Biden of enough votes to hurt him in key spots. That\\'s because Sara, that Biden beat Trump by 92 to 7 margin among Black voters in 2020. So in order to maintain that same level of support, President Biden must get 13 new Black voters for every vote he loses to his Republican rival.Here\\'s what\\'s interesting though. There is a substantial percentage of African American voters who are saying they\\'re going to pull the lever for Donald Trump in these two swing states, particularly when we look at the gender divide. For example, in Pennsylvania, our poll shows that 6% of Black women are supporting Donald Trump compared to 16% of Black men, even better for Donald Trump in the state of Michigan. But we see that about 9% of Black women who responded to our poll said they will cast a ballot for Trump versus 22% of Black men who said the same.Sara Ganim:After the debate on Thursday, I heard a lot of chatter about Trump\\'s language around Black issues, specifically when he referred to \"Black jobs\". What are your sources saying about his rhetoric and how that plays into this?Phillip M. Bailey:Well, look, I think if you\\'re a mainstream Democrat who is always in the bag for Joe Biden, voted for him in 2020, voted for Barack Obama, voted for Hillary Clinton, you are going to take great offense to what Donald Trump said referring to as Black jobs. Many might say, \"Well, he really meant to say Black people\\'s jobs are the jobs that African Americans predominantly have.\"But look, that long string of controversies and gaffes and racist comments by the former president anger African Americans. His numbers and popularity in the African American community, again overall are in the tank. But what\\'s happening though is that there is a contingency, a segment of the African American population that\\'s certainly more vocal in this election cycle that will say things like they\\'re both racist. Voters will say to me, \"Well, look, but Joe Biden was the one who pushed the 1994 crime bill when he was a US senator from Delaware.\" Joe Biden has since apologized for his role in that legislation, but still.And one key player, I think a very important surrogate for the Trump campaign is former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, and he said, \"White people being racist is not a big issue for me. My life doesn\\'t change because somebody white said something racist.\"So I think what we\\'re seeing here, Sara, is that when we talk about the African American voter that Donald Trump is going after, it\\'s not just working class. It\\'s not just African American men and urban centers. It\\'s also this sort of rising pessimism among African Americans, particularly those who feel the economic anxiety, who feel trepidation or issue with illegal immigration. That\\'s what Kwame Kilpatrick is talking about in Detroit, and that barbershop style delivery can be very effective for the former mayor to be articulating in that swing state.Sara Ganim:Yeah, so the economy is the concern, and that\\'s what it boils down to. Character doesn\\'t really matter?Phillip M. Bailey:I think for a segment of those voters, they will simply say, \"Well, that equalizes it out.\" African American Republicans and conservatives, the statistics show do consider race, do consider their heritage to be important part of their thinking, but they are often much more individualistic. Again, I think these issues, how they play out to people and what issues matter to you most does determine who you vote for.Sara Ganim:Okay, last question. Just to put a pin on it, could this small number of Black voters who are changing their minds about Trump make enough of a difference to win him the election?Phillip M. Bailey:Absolutely. In these swing states, and considering how close this election is between these two men, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the same way in which Donald Trump\\'s conviction on those 34 felony counts in that Manhattan courtroom is upsetting up and making a lot of independent voters think twice about his character. A lot of voters I spoke to, young African American voters in particular who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 saying they\\'re going to vote for Donald Trump in 2024, said, \"I don\\'t see any improvements in my neighborhoods. I\\'m not seeing the windfalls of this. I\\'m experiencing racism anyway.\" So at least back when Donald Trump was president, in their minds, they feel like, \"Hey, I was doing better economically.\" So that nostalgia is certainly at play here. In a swing state like a Michigan or in a Pennsylvania or a Wisconsin, that absolutely can play a role.Sara Ganim:Philip Bailey is USA TODAY\\'s chief political correspondent. Thank you so much, Philip.Phillip M. Bailey:See ya soon.♦Taylor Wilson:Beryl, the first hurricane of the 2024 season intensified yesterday into a Category 4 storm with threatening winds as it moved toward the Caribbean. Tropical storm watches were posted for Dominica and southern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A tropical storm warning was also issued for Martinique and Trinidad.As Beryl strengthens it\\'s setting several records according to Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University, including that Beryl is now the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record. It\\'s too soon to determine the path and strength of Beryl when the storm gets to the western half of the Caribbean later this week, and whether it could impact the US Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane Center expects Beryl to remain a hurricane as it reaches Mexico\\'s Yucatan Peninsula on Friday.

Sara Ganim spoke with USA TODAY national correspondent, Elizabeth Weise for more.Sara Ganim:I\\'ll start by saying thank you Elizabeth, for being with us.Elizabeth Weise:I\\'m happy to be here, and I have really bad news for you. I got to say, I did this story and by the time I\\'d finished talking to all the experts, I was like, \"Dear heavens. I am never going in the ocean again.\"Sara Ganim:I mean, when I think of summer, I think of a lot of things. I don\\'t think jellyfish is the first to come to mind, but you\\'re saying that might be all we\\'re talking about this summer. Tell me more.Elizabeth Weise:So here\\'s the deal. The genesis of this story is that about 25 years ago, there was this kind of fear amongst scientists that because of climate change and pollution and ocean warming, basically all the fish would die and they\\'d just be full of jellyfish. It would just be jellyfish goo. So we\\'re like, do they think that\\'s in fact what\\'s happening?So the good news is it\\'s not. But the bad news is that a lot of the really nasty jellyfish, they\\'re moving into our territory. So we\\'re used to seeing moon jellies, which are kind of little. They\\'re pretty, and they sting a little tiny bit, but they\\'re no big deal. But like box jellyfish, which are nasty, nasty and are painful stings are starting to show up. They\\'re in Florida and they\\'ve been seen as far north as New Jersey.Sara Ganim:Oh. What\\'s causing this?Elizabeth Weise:So it\\'s a bunch of things. The oceans are warmer. So jellyfish that existed in certain places are able to exist in new places. In some areas it\\'s because of overfishing, because basically once the fish are gone, the jellyfish don\\'t have competition. And so they can take over an area where there used to be fish because fish eat jellyfish.And then another thing is it\\'s hardly enough agricultural runoff. So if you put too much fertilizer in your fields, which farmers do a lot, it sloughs off and ends up in waterways, it ends up in the ocean. You get blooms of algae, which leads to hypoxia, which is lower oxygen levels in the water. And it turns out that, and you\\'re not supposed to say this, but sometimes marine biologists will say, \"Yeah, jellyfish, they\\'re the cockroaches of the sea. They\\'ll survive anything. They don\\'t need a lot of food. They don\\'t need a lot of oxygen. Everything else can die off, and the jellyfish persist.\"So all of those reasons, and as more people move to the coasts, we\\'re building piers, we\\'re building oil derricks, we\\'re building wind turbines, we\\'re building all this infrastructure out into the water, and it turns out jellyfish have two life portions. The medusa, which is the part we\\'re used to, the tendrils that come at you and then get you, and then the polyps, which are basically the baby jellyfish, and they need something to stick to. And so you build a whole bunch more reefs and wharfs and stuff, and there\\'s more places for the jellyfish to breed.Sara Ganim:I mean, I\\'m a coastal person. I grew up in Florida. I most certainly have memories of what jellyfish sting feels like. It feels like a sting, right? But beyond that, are there significant risks?Elizabeth Weise:So they all sting, but at different levels, and most of them, yeah, it\\'s just annoying, but in a day it was gone. We are starting to see some jellyfish, like the box jellies, that actually it can be serious. I mean, people have died. It\\'s pretty uncommon, and you have to have a really strong reaction, but they\\'re like nastier. One of the scientists I spoke to said that, yeah, when she was doing work in Australia with jellyfish, and she said you had to wear basically a rash guard when there were really big blooms. She said it was not a good look, but-Sara Ganim:So is this going to be like the seaweed? Is it going to muck up the beach experience? Is it going to feel like the plague or a jellyfish apocalypse?Elizabeth Weise:Well, it\\'s not the jellyfish apocalypse we were worried about 20 years ago. One good thing is they\\'re seeing that some of the predatory fish are starting to realize, \"Oh, here\\'s this new food source.\" A balance is achieved, but it might take a little bit.Sara Ganim:What should those of us who frequent the beach in the summer do to better protect ourselves?Elizabeth Weise:If you see jellyfish, swim away from them. If you see them on the beach, do not pick them up. Do not scrape them off or use sand. Wash them off with seawater. Straight vinegar can deactivate the venom. And then if you do get stung, getting in hot water, like a hot tub can deactivate it. But it takes 30, 35 minutes. So I mean, mostly it\\'s like a bad mosquito bite. It\\'s just going to take a while until it feels better.Sara Ganim:Elizabeth Weise is a national correspondent for USA TODAY. Elizabeth, thank you so much.Elizabeth Weise:As always a pleasure.♦Taylor Wilson:Thanks for listening to The Excerpt.

       "  'Last year, over 500 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in state legislatures, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

       "  'The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has dismissed a challenge from transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who had asked the Swiss-based court to reject a policy that would prevent her from competing in women\\'s races at elite competitions.In its ruling, which was published Wednesday, the panel of arbitrators determined that Thomas did not have standing to challenge the policy created by swimming\\'s international federation, World Aquatics. The CAS panel found that \"for the time being\" she is not eligible to compete in elite competitions through World Aquatics or USA Swimming, so the policy does not apply to her.\"She is currently only entitled to compete in USA Swimming events that do not qualify as \\'Elite Events,\\'\" according to the arbitral award.Thomas is not on the preliminary entry list for the U.S. Olympic swimming trials, which begin this weekend in Indianapolis ahead of the start of the 2024 Paris Olympics next month.An attorney for the swimmer did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.Thomas competed collegiately at Penn and in 2022 became\\xa0the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA championship at the Division I level. She had argued to CAS that World Aquatics\\' gender inclusion policy − which effectively banned transgender competitors from competing in men\\'s or women\\'s races at elite competitions, such as the Olympic Games or world championships − is discriminatory.The federation\\'s policy proposed the creation of “open category” races for transgender competitors, in addition to categories for men and women.World Aquatics said in a statement provided to USA TODAY Sports that it welcomed the CAS decision, calling it \"a major step forward in our efforts to protect women\\'s sport.\"\"World Aquatics is dedicated to fostering an environment that promotes fairness, respect, and equal opportunities for athletes of all genders and we reaffirm this pledge,\" the federation said. \"Our policies and practices are continuously evaluated to ensure they align with these core values, which led to the introduction of our open category.\\xa0\"We remain committed to working collaboratively with all stakeholders to uphold the principles of inclusivity in aquatic sports and remain confident that our gender inclusion policy represents a fair approach.\"The arbitral award, which was dated Monday, only concerned Thomas\\' standing to challenge the World Aquatics policy, not the legitimacy of the policy itself. The CAS panel said in its decision that it considered her eligibility first and separately as a \"bifurcated issue,\" following a request from the international federation. Thomas objected to World Aquatics\\' request but the panel sided against her.',\n",
       "  'Around 7.6% of the U.S. population is a part of the LGBTQ+ community, a recent Gallup poll found. About one in eight LGBTQ+ adults are transgender, making up slightly less than 1% of the overall adult population.It\\'s Pride Month, which means it\\'s a good time to brush up on your knowledge of the different pride flags you may see at parades this year and the identities within the LGBTQ umbrella.The best first step is to learn about the community. Asking your LGBTQ+ friends and family\\xa0is an option, but be mindful\\xa0of placing the burden of your education on others\\xa0when there are so many\\xa0resources\\xa0at your disposal.The T in LGBTQ stands for transgender. LGBTQ is an acronym of identities related to sexual orientation and gender identity.\\xa0What each letter in LGBTQ means:In recent years, many have added I and A —\\xa0intersex and asexual — to the lineup.

Cisgender people are individuals whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth.\\xa0Before we dive in more, let\\'s take a look at the difference between sex and gender:The T in LGBTQ differs from some of the other letters in the acronym because it is not related to sexual orientation — being transgender has everything to do with gender identity and nothing to do with sexuality. A trans person can be straight, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer or any other\\xa0sexuality that is right for them.\\xa0Trans people may undergo a transition process to more closely align their gender expression and gender identity. This can include telling family and friends to use a different name or pronouns, dressing differently, pursuing sex and name changes on legal documents, starting hormone replacement therapy or undergoing medical procedures. But they also may not, and shouldn\\'t be expected to by family, friends or others.\\xa0Because gender identity is about internal understanding, someone who is trans does not need to do anything to their appearance to be trans\\xa0— they are trans the moment they realize their gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth.\\xa0The trans flag was created in 1999 by Monica Helms, an American trans woman.

Some also use the shortened word \"enby.\"Many nonbinary people use they/them pronouns or neopronouns. They also may ask for the gender neutral honorific Mx as opposed to Mr. or Mrs.\\xa0Trans people have existed for thousands of years across different cultures. Even today, communities\\xa0use varying words to describe gender diversity.
