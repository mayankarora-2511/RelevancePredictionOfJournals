Together, these five countries account for nearly half (48.1 percent) of the 1.1 billion poor people,\" the report said. The report said that approximately 584 million people under 18 are living in extreme poverty, making up 27.9% of all children globally, compared to 13.5% of adults. The findings also indicated that 83.2% of the world\\'s poorest individuals reside in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Meanwhile, low- income countries which comprise 10.2% of the population covered are home to 34.8% of all poor people (400 million). Further, 65.2% of poor (749 million) live in middle- income countries. The report noted that 2023 witnessed more conflicts than at any time since World War II causing displacement of over 117 million people. \"In 2023 there were more ongoing conflicts than at any time since the Second World War.2 The number of people forced to flee from their homes due to violent conflict, disasters or other factors reached an all-time high of 117 million,\" it said.

       "  'Lucknow: In a meeting with divisional commissioners and district magistrates on Friday,  chief secretary  Manoj Kumar Singh issued strict directions to the officials to give \"full respect\" to  public representatives . Asking them to follow  protocol  with respect to public representatives, the CS said that their contact numbers should be saved in the officials\\' mobile phones so that they receive the calls of MPs, MLAs and MLCs, speak to them when they call and are able to return their calls if busy in a meeting. The CS added that at meetings organised at the division and district levels, where public representatives are invited, a respectful seating arrangement should be ensured for them as per protocol. He said that complaints and issues raised by public representatives should be resolved on priority and they should be informed accordingly. Discussing the implementation of the  Zero Poverty-Uttar Pradesh  campaign, the CS said that the data of approximately 1.81 lakh enumerators from 57,000 village panchayats had been uploaded to the portal by block development officers. The process of selecting the poorest families and uploading their information by enumerators will begin on Oct 25. Singh said that a campaign to identify and free encroached pastureland should be launched soon. Reviewing the progress on issuing ration cards to workers registered on the e-Shram portal, the CS said that the final date to lock verified data is Oct 25, 2024, and all districts must provide coverage reports by Nov 11, 2024.

       "  'WASHINGTON: The world\\'s 26  poorest countries , home to 40% of the most poverty-stricken people, are more in debt than at any time since 2006 and increasingly vulnerable to  natural disasters  and other shocks, a new   report showed on Sunday.  The report finds that these economies are poorer today on average than they were on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic, even as the rest of the world has largely recovered from Covid and resumed its growth trajectory.  Released a week before World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings get underway in Washington, the report confirms a major setback to efforts to eradicate  extreme poverty  and underscores the World Bank\\'s efforts this year to raise $100 billion to replenish its financing fund for the world\\'s poorest countries, the International Development Association (IDA).  The 26 poorest economies studied, which have annual per-capita incomes of less than $1,145, are increasingly reliant on IDA grants and near-zero interest rate loans as market financing has largely dried up, the World Bank said. Their average debt-to-GDP ratio of 72% is at an 18-year high and half of the group are either in  debt distress  or at high risk of it.  Most of the countries in the study are in sub-Saharan Africa, from Ethiopia to Chad and Congo, but the list also includes Afghanistan and Yemen.  Two thirds of the 26 poorest countries are either in armed conflicts or have difficulty maintaining order because of institutional and social fragility, which inhibit foreign investment, and nearly all export commodities, exposing them to frequent boom-and-bust cycles, the report said.  \"At a time when much of the world simply backed away from the poorest countries, IDA has been their lifeline,\" World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said in a statement. \"Over the past five years, it has poured most of its financial resources into the 26 low-income economies, keeping them afloat through the historic setbacks they suffered.\"  IDA normally is replenished every three years with contributions from World Bank shareholding countries. It raised a record $93 billion in 2021 and World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming to exceed that with more than $100 billion in pledges by Dec. 6.  Natural disasters have also taken a greater toll on these countries over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2023, natural disasters were associated with average annual losses of 2% of GDP, five times the average among lower-middle-income countries, pointing to the need for much higher investment, the World Bank said.  The report also recommended that these economies, which have large informal sectors operating outside their tax systems, do more to help themselves. This includes improving tax collections by simplifying taxpayer registration and tax administration and improving the efficiency of public spending. ',\n",
       "  'UNITED NATIONS: Young people are facing an unprecedented wave of violence and sexual abuse driven by war,  climate change , hunger, and displacement, the UN\\'s special representative on violence against children has warned.  \"Children are not responsible for war. They are not responsible for climate crisis. And they are paying a huge (price),\" said  Najat Maalla M\\'jid , the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children. \"Violence against children has reached unprecedented levels, caused by multifaceted and interconnected crises,\" she said. M\\'jid, a pediatrician from Morocco, will on Thursday present a damning report to a  UN meeting  showing that brutal violence against children is rife, and that technology is facilitating crimes against young people as never before. \"Ending violence is possible, and it makes economic sense,\" M\\'jid told AFP, stressing that many people globally are committed to ending the scourge. \"The problem is how we can support them, to put all these (solutions) at scale.\" But the situation is dire, her stark report shows. Over 450 million children lived in conflict zones as of the end of 2022, 40 percent of the 120 million displaced people at the end of April were children, and 333 million children live in  extreme poverty . That is compounded by more than 1 billion children who are at high risk of being affected by climate change, which M\\'jid calls a risk multiplier. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-19 year olds, with 46,000 people between the ages of 10 and 19 taking their lives every year. - \\'Parents of the future\\' - Child marriage  is a widespread scourge, M\\'jid warns, with as many as 640 million victims of the practice. As many as 370 million women and girls were subject to rape or other sexual violence during their childhood, according to a separate report by Unicef.  \"Children could be victim of child exploitation, online or offline. They could be victims of child labor, of slavery, of many things... also of children in armed conflict,\" M\\'jid said. She warned that with fighting and lawlessness becoming embedded in several societies globally, such as Sudan and Haiti, \"violence becomes normal.\"  \"When your children are experiencing violence since their early childhood, seeing only that... how are you going to deal with all this?\" Violence against children has a ripple effect, damaging their mental health, impairing their education and stymying their productivity later in life, the report argues. \"Even if you look at it from the perspective of the cost, it is 11 percent of the national GDP in some countries,\" M\\'jid warned. The solution lies in a coordinated approach to public spending, involvement of business and civil society, and engaging children themselves, she said. But squeezed budgets and the rise of conservative policies on sexual health and reproductive rights risk holding back efforts to combat violence against children, M\\'jid warned. \"The issue of the far-right wing and conservatism in many countries will also set back some forms of action regarding sexual reproductive health (and) gender issues,\" M\\'jid said. \"We are facing a very difficult moment,\" she added. \"These children will be the parents of the future generation.\" ',\n",

       "  \"Remember that movie,  ? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem â\\x80\\x93 by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into. That scene tells you everything about Singaporeâ\\x80\\x99s wealth. It reinforced a certain image of the city-state.  Singapore  â\\x80\\x93 everythingâ\\x80\\x99s shiny, everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called â\\x80\\x9c5Csâ\\x80\\x9d, it defined Singaporeansâ\\x80\\x99 aspirations â\\x80\\x93 cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this. Plusâ\\x80¦ This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick. Butâ\\x80¦Singapore is not all shiny, happy. A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s top 100 restaurants) wonâ\\x80\\x99t probably see this, or even know about it â\\x80\\x93 thereâ\\x80\\x99s  poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And itâ\\x80\\x99s a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing. Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesnâ\\x80\\x99t. Why? Singapore govtâ\\x80\\x99s approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (â\\x80\\x9cInequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poorâ\\x80\\x9d) is â\\x80\\x9cto reward citizens in alignment with the work that is doneâ\\x80\\x9d. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants â\\x80\\x9ccitizensâ\\x80¦to protect themselvesâ\\x80¦to do it themselvesâ\\x80\\x9d. If thatâ\\x80\\x99s your take on poverty, obviously thereâ\\x80\\x99ll be no official poverty line. Naturally, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no official count of poor people either. With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (â\\x80\\x9cA handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singaporeâ\\x80\\x9d), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, â\\x80\\x9cthere are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute povertyâ\\x80¦these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree householdsâ\\x80\\x9d. Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesnâ\\x80\\x99t earn enough to cover basic needs. In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty. Economists also use a concept called relative poverty â\\x80\\x93 a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order). By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced â\\x80\\x9cstagnating wages and an increased cost of livingâ\\x80\\x9d. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But itâ\\x80\\x99s also true for that island of gleaming high-rises. In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: â\\x80\\x9cThe city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.â\\x80\\x9d The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, itâ\\x80\\x99s not race but class thatâ\\x80\\x99s become the deepest social faultline. Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp  income inequality  in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons thatâ\\x80\\x99s produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance â\\x80\\x93 but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty. None of this invalidates Singaporeâ\\x80\\x99s success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people donâ\\x80\\x99t know exists. To say  Singaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony.\",\n",

The final list of the selected poorest families will be posted at several locations in the village panchayat secretariat for 15 days.  The CS said the assessment of poverty will be two-tiered. \"The first will include landless persons, those lacking livelihood options, uncertain income, and dependence on daily wage, agricultural labour, persons lacking economic resources, and constant scarcity of food and clothing in the family,\" he said. The second level, he said, will include abandoned or widowed women without govt aid, families where the earning member is disabled, aged 65 or above, a migrant labourer, or where a family member is suffering from a serious illness. It will also include those residing in disaster-affected areas, having a livelihood based on handicrafts, no member skilled in any livelihood, and not being a member of a self-help group.

I am committed to advocating for our dedicated public servants to create an efficient and responsive public service,\" he said. In his interim cabinet, Dissanayake appointed Nandika Sanath Kumanayaka as secretary to the president, Ravi Seneviratne as secretary to the ministry of public security, and Sampath Thuyacontha as secretary to the ministry of defence.  Harini Amarasuriya  was named prime minister, making her the third woman to hold the position, in addition to her roles as minister for justice, education, and labour. Dissanayake also said that traditional political reprisals would not be tolerated, and his administration would aim to protect both the dignity of public servants and citizen satisfaction. \"Traditional political reprisals will not be tolerated in the future,\" Dissanayake said. \"We will not publicly criticize officials in front of the media, as previous leaders have done, nor will we entertain such media spectacles.

Govt will address the issue of a stable source of income for such families.Singh has said that impoverished families will be identified at three levels. Information about the poorest 10-25 families in each gram panchayat will first be collected. A three-tier, hybrid method will be used for the selection of such families, where employees, officers, and officials of the gram panchayats involved in each stage of selection will be held accountable. \"At the first level, the poorest families will be identified using the Mop-up mobile app, based on four key criteria. As per this, these should be families which are either homeless or live in kutcha houses, landless families reliant solely on agriculture for their livelihood, families dependent on daily wages or agricultural labour who have irregular incomes, and families lacking financial resources,\" the CS said. These families will be identified by village-level employees and cadres. Each employee will maintain detailed registrations on the Zero Poverty Portal, which will allow for precise mapping of the families they identify. At the second level, a village-level committee will be established in each gram panchayat, comprising five members: the gram pradhan, a former gram pradhan, the headmaster of the local school, and the head of the two oldest self-help groups.  If there is no self-help group, then ASHA worker and Anganwadi Sevika will serve as alternate members. At the third level, following identification by the cadre and the recommendations of the village-level committee, families will receive an automated vulnerability rating through a digital system. A Performance Support Unit, established at the CS level, will conduct on-site investigations of any suspicious records. If any discrepancy is found, action will be taken against the responsible cadre and the village-level committee. Following the identification procedure, govt will provide benefits of various schemes to the families. This includes ration cards, housing, school admissions, uniforms, textbooks, and other essential resources, medical facilities, including the Ayushman Bharat Insurance Scheme and schemes linked to the labour department.  Benefits under schemes like the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, MNREGA, Skill Development, State Rural Livelihood Mission, Women and Child Development, Nutrition, Jal Jeevan Mission, Namami Gange, etc., will also be extended to the families. \"Families will be supported by the skill development schemes of the State Skill Development Fund and UP Top Up Fund, as well as the Apprenticeship Training Scheme and other govt department initiatives. Additionally, they will benefit from programmes run by CSR initiatives and other non-governmental organisations,\" said a govt spokesperson. The chief secretary said that Zero Poverty portal will be integrated with the Family ID portal. This will help govt identify the poorest families which are not beneficiaries of the National Food Security Mission or who have not yet received a Family ID. \"To create a tailored plan for sustainable income sources for the selected poorest families, students from reputable educational institutions in the respective districts will be engaged with these families. After discussions with the identified families, considering the local conditions and available livelihood opportunities, a project will be developed to explore specific economic possibilities,\" the spokesperson said. The chief development officer will serve as the nodal officer for implementing the scheme at the district level. A multi-sectoral expert team will be established at the state level by Project Concern International India to assist with the implementation, operational support, and monitoring of the scheme.',\n",
       "  'Tesla CEO  Elon Musk and Indian-American billionaire  Vinod Khosla  clashed in a fiery social media spat that quickly went viral. The tech titans locked horns over Argentinaâ\\x80\\x99s economy, specifically President  Javier Milei \\'s conservative policies.  Musk, a well-known fan of Milei\\'s libertarian ideals, didnâ\\x80\\x99t hold back when Khosla criticized the Argentinian leader\\'s  austerity program . Musk fired off a blunt reply, calling Khosla â\\x80\\x9cdumbâ\\x80\\x9d and sparking a heated exchange. It all began when Khosla shared a Financial Times article, accusing Milei of wrecking Argentinaâ\\x80\\x99s economy with Trump-like policies. \"Argentina\\'s unemployment rate soars to 52% under Mileiâ\\x80\\x99s dictatorial austerity program,\" Khosla tweeted, warning that Trump\\'s return to power could lead to similar economic turmoil. His post triggered a flurry of reactions, with Musk at the forefront, disputing Khoslaâ\\x80\\x99s claim with a sharp â\\x80\\x9cdumbâ\\x80\\x9d retort. Khoslaâ\\x80\\x99s alarming statistic turned out to be inaccurate. Xâ\\x80\\x99s community notes quickly fact-checked the claim, showing Argentinaâ\\x80\\x99s unemployment rate at 7.6%, not the outrageous 52% Khosla suggested. The slip-up didnâ\\x80\\x99t stop Khosla from doubling down, however, as he fired back at Musk, calling out the â\\x80\\x9cmacho brainsâ\\x80\\x9d of the tech mogul and accusing him of being biased on his own platform, X (formerly Twitter). The feud took another twist when Musk sarcastically chimed in on a user comment mocking Khosla for the massive error. Khosla, refusing to retreat, responded, \"Poverty is gross underemployment. Too nuanced for macho brains to understand,\" accusing Musk of pushing false narratives while enjoying selective immunity from community comments. As the online skirmish unfolded, CNN added fuel to the fire with a report highlighting Argentinaâ\\x80\\x99s skyrocketing  poverty rate  under Milei. The country has seen 3.4 million more people fall into poverty in 2024 alone, with nearly 53% of Argentinians now affectedâ\\x80\\x94a number that has set social media ablaze as Musk and Khosla continue their digital brawl.',\n",
       "  'Till 2018, like many other members of the  Vantangiya community , Reshma too lived in dire poverty. Her husband, a daily wager, struggled to find steady work due to which the family was under constant financial instability. Looking after six children and an elderly father-in-law, the future seemed bleak and uncertain to her. Things changed for the better when from a state of obscurity and dependence, Reshma emerged as a respected and independent figure in her community after joining a self-help group in 2018. \"Earlier, people knew me by my husband\\'s name but today, I am known as Reshma Bano,\" she says. Her empowerment and newfound confidence became a beacon of inspiration for other women in her village, encouraging them to seek livelihoods, improve sanitation, and adopt better hygiene. The change in Reshma\\'s financial and social condition is a result of the initiatives of the govt which is bringing marginalized communities, like the Vantangiyas and Musahars, into the mainstream. Although Reshma didn\\'t receive formal business training, her connection with the SHG exposed her to a wealth of information about govt schemes and services. This newfound knowledge, combined with her determination, gave her the courage to take risks and explore new opportunities for her family\\'s livelihood. Inspired by her husband and father-in-law\\'s interest in fish farming, Reshma ventured into this business, which proved to be a turning point in her life. She also began small-scale goat rearing, diversifying her sources of income. Once grappling with poverty, Reshma now contributes Rs 60,000-70,000 to her family income annually. \"Hadn\\'t I joined the SHG, this would not have been possible. Today, I can dream of a better future for my children. My confidence has grown, and I am no longer afraid of taking risks. Every woman from our community should such missions of the govt,\" she says.',\n",
       "  'Kolkata: A poem by a former railway magistrate came up during the hearing of a rape case, in which the allegations turned out to be false, in  Calcutta High Court  on Wednesday.

He violated the provisions of law due to his poverty. We must reiterate that poverty cannot be a ground for lodging false complaints against innocent persons.â\\x80\\x9d Three Behrampore residents â\\x80\\x94 Rajbul Sk, Makarul Sk and Asadul Sk â\\x80\\x94 have been languishing in jail for a year following the  false rape case .

The mother has revealed that they had lodged a false complaint due to tremendous pressure from local netas. While tendering unconditional apology, the mother stated that her husband was bed-ridden and the family was dependent on state govt schemes. She claimed that the local netas offered enhanced grants under the scheme, and under mounting pressure from them, she decided to lodge a false complaint. The accused in the case alleged that the girl had been married twice and could not be a minor.  The HC held that prima facie it appeared that the duo had fabricated false evidence. â\\x80\\x9cIt is true that minor victims have been protected by Section 22(2) of the Pocso Act, 2012 even if they make false allegations. But, if a victim misleads the authority regarding her age and persuades the authority to take legal action against an innocent person by claiming that she is a minor, we think that the benefit...is not available to such victim who is not a minor at the time of lodging false complaint,â\\x80\\x9d HC said. The HC directed that after the conclusion of trial, the special judge at Behrampore will inquire into the allegations and if it was found that the alleged survivor was an adult at the time of the complaint, action would be taken.',\n",

       "  'The Road to Freedom:  Economics  and the Good Society by Joseph Stiglitz, makes the case that economic and political  freedom  are inseparable. It seeks to take back the rhetoric of freedom from conservatives and libertarians. Freedom has been interpreted by Western politicians like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and economists like Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. Financial deregulation was named â\\x80\\x98liberalisationâ\\x80\\x99, to connote this freeing. After the fall of communism, this neoliberal consensus swept the world. It says accept claims of market efficiency as a matter of belief, never asking, for instance, why US healthcare is the most expensive in the advanced world, with the worst outcomes. Any failure is ascribed to external factors, not flaws in the system itself. This book argues with those ideas, from a 21st century perspective. Deregulation caused the biggest financial crisis in 75 years, free trade accelerated deindustrialisation, and free corporations exploited consumers, workers and the environment. As philosopher Isaiah Berlin put it, â\\x80\\x9cfreedom for the wolves has often meant death for the sheep.â\\x80\\x9d People struggling with scarcity and fear are not free, the book points out. For Stiglitz, freedom lies in oneâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98opportunity setâ\\x80\\x99, the range of choices actually available to you. What does the right to vote mean to a starving person?2008 may have been the apex of  neoliberalism , when govts rescued the banks, and the cost to the rest of us exceeded the banksâ\\x80\\x99 gains. This is the signature move of the system: losses are socialised, gains are privatised. If this system has led to galloping inequality, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not coincidental. Its first patrons were billionaires and big corporations. We cannot divorce the current distribution of income and wealth from the current and historical distribution of power. Our social problems are not laws of nature or economics â\\x80\\x94 they are choices, the result of rules and regulations governing the economy. Neoliberalism is not only inefficient and unstable, it generates corrosive inequalities and a narrowing of vision, the book says. Adam Smithâ\\x80\\x99s metaphor of the â\\x80\\x98invisible handâ\\x80\\x99, the idea that pursuing self-interest leads to social well-being, has been debunked by the experience of the last quarter-century. Instead of growth and better lives for all, it has brought monopolisation and concentration of economic power. Questions of distribution and questions of efficiency are not separate: even IMF and OECD emphasise that economies with greater equality perform better. The flaw with the libertarian position is that it does not acknowledge actual tradeoffs. To understand freedom, we must understand that we are not islands, our actions affect each other. And when the promise of faster growth and high living standards, widely shared, does not pan out, the loss of hope has political consequences. Fascist and authoritarian govts are a result of the state not doing enough for its citizens, not of it doing too much. Neoliberalism is cracking under its own strains. What this book proposes is a tempered vision of â\\x80\\x98progressive  capitalism â\\x80\\x99, or a rejuvenated social democracy. It would focus on reducing inequality, reining in corporate power, valuing humans and nature as well as GDP and balance sheets. In some sectors, cooperatives or non-profits might work better than profit-maximising companies. Market and state would act in balance, and there would be a key place for collective action, with the aim of truly expanding human freedom.',\n",

       "  \"Orhan Awatramani, popularly known as Orry has recently claimed that a strict  zero-sugar diet  helped him lose almost 23 kilos. Orry weighs 50 kgs right now.  In an episode of Arhaan Khan's podcast, Dumb Biryani, Orry revealed his  weight loss  journey, diet, lifestyle and more. Arhaan Khan is the son of Malaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan. He said his morning begins with an egg white omelet. He skips meals throughout the day and has dinner occasionally. He stressed on his zero-sugar diet and said he aims to lose 2-3 kilos more. Sugar plays a key role in keeping the overall weight stable. Reducing  sugar intake  is key to effective weight loss. Sugar is high in calories but offers little nutritional value, and leads to weight gain if consumed in excess. When you eat sugar rich foods, they cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, which can trigger insulin release. Insulin encourages fat storage, particularly in the abdominal area.  Sugar can increase hunger and cravings, leading to overeating and making weight loss harder. See more:  Instead of cutting down sugar all of a sudden, take baby steps. Cutting back on added sugars, like those or processed foods, will cut calories and boost general health. Foods like fruits and vegetables contain the natural sugars, fiber, vitamins, and minerals that facilitate digestion and prevent sudden spikes in blood sugar. Replacing sugary snacks with protein-rich foods, healthy fats, or whole grains may fill you up longer and keep unwanted calories off your body. Read product labels carefully because sugar could be labeled under many other names such as fructose, sucrose, or corn syrup in most processed foods. Diet plays a key role in weight gain. There are certain signs you must pay attention to. Frequent hunger or cravings even after eating, suggests that your diet is unhealthy and is causing you weight gain. Too much refined carbohydrates or sugar intake causes spikes and crashes in blood sugars, which stimulate overeating. Low energy is another manifestation of unhealthy diet usually caused by a diet of more processed foods and less nutrients. Feeling bloated or having digestive problems can also be linked to high intake of salt or incorrect selection of foods. You could gain weight in case your serving sizes were more than what the body requires and only eating such healthy foods.\",\n",

For instance, some of those who had entered for the marathon informed TOI that despite registering and paying for their kits, they received nothing in return. \"My friends and I were here since 4am, but we did not get our kits because of which we couldn\\'t participate - I feel the arrangements could have been better,\" said a disappointed Himanshu.  Still, for all organisational hiccups, the first  Gurgaon Marathon  on Sunday brought the Millennium City together in a rousing celebration of fitness. People of all ages and from many walks of life - including school and university students, and executives from private and public organisations - could be seen revelling in their hometown\\'s newest experience by testing their levels of stamina. It was motivating enough for those not yet converted, to consider registering next year.  Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, alongside the event\\'s brand ambassador Shikhar Dhawan, flagged off the 10km and 5km runs. The CM then boarded an open jeep and cheered for the participants for a part of the route, which was certified by the Association of International Marathon and Distance Races (AIMS).  Apart from disclosing that the Gurgaon Marathon will become an annual affair - to be held on the last Sunday of February - Khattar announced plans to hold similar events in each district headquarters every month, to aid in spreading the culture of running, and also in growing awareness of the benefits of the activity, throughout the state. Indeed, a related event will be held in Faridabad next Sunday, the CM added.  That many thousands turned up to run, Khattar said, was a reflection of the city\\'s evolving brand identity. Yet, for all the feelgood vibes, plenty remains to be done to bring the marathon up to global standards. Manisha Srivastava, who has twice run the Boston Marathon, believes the city\\'s cosmopolitan vibe, corporate identity and economic heft - as well as the upward mobility of a working population that prioritises healthy living and pursues endurance sports - makes it a magnet for such events. But for that to happen, the government needs to get its act together to improve the quality of life.  \"Before such an event can be conducted, the city infrastructure, especially roads, needs to be upgraded, and the traffic needs to be better organised,\" she said. \"In short, the quality of the event should not be compromised.\" Something, then, for the authorities to seriously mull over before they start planning for next year.  Nonetheless, the dedication of the volunteers, cops and many others ensured the debut edition passed off with as little disruption as possible. And alongside the action on the roads were cultural performances through which the organisers sought to convey important social messages, including advocating for a drug-free Haryana. Among those who took to the stage were Haryanvi singer MD Desi Rockstar and radio jockey Naved.  Winners across categories celebrated, of course, but each one of those who registered and took part was key in making the event a success. Indians took much of the acclaim on the day, but the international contingent also enjoyed their moment in the sun, including Ethiopians Chaltu Gonfa (winner in the women\\'s half marathon) and Mikiyas Yemata Lemlemu (second runner-up in the men\\'s full marathon).  Kiran, who is from Rohtak, and Ajay Kumar of UP won the women\\'s and men\\'s full marathon events respectively, for which they took home Rs.1.5 lakh each. In the half marathon, Chaltu Gonfa and Prashant Choudhary (UP) finished first, earning Rs.1 lakh, while in the open 10km, Ruby Kashyap and Abhishek - both from UP - were declared the winners and awarded Rs.50,000 each. Altogether, cash awards worth some Rs.13 lakhs were handed out to the top finishers. ',\n",
       "  'Patna: In a joint initiative aimed at fostering  sustainable agriculture  and mitigating  climate change  impacts, the   State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) and Tata-Cornell Institute (TCI) on Friday organised a consultative meeting here with a focus on the project titled â\\x80\\x9cTowards a  Zero-Hunger ,  Zero-Carbon  Food System for Bihar.â\\x80\\x9d The Zero-Hunger Zero-Carbon (ZHZC) project, led by TCI, Cornell University, is a two-year endeavour spanning from 2021 to 2023. The project is designed to assess the potential of establishing a food system in Bihar that is both hunger-free and carbon-neutral. TCI utilised expert consultations, extensive field assessments, and district-level data to model scenarios under which Bihar could achieve a zero-hunger and zero-carbon future. The consultative meeting unveiled the final findings of the project, highlighting critical interventions in the crop and livestock sectors with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without compromising farmer yields. At the inaugural session, state agricultural department secretary Sanjay Agarwal spoke on the impact of climate change on agriculture and soil. He outlined measures being taken for both mitigation and adaptation, emphasising the challenges faced by south-eastern Bihar, including erratic rainfall distribution and high temperatures affecting paddy yield. Agarwal discussed the state governmentâ\\x80\\x99s commitment to tackling climate change in the agriculture sector, citing the allocation of Rs 1,62,000 crore for promoting sustainable agriculture under the Agriculture Road Map. He also mentioned chief minister Nitish Kumarâ\\x80\\x99s directives for flagship schemes like Jal Jivan Hariyali and Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA), including a focus on organic farming in the Ganga river belt. BSPCB chairman D K Shukla highlighted the significance of the ZHZC project in the context of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ\\x80\\x99s announcement of providing free rationed food to 21 crore people in India from January 1, 2024. Shukla emphasised the need for sustainable food production without harming the environment and called for funds to address challenges associated with emission reduction in the food system. TCIâ\\x80\\x99s founding director Prabhu Pingali dwelt upon the relationship between climate and agriculture, emphasising the importance of addressing the adverse impacts of climate change through adaptation and mitigation measures. He identified the opportunities for pursuing ZHZC and outlined the projectâ\\x80\\x99s objectives for the next three years. District-level analyses under the ZHZC project revealed varying trends in greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting the need for district-specific strategies to achieve â\\x80\\x9cZero-Hunger, Zero-Carbonâ\\x80\\x9d goals. The findings also identified districts with the greatest potential for a decline in GHG emissions without compromising productivity and household income. The consultative meeting concluded with a commitment to pursuing the identified opportunities over the next three years, working towards a sustainable and resilient food system for Bihar. BSPCBâ\\x80\\x99s member secretary S Chandrashekar proposed a vote of thanks.',\n",

       "  'NEW DELHI/KOLKATA:   on Monday removed Murshidabad deputy inspector-general (DIG) of police Mukesh following two violent incidents there, which EC attributed to \\'lack of supervision\\' by law and order authorities. \"The Commission has decided to remove DIG Murshidabad (in rank of inspector-general) in context of two violent incidents reported there involving use of weapons and explosives and lack of supervision in immediately preventing follow-up incidents,\" EC sources told TOI.  The move led to strong reactions from  West Bengal  chief minister  . She said she is ready to go on  hunger strike  outside EC office. \"If I can fast for farmers for 26 days, I can go on a hunger strike for 55 days outside your office as well. I will see how many jails you have. How many cops you have. And how many people you will thrash. I have been assaulted a lot of times. I know how to fight. I am not a coward! Remember this,\" said Banerjee. The DIG\\'s transfer to a non-election-related posting with immediate effect is in line with EC\\'s declaration during its pre-poll visit to West Bengal that there will be zero tolerance of poll violence and any incident will see fixing of responsibility at the higher levels. EC issued a notification asking West Bengal govt to suggest three eligible officers as probable replacements for Mukesh by 5pm on Monday. The state has proposed three IPS officers - Syed Waquar Raza, currently posted with Kolkata police as Joint CP (crime), Ranendra Nath Banerjee, DIG (IB), and Debasmita Das, DIG (STF) - for EC to choose from. The transfer comes after violence in Murshidabad\\'s Beldanga, after which prohibitory orders had to be clamped and 10 people were arrested. \"Today one of our DIGs has been changed following BJP\\'s instruction. If   take place in Murshidabad and Malda, EC will have to take responsibility. I know who can pacify riots. You did it knowingly after listening to BJP. Ab chun chun ke officer change kar rahe hain (Now they are changing select few officers). If there is even a single instance of riot, we will hold you responsible as you are in-charge of law and order maintenance now,\" Mamata said while campaigning in Dimdima for Alipurduar candidate Prakash Chik Baraik. Since the announcement of Lok Sabha polls, EC has ordered a slew of transfers in West Bengal, including that of DGP Rajeev Kumar and non-cadre district magistrates Bidhan Chandra Roy from Purba Bardhaman, Tanvir Afzal from Purba Medinipur, Purnendu Kumar from Birbhum, and Sunil Agarwala from Jhargram. Additionally, the poll body has relieved two senior officers, additional chief electoral officer   Chowdhury and joint chief electoral officer Rahul Nath, of poll management duties in West Bengal.',\n",
       "  'BATHINDA: Households across all continents wasted over 1 billion meals a day in 2022, while 783 million people were affected by  hunger  and a third of humanity faced  food insecurity .  Food waste  continues to hurt the  global economy  and fuel  climate change , nature loss, and pollution. These are the key findings of UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) report published on Wednesday, ahead of the International Day of Zero Waste. The UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2024, co-authored with environmental charity, waste and resources action programme (WRAP), provides the global estimate on food waste at retail and consumer levels. It provides guidance for countries on improving data collection and suggests best practices in moving from measuring to reducing food waste.  In 2022 there were 1.05 billion tonnes of food waste generated (including inedible parts), amounting to 132 kilograms per capita and almost one-fifth of all food available to consumers. Out of the total food wasted in 2022, the 60 per cent happened at the household level, with food services responsible for 28 per cent and retail 12 per cent. â\\x80\\x9cFood waste is a global tragedy. Millions go hungry as food is wasted across the world. Not only is this a major development issue, but the impacts of such unnecessary waste are causing substantial costs to the climate and nature. If countries prioritise this issue, they can significantly reverse food loss and waste, reduce climate impacts and economic losses, and accelerate progress on global goalsâ\\x80\\x9d, said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. Since 2021, thereâ\\x80\\x99s been a strengthening of the data infrastructure with more studies tracking food waste. Globally, the number of data points at the household level almost doubled. Nevertheless, many low- and middle-income countries continue to lack adequate systems for tracking progress to meet Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 of halving food waste by 2030, particularly in retail and food services. Only four G20 countries (Australia, Japan, UK, USA) and the European Union have food waste estimates suitable for tracking progress to 2030. Canada and Saudi Arabia have suitable household estimates, with Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s estimate expected late 2024. In this context, the report serves as a practical guide for countries to consistently measure and report food waste. The data confirms that food waste is not just a â\\x80\\x98rich countryâ\\x80\\x99 problem, with levels of household food waste differing in observed average levels for high-income, upper-middle, and lower-middle-income countries by just 7 kg per capita. At the same time, hotter countries appear to generate more food waste per capita in households, potentially due to higher consumption of fresh foods with substantial inedible parts and a lack of robust cold chains. According to recent data, food loss and waste generates 8-10 per cent of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions â\\x80\\x93 almost 5 times that of the aviation sector â\\x80\\x93 and significant biodiversity loss by taking up the equivalent of almost a third of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s agricultural land. The toll of both food loss and waste on the global economy is estimated at roughly USD 1 trillion. Urban areas are expected to particularly benefit from efforts to strengthen food waste reduction and circularity. Rural areas generally waste less food, with greater diversion of food scraps to pets, livestock, and home composting as likely explanations. As of 2022, only 21 countries have included food loss and/or waste reduction in their national climate plans (NDCs). The 2025 NDCs revision process provides a key opportunity to raise climate ambition by integrating food loss and waste. The Food Waste Index Report underscores the urgency of addressing food waste at both individual and systemic levels. Robust baselines and regular measurement are needed for countries to show changes over time. Thanks to implementation of policies and partnerships, countries such as Japan and the UK show that change at scale is possible, with reductions of 31 per cent and 18 per cent respectively. â\\x80\\x9cWith the huge cost to the environment, society, and global economies caused by food waste, we need greater coordinated action across continents and supply chains. We support UNEP in calling for more G20 countries to measure food waste and work towards SDG12.3,â\\x80\\x9d said Harriet Lamb, CEO of WRAP. â\\x80\\x9cThis is critical to ensuring food feeds people, not landfills. Public-Private Partnerships are one key tool delivering results today, but they require support: whether philanthropic, business, or governmental, actors must rally behind programmes addressing the enormous impact wasting food has on food security, our climate, and our wallets.â\\x80\\x9d UNEP maintains tracking country-level progress to halve food waste by 2030, with a growing focus on solutions beyond measurement towards reduction. One such solution is systemic action through public-private partnerships (PPPs): Bringing the public sector, private sector and non-government to work together, identify bottlenecks, co-develop solutions, and drive progress. Appropriate financing can enable PPPs to deliver farm-to-fork reductions in food waste, drive down GHGs emissions and water stress, while sharing best practices and encouraging innovation for long-term, holistic change. PPPs on food loss and waste are growing worldwide, including in Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and in the UK where they have helped cut over a quarter of household food waste per capita from 2007-18.',\n",

       "  'RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazil\\'s presidential election on Sunday is being contested by 11 candidates but only two stand a chance of reaching a run-off: former President  Luiz Inacio  Lula  da Silva  and incumbent Jair  Bolsonaro . Both are political titans, and eight of 10 Brazilians will vote for one of them, according to pollster Datafolha. That leaves little space for challengers and means that in lieu of fresh proposals and detailed programmes, the two frontrunners have mostly harped on their experience and railed against each other.  \"Both candidates are very well known, the vote is very crystallized,\" said Nara Pavao, who teaches political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco, adding that most voters made up their minds long ago.   Sunday\\'s election could signal the return of the world\\'s fourth-largest democracy to a leftist government after four years of far-right politics led by a president criticised for challenging democratic institutions, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that killed nearly 700,000 people and an economic recovery that has yet to be felt by the poor.   Polls show da  Silva  with a commanding lead that could possibly even give him a first-round victory without any need for a runoff.   But even if that doesn\\'t happen, the vote itself marks an improbable political comeback for da Silva, a 76-year-old former metal-worker who rose from poverty to the presidency - then just four years ago was jailed as part of a massive corruption investigation that targeted his Workers\\' Party and upended Brazilian politics.   Da Silva\\'s conviction for corruption and money laundering sidelined him from the 2018 race that polls showed him leading, and allowed Bolsonaro - then a fringe, far-right lawmaker - to cruise to victory.   A year later, however, the Supreme Court annulled da Silva\\'s convictions amid accusations the judge and prosecutors manipulated the case against him, which has allowed him to run again now.   In many ways, Sunday\\'s vote is the race that should have been in 2018. And many voters are acutely aware of that.   Among them is Antonio dos Santos, who voted for Bolsonaro in 2018 but will cast his ballot for da Silva this time.   \"What I\\'m most upset about is when the pandemic started, (Bolsonaro) seemed to be taking it as a joke,\" said dos Santos, a 55 year-old hairdresser who lives in the working-class Rio neighbourhood of Rocinha.   \"Children dying, women losing their husbands. He\\'s not the man I thought he was.\"   \"What matters to me is to see Brazil doing well, everyone working, everyone eating,\" he said.   Throughout his campaign, da Silva has sought to remind working class voters like dos Santos that his 2003-2010 presidency was marked by social advancement propelled by a massive social welfare programme that helped lift tens of millions into the middle class.   That isn\\'t what Bolsonaro, who frequently refers to da Silva as a \"thief\" and an \"ex-jailbird\", wants voters to remember.   A former army captain, he campaigned in 2018 on an anti-corruption platform while defending a show-no-mercy approach to crimefighting, traditional family values and national pride. His 2018 slogan - \"Brazil above all, God above everyone\" - is back this year.   But this time around Bolsonaro\\'s campaign has met fresh headwinds, in part due to his COVID-19 policies that a Senate investigation said warranted criminal charges to hold him responsible for Brazil\\'s 685,000 pandemic deaths.   Women in particular have turned their backs on him. Many were dismayed by his apparent lack of empathy during the pandemic as he spurned vaccines and largely ignored their plight as the primary caretakers of children and the elderly while Brazil was ravaged by the virus.   \"Bolsonaro was already rejected by women in 2018, but it got worse,\" said Carolina Botelho, a researcher with the Institute of Social and Political Studies at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.   In that demographic, da Silva still enjoys a 20-point lead over Bolsonaro, who has sought to improve his standing among women and others by highlighting his administration\\'s generous pandemic welfare programme.   But tough times remain. As elsewhere in the world, Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine stoked inflation and food insecurity in Latin America\\'s largest nation.   Bolsonaro has softened the blow by lowering taxes on fuel and supporting Congress\\' push to extend and increase welfare payments for millions of struggling Brazilians.   Da Silva has denounced the latter measure as a temporary fix, given it ends in December. He promises to fight hunger and poverty the way he did during his presidency, through his globally acclaimed  Zero Hunger  strategy.   His pick for running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, a center-right former rival, was a nod to financial markets - more recently bolstered by an endorsement from a former central bank governor who highlighted sound macroeconomic policy in a previous da Silva administration.   Bolsonaro\\'s four years in office have also been marred by the Amazon rainforest\\'s worst deforestation in 15 years.   But no single Bolsonaro claim has driven moderates to rally around da Silva like the current president\\'s insistence that Brazil\\'s electronic voting system is prone to fraud.   His claim, for which he has presented no evidence, has raised concerns that he could reject election results and attempt to cling to power.   Earlier this month, Bolsonaro said in an interview that if he doesn\\'t win Sunday\\'s first round, \"something abnormal has happened within the electoral court\".   Bolsonaro has even accused top members of the electoral authority, who are also Supreme Court justices, of working against him. Such comments fuel a sense among Bolsonaro\\'s avid supporters that the race is rigged, reflected in comments online and with political violence increasingly spilling into real life.   \"Bolsonaro is seen as a threat beyond political divergencies, but also to democracy and institutions,\" said Mario Braga, political analyst at Control Risks, adding that it helps explain why da Silva has garnered a bevy of endorsements.   Among the few demographics where Bolsonaro is polling in front are evangelical Christians, who represent nearly a third of the population. Evangelicals helped carry him to power in 2018, and he proceeded to tap members of their churches for important ministries and for a Supreme Court nomination.   Bolsonaro has shored up their support this time around with a campaign to portray the nation as spiritually ill and arguing only he can safeguard the Christian faith. His targeting of da Silva includes linking him to the country\\'s Afro-Brazilian faiths.   Bolsonaro and his supporters have argued this year\\'s polls underestimate the far-right leader\\'s popularity.   \"The ideas of the right have always been ours: family, religion, education, sexual boundaries. ... We are conservative,\" said Maria do Carmo, who will vote for Bolsonaro again on Sunday.   Echoing many other Bolsonaro backers, do Carmo added that she mistrusted polls and the country\\'s electronic voting machines.',\n",
       "  'POCO DA CRUZ: In a small cement house crumbling to ruins in  Brazil \\'s parched Sertao region, Maria da Silva, a graying matriarch struggling to feed her family, opens her empty refrigerator and breaks down in sobs.  The 58-year-old widow, whose creased brown face betrays her burdens, lost her family\\'s main breadwinner when her brother, who worked in Sao Paulo, died of Covid-19 last year.  Now she and her family of eight, who are squatting in an abandoned shack, are among the 33.1 million Brazilians living in hunger.  The figure -- a 73-percent increase in the past two years, according to the Brazilian Network for Research on Food Security -- has become the subject of a bitter political battle as Latin America\\'s biggest economy heads for elections on October 2.  Holding a nearly empty can of powdered milk for the three young grandchildren who live with her, ages three, two and 15 months, Da Silva gives a tour of her dilapidated house, which has no bathroom or running water.  \"There are times when (the children) ask for food and I don\\'t even have a biscuit or bread to give them,\" she says through tears on the small plot of land the family farms in Poco da Cruz, in the northeastern state of Pernambuco.  Soaring food prices have forced the family to turn to begging, she says.  \"I just pray to God to end my suffering.\"  The presidential front-runner, leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio  Lula  da Silva, regularly attacks far-right incumbent Jair  Bolsonaro  over the fact Brazil reappeared on the World Food Programme\\'s \"Hunger Map\" last year, with 28.9 percent of the population living in \"moderate or severe food insecurity.\"  It is a major setback for a country that had been removed from the map in 2014, after an economic boom and landmark social programs helped lift 30 million people from poverty during Lula\\'s administration (2003-2010).  Bolsonaro has aggressively counter-attacked, accusing Lula of bankrupting Brazil with corruption.  Courting low-income voters, the incumbent has upscaled and rebranded Lula\\'s signature welfare program, and is campaigning extensively in the impoverished northeast, home to a quarter of Brazil\\'s 213 million people.  Sprawled across the northeastern interior, the Sertao, or hinterland, is a semi-arid expanse of brown-and-olive-green scrubland.  Known for cyclical droughts, it is a harsh but beautiful land with an outsize role in Brazilian literature, music and film.  Each generation here remembers its worst drought -- 1960, 1993, 2010 -- and the misery it caused.  Joao Alfredo  de Souza , a community leader in the rural township of Conceicao das Crioulas, weathered all those.  \"It cost us a lot of sweat and tears to overcome,\" says De Souza, a spry 63-year-old who heads a community founded by ex-slaves in the 18th century.  Gesturing from his front porch to a paved street lined with neat, trim houses, De Souza describes Lula\\'s time in office as a watershed of ambitious programs promoting housing, electricity, water, welfare, education and \" Zero Hunger .\"  But the retired farmer says times have been \"very tough\" since Covid-19 hit Brazil, killing 680,000 people and triggering an economic implosion followed by soaring inflation.  He says Bolsonaro has won some northeasterners\\' support by super-sizing Lula\\'s \"Family Stipend\" welfare program -- rebranded \"Auxilio Brasil.\"  Bolsonaro recently tripled the average payment from Lula\\'s day, to 600 reais ($115) a month, and is now pledging to increase it to 800 reais.  De Souza is unimpressed by the election-year spending spree.  \"Why is he doing this only now? It\\'s shameful,\" he says.  He says Lula, a Pernambuco native, \"understands the northeast,\" where he leads in the polls in every state.  \"He\\'s one of us.\"  A half-hour drive away down a bone-jarring dirt road, in Regiao de Queimadas, a settlement still dotted with traditional mud-and-stick houses, signs of progress are harder to find.  A team of officials in four-by-four trucks from the federal government\\'s National Health Foundation is going door-to-door asking whether people have bathrooms.  Many don\\'t.  \"This place is the Africa of Brazil,\" says one of the officials, reflecting a widespread perception of the region among government bureaucrats in Brazil.  The program\\'s ostensible goal is to build adequate facilities for those who need them.  The head of the local farmers\\' association, Edineia de Souza, is skeptical.  \"These guys only come around at election time,\" says the 40-year-old corn and bean farmer.  \"We\\'re still waiting on the bathrooms from last time.\"  De Souza, who helps organize food donations for needy families with a grass-roots charity called Amigos no Sertao, hopes things will change if Lula wins.  \"When he was in office, projects got done,\" she says.  But she doesn\\'t place much faith in politics.  \"Politicians never even come here,\" she says.',\n",
       "  'BEIJING: Residents of a city in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s far west   region say they are experiencing hunger, forced quarantines and dwindling supplies of medicine and daily necessities after more than 40 days in a virus lockdown. Hundreds of posts from Ghulja riveted users of Chinese social media last week, with residents sharing videos of empty fridges, feverish children, and people screaming from their windows. The dire conditions and food shortages are reminiscent of a harsh  lockdown in Shanghai  this spring, when thousands of residents posted online, complaining they were delivered rotting vegetables or denied critical medical care. But unlike in Shanghai, a glittering, cosmopolitan metropolis of 20 million people and home to many foreigners, the harsh lockdowns in smaller cities such as Ghulja have received less attention. As more infectious variants of the coronavirus creep into China, flare-ups have become increasingly common. Under  China\\'s \\'zero-Covid\\' strategy , tens of millions or people are experiencing rolling lockdowns, paralyzing the economy and making travel uncertain. The  lockdown in Ghulja  is also evoking fears of police brutality among the Uighurs, the Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang. For years, the region has been the target of a sweeping security crackdown, ensnaring huge numbers of Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities in a vast network of camps and prisons. An earlier lockdown in Xinjiang was particularly tough, with forced medication, arrests, and residents being hosed down with disinfectant. Yasinuf, a Uighur studying at a university in Europe, said his mother-in-law sent fearful voice messages this weekend saying she was being forced into centralized quarantine because of a mild cough. The officers coming for her reminded her, she said, of the time her husband was taken to a camp for over two years. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s judgement day,â\\x80\\x9d she sighed, in an audio recording reviewed by The Associated Press. â\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t know whatâ\\x80\\x99s going to happen this time. All we can do now is to trust our creator.â\\x80\\x9d Food has been in short supply. Yasinuf said his parents told him they were running low on food supplies, despite having stocked up before the lockdown. With no deliveries, and barred from using their backyard ovens for fear of spreading the virus, his parents have been surviving on uncooked dough made of flour, water and salt. Yasinuf declined to give his surname for fear of retribution against his relatives. He hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been able to study or sleep in recent days, he said, because the thought of his relatives back in Ghulja keeps him up at night. â\\x80\\x9cTheir voices are always in my head, saying things like Iâ\\x80\\x99m hungry, please help us,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the 21st century, this is unthinkable.â\\x80\\x9d Nyrola Elima, a Uighur from Ghulja, said her father was rationing their dwindling supply of tomatoes, sharing one each day with her 93-year-old grandmother. Another relative, her aunt, was panicking because she lacked milk to feed her 2-year-old grandson. Last week at a news conference, the local governor apologized for â\\x80\\x9cshortcomings and deficienciesâ\\x80\\x9d in the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s response to the coronavirus, alluding to â\\x80\\x9cblind spots and missed spots,\" and promised improvements. But even as authorities acknowledged the complaints, the censors worked to silence them. Posts were wiped from social media. Some videos were deleted and reposted dozens of times as netizens battled censors online. Multiple people in the region told AP the posts online reflected the dire nature of the lockdown, but declined to detail their own situations, saying that they feared retribution. On Monday, local police announced the arrests of six people for â\\x80\\x9cspreading rumorsâ\\x80\\x9d about the lockdown, including posts about a dead child and an alleged suicide, which they said â\\x80\\x9cincited oppositionâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cdisrupted social order.\" Leaked directives from government offices show that workers are being ordered to avoid negative information and spread â\\x80\\x9cpositive energyâ\\x80\\x9d instead. One directed state media to film â\\x80\\x9csmiling seniorsâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cchildren having funâ\\x80\\x9d in neighborhoods emerging from the lockdown. â\\x80\\x9cThose who maliciously hype, spread rumors, and make unreasonable accusations should be dealt with in accordance with the law,â\\x80\\x9d one notice warned. The AP was unable to independently verify the notices. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As the authorities mobilize, conditions have improved for some. One resident, reached by phone, said food deliveries resumed after stopping for a couple of weeks. Residents in her compound are now allowed to talk walks in their courtyard for a few hours a day. â\\x80\\x9cThe situation is gradually improving, itâ\\x80\\x99s gotten a lot better,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Authorities have ordered mass testing and district lockdowns in cities across China in recent weeks, from Sanya on tropical Hainan island to southwest Chengdu, to the northern port city of Dalian. In the city of Guiyang, in mountainous southern Guizhou province, a zoo put out a call for help last week, asking for pork, chicken, apples, watermelons, carrots and other produce out of concern they could run out of food for their animals. Elsewhere in the city, residents in one neighborhood complained of hunger and missing food deliveries, prompting a surge of comments online. Local officials apologized, saying that despite their best efforts, they were overwhelmed. â\\x80\\x9cDue to lack of experience and inappropriate methods,â\\x80\\x9d they said in a public notice, â\\x80\\x9cthe supply of basic necessities wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough, bringing inconvenience to everyone. We are deeply sorry.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

The food drive has been a part of the programme, \\'Freedom from Hunger\\', organised by  IHA  Foundation to shed light on the persisting malnutrition and hunger crisis widespread in India, even after 75 years of Independence.  Along with the meals served to the underprivileged, essential rations were also delivered to over 7,500 families, the elderly and over 750 underprivileged children.  IHA chairman Satnam  Singh Ahluwalia  has been consistently working towards project  Zero Hunger , with initiatives like Langar on Wheels, which served meals to over thousands of beneficiaries by the end of the first year of Covid. \"We believe that only when we all ensure the people near our homes have their food and nutrition looked after and made self-sustainable, then our nation can be free from hunger,\" said Ahluwalia.

Naveen, who is currently in Rome at the invitation of the WFP, delivered an address in the presence of WFP executive director  David Beasley  and interacted with senior WFP functionaries on existing partnerships and programmes between Odisha and WFP in India for â\\x80\\x9cZero Hunger.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOver the last two decades, Odisha has been through a transformational journey in the field of food production, food security, livelihoods, disaster management, and so on. By attaining food sufficiency, initiating large-scale development programmes designed around creating climate resilient livelihoods and nutrition, and focussing on partnerships, the state is moving consistently towards sustainable development goals and inclusive development,â\\x80\\x9d Naveen was quoted by his office as saying at the WFP. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be our pleasure to share our experience across the world through WFP and its partner agencies,â\\x80\\x9d he added. The Chief Minister also expressed appreciation for the partnership with WFP on several fronts that have not only been effective in the state but have also been scaled up nationally. Beasley said the joint goal of strengthening livelihoods and food security across Odisha is being translated into action with a series of ambitious projects to support inclusive development and new economic opportunities, especially for women. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s exciting to see how our collaboration is helping to drive Odishaâ\\x80\\x99s progress towards achieving  Zero Hunger  and the other  UN Sustainable Development Goals ,â\\x80\\x9d he said.

       "  'BATHINDA: The institutions and organisations working into climate change though have welcomed strong support for the  Paris Agreement  and its targets including the 1.5 degree C warming limit mainly tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 and voluntary doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030, the language on   from billions to trillion dollars, making an effort to shift the discourse from mitigation - only finance- to resilience and adaptation but they are pessimistic on no agreement on phasing down  coal . For the first time in  G20 , recognises the quantum for climate finance - gives a figure of USD 5.8-5.9 trillion needed by pre 2030 for NDC achievement, and USD 4 trillion annually for achieving  Net Zero  by 2050, which has been welcomed.  Encourages  capacity by 2030 and voluntary doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030.The agreement to triple renewable energy globally will be a huge boost to the clean energy sector if it can be matched with technology and finance.  - maintains the status quo. G20, home to 93% of global operating coal power plants and 88% of new proposed unabated coal power plants failed to agree to end new coal power plant construction. Recognize the importance of  sustainable biofuels  in zero and low- emission development strategies, and note the setting up of a Global Biofuels Alliance. No specific progress on phase down of coal but announced the establishing of a Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre steered by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and also mentions derivatives like ammonia. Although it recognises the need to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030 (relative to 2019 levels) and notes that global peaking must occur before 2025 (as prescribed by the IPCCâ\\x80\\x99s AR6 Synthesis Report), it mentions that this doesnâ\\x80\\x99t imply all countries must peak according to this timeline. This shows that while there is acknowledgement of climate science and policy inputs, principles of CBDR- RC remain alive when it comes to climate action.  Strong support expressed for MDB reforms, including Sustainable Finance Working group recommendations for scaling up blended finance and risk-sharing facilities and the enhanced role of MDBs in mobilising climate finance, especially through concessional resources.  Calls for an ambitious second replenishment process of the Green Climate Fund for its upcoming 2024-2027 programming period  With extreme weather events hitting hard this year, climate change remained high on the geopolitical agenda. There were high expectations, and also differing views on the level of climate action which must be urgently taken across major emitting countries, which include historical emitters like US and Europe but also large economies like China and India. The big climate wins come with the agreement on tripling renewables targets by 2030 and putting a number to the need for climate finance for the first time in G20. The UNFCCCâ\\x80\\x99s first ever Global Stocktake report yesterday reiterated that the window to meet the 1.5 degree C target is closing fast. The Delhi Declaration gives hope towards climate action from the worldâ\\x80\\x99s major emitters responsible for 85% of emissions, however, they missed agreeing on phasing out unabated fossil fuels. Ajay Mathur, Director General, International Solar Alliance (ISA) Through the year, the International Solar Alliance has worked with the G20 Presidency towards fast tracking development, in the G-20 countries and globally, while also mitigating climate change by promoting solar utilization. This can be done in three ways. First, we need to build the knowledge and capacity of all countries to produce, transport and use low and zero carbon hydrogen. ISA has launched the Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre to enable this action. Second, we need to enable solar mini grids to provide universal energy access, especially where grid extension is too expensive. Guarantees help in crowding-in private sector investment into solar mini grids. We need new partnerships â\\x80\\x93 between International Organizations and countries, and in between International Organizations as well, to accelerate solarization. Madhura Joshi, India Lead, E3G, Climate think-tank â\\x80\\x9cWe have seen a landmark decision to support tripling global renewable energy capacity, important for both development and climate goals; support for doubling the rate of energy efficiency, crucial for energy transitions; and for reforming multilateral banks, which can help unlock affordable finance for implementation. Reiterating language from the last G20 on efforts to phase down coal just maintains the status quo. Increasing renewables must be backed by phasing down fossil fuels â\\x80\\x93 both are indispensable for just transitions and a net-zero world. We need stronger bolder action from leaders on both sides. All eyes now on COP28 â\\x80\\x93 can the leaders deliver?â\\x80\\x9d Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends â\\x80\\x9cThe agreement to triple renewable energy globally could be a big boost to the clean energy sector. There is also a pledge to increase the capacity of multilateral development banks to lend more and utilise existing funds better, and a number agreed on the funds required for energy transition but falls short of a clear commitment to increased finance. The language on accelerated phasedown of unabated coal is from last year. In the context of tripling renewable energy, it assumes even greater significance because not calling for phase down of fossil fuels will mean stranded power assets in the near future.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 Vibhuti Garg, Director, South Asia, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, (IEEFA) â\\x80\\x9cThe Leaders Declaration captures all the ingredients for restricting global temperatures to 1.5 degrees by highlighting the need for countries to develop pathways that are aligned with this goal. It also rightly says the need for tripling of renewable energy and access to low cost finance as the need for finance are estimated to the tune of USD4 trillion annually, the agreement is on facilitating and not committing to it. While the progress is good, a time commitment on both the renewable energy target and allocation of finance to energy and developing countries would have strengthened the commitment from nations on the issue of climate crisis which all the countries have been subjected to.â\\x80\\x9d No further commitment on increasing the availability of finance to developing countries beyond USD 100 billion. The net zero target needs much higher investment and if that commitment is not enhanced, it will be difficult for countries in the global south to achieve their climate goals. On Tripling of Renewable Energy Aditya Lolla, Asia Programme Lead, Ember â\\x80\\x9cThis is a significant and surprising step forward by the G20. A tripling of global renewable capacity by 2030 is the biggest single action that would keep 1.5 degrees within reach. It creates two important precedents. First, it dramatically increases the odds that a global goal to triple renewables can be agreed at COP28 in December. Second, and most importantly, it creates a necessity for countries to go back and reassess their own plans to make sure they are consistent with a tripling of global renewables. Developed countries have a responsibility to help facilitate low-cost financing for renewable energy in emerging countries, so it was great to see the G20 also mention the importance of this. For Saudi Arabia and Russia to now lend support to renewables is welcome. On Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Shruti Sharma, Senior Policy Advisor, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) â\\x80\\x9cThe G20 leaders declaration has acknowledged the significance of addressing fossil fuel subsidies, but there has been no progress in the text since the Bali declaration. For the past 15 years, G20 leaders have consistently reiterated their commitment to reforming fossil fuel subsidies, but failed to deliver tangible progress in terms of transparency, timelines, and subsidies reduction. The absence of a well-defined deadline for phasing out of fossil fuel subsidiesâ\\x80\\x94such as 2025 for developed countries and 2030 for emerging economiesâ\\x80\\x94reduces the accountability of the G20 in delivering its 2009 commitment to phase out this support.â\\x80\\x9d On Global Biofuel Alliance Devinder Sharma, Trade and Food Policy Analyst \"At a time when the UN has set a goal to achieve \\'Zero Hunger\\' by 2030, to form a global biofuel alliance would be nothing short of a historic blunder. Political leadership must think of feeding humans first, automobiles can wait. Food should never be diverted for activities which have nothing to do with domestic food security. Interestingly, we are getting to a stage when the food we produce will go to feed automobiles, and it will be left to companies to produce synthetic food in the labs for the human population.\" Purva Jain, Energy Analyst, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, (IEEFA) \"The formal launch of the Global Biofuels Alliance at the G20 Summit in Delhi reflects Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s commitment to clean fuels. Archana Chaudhary, Senior independent journalist â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99Overall itâ\\x80\\x99s a good move if it helps nations cut reliance on expensive fuel imports. But is not exactly good news for some agricultural economies because it will push farmers to produce more crops that support ethanol and similar biofuels, diverting farm land away from pure food production, affecting food security.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 ',\n",
       "  \"BATHINDA: Ahead of next weekâ\\x80\\x99s United Nations Food Systems Summit stocktaking event, the largest global food justice movements, small-scale food producer organisations, and Indigenous People have released a new statement denouncing the United Nationsâ\\x80\\x99 approach to tackling hunger and malnutrition. Representatives from the People's Autonomous Response to the  UN Food Systems Summit  (UNFSS) highlighted the urgent, coordinated actions that are needed to overcome the global  hunger crises , and respond to the rights and demands of those most affected by the hunger, climate and health crises.  â\\x80\\x9cThe UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) has not only overlooked our rights and the structural causes of the crises,â\\x80\\x9d says SaÃºl Vicente from the International Indian Treaty Council adding the intention of the Summit organizers is to sell us the corporate and industrial project as transformation. The movements and organizations opposing the Summit call for an urgent shift away from corporate-driven industrial models and towards bio-diverse, agro-ecological, community-led food systems that prioritize the public interest over profit-making.  â\\x80\\x9cThe rights of people to access and control land and productive resources must be guaranteed, and agroecological production models and peasant seeds promoted.â\\x80\\x9d Ibrahima Coulibaly, President of the Network of West African Farmers and Agricultural Producersâ\\x80\\x99 Organizations (ROPPA) Two years ago, the UN Summit sparked an unprecedented global counter mobilization. The main concern of the Summitâ\\x80\\x99s critics was â\\x80\\x93 and remains â\\x80\\x93 the escalating influence of corporations and their proxy organizations within the United Nations.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t appoint the goat as gardener, a peasant proverb saysâ\\x80\\x9d, Patti Naylor from the National Family Farm Coalition warns: â\\x80\\x9cThe corporate agriculture, food and data giants donâ\\x80\\x99t care about democratic governance in the UN â\\x80\\x93 they just use it for their profits. Like the goat, corporations will eat the salad and the roses, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t stop themâ\\x80\\x9d. Real food systems change for people and the planet is urgently needed and possible, but with the current hunger figures, the UN will not meet their Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030. This ongoing and systemic crisis is a product of policy failures and omissions, and a result of pursuing a problematic path that leads to the exacerbation of inequalities and dependencies, destruction of environments and biodiversity, and spillover effects aggravating the global debt and  climate crises .  â\\x80\\x9cOver the past two decades, people from all over the world have presented concrete, effective strategies for addressing the climate and food crises based on respect for social and racial diversity, justice, and human and collective rights. Foremost among these are  food sovereignty , agroecology, revitalisation of biodiversity, territorial markets and a solidarity-based economy,â\\x80\\x9d says Shalmali Guttal, from Focus on the Global South. â\\x80\\x9cThe evidence is overwhelming â\\x80\\x93 the solutions devised by small-scale food producers and  Indigenous Peoples  not only feed the world but also advance gender, social, economic justice, youth empowerment, workersâ\\x80\\x99 rights and real resilience to crises. Why are policy makers not listening to them and providing them with adequate support?â\\x80\\x9d A new FIAN report released in parallel to the statement â\\x80\\x98Food Systems Transformation -- In which directionâ\\x80\\x99, calls for an urgent overhaul of the global food governance architecture to guarantee decision-making that prioritizes the public good and the right to food for all. â\\x80\\x9cThe communities in the front lines of the food crisis are being used by corporations as an alibi to increase profits. The tragedy is that policy makers at the food system summit are ignoring social movementsâ\\x80\\x99 far more effective ideas about how to end hunger.â\\x80\\x9d Raj Patel â\\x80\\x9cIn these times of growing hunger and multiple crises, it is more urgent than ever that governments and the UN listen to usâ\\x80\\x9d says Perla Ã\\x81lvarez from La VÃ\\xada Campesina. â\\x80\\x9cWe call on you: change direction, and support our demands and efforts for a food sovereign future based on human rights and the principles of agroecology, care, justice, diversity, solidarity and accountability.â\\x80\\x9d\",\n",
       "  \"The bond between people and animals has been strong for eternity, as is also illustrated in ancient sculptures, carvings, and murals of various cultures. It is a fact that  pets  offer more than just companionship. Over the past three decades of research, it has been discovered that animals have a long-lasting and deep influence on our mental as well as physical wellness. In this article, Dr. Anureet Sethi, Chairperson Co-founder at Trijog â\\x80\\x93 Know Your Mind Pvt. Ltd., shares how pets can enhance our  well-being : Whether playing fetch, taking a long walk, or simply sitting together, pets leave you feeling loved and happy. Studies conducted worldwide have long established that being around furry friends has a two-pronged effect on our brains. The first is the decrease in cortisol, or the stress hormone, due to interaction with pets, which lowers blood pressure. Secondly, being with your pet prompts the release of oxytocin by your brain, a chemical which has popularly been called the 'love hormone'. Many hospitals and health professionals are using  pet therapy  as an effective and impactful mode to hasten the healing of patients. Pets are like emotional anchors in today's fast-moving, busy world where more people are becoming disengaged from each other. They elicit mindfulness and are an essential component of well-being because they make humans live in the present by providing a grounding influence. Their need for care promotes empathy and provides an opportunity to destress. Small and simple acts like stroking a pet's head, cuddling them, playing with them, or just seeing a fish swim around can help lower your anxiety and help induce calmness in your daily life by replacing negativity with positivity. This is particularly useful for trauma patients, the elderly, children, and especially beneficial to those struggling with severe mental challenges.  The daily routine of living with a pet can be extremely rewarding and satisfying. Taking them on daily walks has physical benefits - not only do you stay fit, it can also lead to new friendships that can help you socially. Unlike complex relationships, pets are not judgemental and provide unconditional support whether you are a success or failure. This provides an emotional safety net where an individual can express themselves freely, which helps build psychological wellness. Their presence helps ease social burden and act like a stabilizing force that cultivates emotional balance and well-being.  Humans keep pets for various reasons, such as companionship, service dogs to help with illness, watchdogs, and more. Whatever the reason, the profound impact of a pet on the well-being of a human goes beyond these reasons. The gratification that a companion animal delivers is like none other. In today's era, families are becoming smaller, and pets are integral to the family. There is a reason why pet owners call themselves â\\x80\\x98pet parentsâ\\x80\\x99. Their presence gives a sense of purpose and routine that elevates psychological well-being and resilience.  It is not necessary to always use verbal communication to elevate a personâ\\x80\\x99s mood or  mental health . Non-verbal communication, like a lick or a snuggle by your little friend can significantly elevate one's mood, leading to a deeply satisfying life and balanced mental health. The welcome you get when you return home from a hard day at work is usually reward enough for the work you need to put in to maintain your pet. If you have a pet, count your blessings, and if you donâ\\x80\\x99t have one- you must explore adopting a pet to make your life happy and complete.\",\n",
       "  '\"As the societies have evolved, so have the stressors and this has resulted in a very different set of problems being faced by employees of today. India is experiencing several unfortunate events where employees are succumbing to a toxic mix of extreme stress both at workplace and beyond,\" says Jitin Bhasin, CEO and Founder, SaveIN. In this article, he writes about how employers can promote better  mental health  at their workplace and reduce  stress-related risks  for their employees. He adds, the stark reality of todayâ\\x80\\x99s fast paced, ever connected world with relentless pressure to meet targets and stiff deadlines is taking a toll on the physical and mental well-being of employees and thereby their productivities at work. Data also shows that there is a worrying correlation between chronic workplace stress and rising incidents of health-related complications causing premature deaths. As this issue assumes greater importance, it is critical to assess the deep impact of workplace stress on an employeeâ\\x80\\x99s health and the need for organizations to prioritize mental wellness. While a set of companies in India offer  corporate health insurance  to their employees, it is no longer enough to offer only hospitalization coverage; the focus needs to be on preventive care, elective treatments, work-life balance, and overall  wellness programs  with inbuilt response mechanisms to deal with emergency situations. To build effective wellness programs that would be relevant for today, companies should start by listing comprehensive health initiatives that can be undertaken commensurate to resources that can be allocated. These programs should be well-planned, with dedicated teams and must involve the managerial and leadership teams along with HR function, to ensure they are both sustainable and impactful. A wellness program designed for the needs of today should go beyond hospitalization coverage and must address day-to-day well-being, including physical fitness, mental health, preventive check-ups and elective treatments. It has been observed that including health and wellness as a Key Performance Indicator within an employeeâ\\x80\\x99s performance assessment, along with offering incentives for fitness goals, encouraging planned vacations, and promoting healthy work habits can go a long way in making wellness a mainstream subject in an organization. Encouraging walking meetings, team activities, healthy food options, and support for families like daycare or elder care services can also be significant additions to wellness programs. Employees face enhanced stress on account of business targets, personal challenges, long commutes, constant digital connectivity, and sedentary lifestyles. Organizations and managers can make a significant difference by setting realistic goals, holding periodic discussions and performance improvement exercise, offering structured breaks, and career planning sessions. A  hybrid work system , that balances on-site and work from home can also be a great way to enable employees to manage work and life commitments. Additionally, there are new age AI-based tools which can be used to monitor  employee well-being  and providing access to professional counsellors where needed.  In the event of an unforeseen event, safety protocols also become equally important; employers should establish emergency plans, install first aid kits and defibrillators, and train staff to handle health emergencies such as heart attacks or strokes. It is important for the leadership teams to realize that promoting a culture of health and fitness is a constant commitment that needs to be led by the those in the capacity to influence change. By focusing on these areas, companies can create a healthier workplace with highly productive and happy workforce.  Prioritizing  employee health  may seem difficult and expensive in the near term, but has a compounding impact in the medium to long term and it is time that India Inc. embraces this fact and makes a step in the right direction.',\n",

       "  \"In a world forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have turned to  astrology  for guidance, particularly when it comes to  mental health  and  emotional well-being . As we collectively recover from the emotional turbulence of the past few years, the cosmic movements of the planets are being examined with greater interest. Astrology offers a unique lens to understand not only personal mental health struggles but also collective emotional shifts. How exactly do the planets play a role in influencing our moods, emotions, and mental resilience in this  post-pandemic  landscape?  Each planet in astrology governs different areas of life and influences particular emotions. The Moon, for example, is known to be the ruler of our emotional landscape, moods, and inner feelings. It shifts every two to three days, making it a key player in our day-to-day emotional fluctuations. After months of isolation, fear, and uncertainty during the pandemic, many have become more in tune with their emotional cycles, looking to the  Moon  for clarity. New Moons and Full Moons are especially significant as they mark times of new beginnings and emotional culmination, respectively.  Meanwhile, the outer planets, like Saturn and  Pluto , which take years to move through a sign, are associated with longer-term cycles of transformation and healing. Saturn, known as the taskmaster planet, can signify challenges and restrictions. During the pandemic, Saturn's transit through Capricorn and Aquarius reflected the isolation, structure, and responsibility that defined this era. However, its placement in a birth chart can also point to how an individual manages discipline, resilience, and recovery. For many, recognizing these patterns has helped them navigate difficult emotions during lockdowns and restrictions.  Neptune, the planet of dreams, illusions, and healing, has played a profound role in post-pandemic emotional recovery. Often associated with spirituality and introspection, Neptune encourages people to escape from the harsh realities of life through creativity, imagination, or spiritual practice. As the world adjusted to a new normal, many found solace in these areas, from reconnecting with creative hobbies to exploring meditation, yoga, and astrology itself.  Pluto, the planet of transformation and rebirth, is equally important in understanding how the pandemic has led to personal and societal transformation. It governs deep psychological shifts, unearthing trauma and buried emotions that need to be confronted for growth. The post-pandemic world has seen a rise in mental health awareness, therapy, and self-care practices. Many individuals have experienced deep emotional shifts, with Pluto guiding them through phases of destruction and rebuilding. Astrology offers insight into how these processes unfold on both an individual and collective level.  Ah, Mercury retrogradeâ\\x80\\x94the astrological phenomenon that most people associate with chaos and confusion. Mercury, the planet of communication, thinking, and mental processes, goes retrograde three or four times a year, often throwing peopleâ\\x80\\x99s minds into a whirlwind. While Mercury retrograde can disrupt technology and communication, it also presents an opportunity for reflection and introspection, particularly regarding mental clarity. During the pandemic, when uncertainty reigned, Mercury retrogrades offered moments to step back, reanalyze, and process what was happening around us.  Post-pandemic, these retrograde cycles can be seen as an invitation to reassess how we communicate, cope, and think about mental health. Mercury retrograde has helped many individuals take a pause and reflect on how they manage stress, anxiety, and emotional overload.  Jupiter, the planet of expansion, optimism, and growth, plays a crucial role in balancing the emotional challenges brought by the pandemic. Its energy promotes hope, positivity, and emotional resilience. Jupiter transits often align with moments of personal growth, encouraging us to expand our perspectives and embrace new experiences. In a post-pandemic world, Jupiterâ\\x80\\x99s influence is a reminder to seek joy, practice gratitude, and focus on emotional abundance after a period of fear and contraction.  For those looking for mental health guidance through astrology, Jupiter can offer insights into how to nurture  emotional growth  and recovery, whether through therapy, mindfulness practices, or simply embracing hope for the future.  Astrology doesnâ\\x80\\x99t replace professional mental health care, but it does offer a unique way to understand emotional patterns and navigate lifeâ\\x80\\x99s challenges. For those who feel overwhelmed by the post-pandemic world, the planets provide a symbolic map for emotional well-being and healing. As we continue to rebuild and recover, the stars remind us that emotional shifts are cyclical, and with each planetary movement, we are offered new opportunities for growth, healing, and emotional clarity. In these times, looking up to the cosmos can be a grounding and empowering experience.\",\n",

       "  \"A recent survey conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) under its Comprehensive Annual Modular Survey (CAMS) has revealed troubling data regarding the digital capabilities of India's youth. Less than one-third of individuals in the 15-29 age group can perform basic internet functions such as searching for information, sending or receiving emails, and conducting online transactions. This critical finding exposes a significant digital divide in India, a country where access to the internet is increasingly synonymous with access to quality education and knowledge. The survey highlights three key age groups: 15-24 years, 15-29 years, and individuals aged 15 and above. The results show significant variation between urban and rural populations, with urban males leading in digital proficiency while rural females lag far behind. As per the report, only 26.8% of persons aged 15-24, 28.5% of those aged 15-29, and 25.0% of individuals aged 15 and above can simultaneously search for information online, send or receive emails, and perform online banking transactions. The gender divide is particularly stark, with only 14.5% of rural women aged 15-29 being able to perform these tasks. The report also underscores large state-wise disparities, with states like Goa and Kerala performing much better than regions such as Meghalaya and Tripura, where less than 10% of young people can complete these basic digital tasks. These findings reflect not only on the digital gap but also raise concerns about how this divide may be impacting the quality of education in different parts of India. While the national average of students who can browse the internet, send emails, and conduct online transactions stands at a mere 28.5% in the 15-29 age group, some states show relatively better performance. Goa leads with 65.7% of young people being able to perform these tasks, followed by Kerala (53.4%), Tamil Nadu (48%), and Telangana (47.2%). Here is a look at the state-wise internet skill levels of the Indian population. On the other end of the spectrum, Meghalaya has the lowest share (7.5%) of individuals capable of using these essential digital skills, followed by Tripura (8.2%), Chhattisgarh (11.9%), and Uttar Pradesh (16%). This disparity not only reflects varying levels of internet access but also reveals significant gaps in digital literacy and educational opportunities between states. The digital divide in India, as reflected in these statistics, highlights the urgent need for improving digital literacy across the country. Without this, many students risk being left behind in the rapidly evolving world of technology and education. The internet is a powerful tool that can drastically enhance the quality of education in several ways. Here are a few ways in which digital literacy can contribute to improved education: The internet provides access to a wide array of resources that students can use for self-study. Educational websites, research papers, and online libraries offer information on every subject imaginable. This access can supplement traditional classroom learning and provide students with in-depth knowledge. Online platforms can provide personalised educational experiences. Adaptive learning technologies help students focus on their weaknesses and strengths, offering tailored resources to help them understand complex subjects at their own pace. The internet facilitates collaboration between students, teachers, and experts from across the globe. Students can participate in forums, share ideas, and collaborate on projects with their peers, enhancing their learning experiences and helping them build networks beyond their immediate surroundings.  Many reputed universities and educational institutions offer free or affordable online courses. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other educational platforms such as Coursera and edX provide students in remote areas with the opportunity to access high-quality education, levelling the playing field. With the rapid digitisation of industries, students who are proficient in digital skills have a competitive advantage in the job market. Learning to navigate the internet effectively and mastering online tools is crucial for preparing students for future employment opportunities in a technology-driven world. In the context of a globalised education system and an increasingly competitive academic environment, the ability to browse the internet is indispensable for students. Here are a few reasons why this is so: In an era of globalisation, students in India must compete with their peers worldwide. Access to online resources allows them to keep up with international academic standards, stay informed about global trends, and gain knowledge that is relevant across borders. Browsing the internet helps students carry out independent research, which is essential for academic excellence. In todayâ\\x80\\x99s world, research is no longer limited to textbooks; it involves reading papers, exploring academic journals, and staying updated on the latest developments in various fields. Many students in India prepare for competitive exams, and the internet provides access to past papers, mock tests, and educational resources that can help them succeed. Furthermore, it offers platforms where students can enrol in exam-specific coaching, improving their chances of success. With rapid advancements in technology, staying up-to-date with the latest tools and platforms is essential. From learning coding languages to mastering digital tools, the internet provides a wealth of resources that are critical for students in technical and scientific fields. Regular browsing of the internet exposes students to diverse viewpoints and problem-solving approaches. By interacting with different sources of information, students can develop critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential for both academic and professional success.\",\n",

The programme, specifically designed for 25 newly recruited women welders from Praj GenX, is probably a first-of-its kind initiative in Mangaluru and Karnataka, said Vijesh V, associate professor at NMAMIT\\'s department of mechanical engineering.  \"Praj GenX conceptualized the idea of hiring women welders and selected the participants as interns. Upon completing the training, all participants will be hired by Praj GenX,\" said Vijesh, and stressed the growing opportunities for women welders in the modern industry. Prajwal Shetty, senior manager, admin and liasoning at Praj GenX, said that women welders can bring fresh perspectives and break gender barriers, revolutionizing the skilled workforce. Abbay Pai, regional manager of Fronius India Private Limited, said, \"This kind of initiative will lead to significant societal transformation, paving the way for greater  gender equality  in skilled labour sectors.\" Niranjan N Chiplunkar, principal, NMAMIT, said that the initiative promotes gender diversity and skill development in technical fields.',\n",

She first gained prominence from her show Sapna Babul Ka...Bidaai is on Indian television and is currently captivating viewers with her complex portrayal of  Goddess Kritikayein , a grey character embodying six distinct avatars, in  Chhathi Maiyya Ki Bitiya . The talented actress recently opened up about the challenges and opportunities for women in the Indian entertainment industry, as well as the depiction of  women\\'s roles  on and off screen. Talking about these challenges and opportunities, Sara shared, \"I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in this woman-and-man card. I don\\'t like limiting myself to being defined by gender. Everyone can do anything in life, whether it\\'s work or taking care of the home. Both women and men are powerful beings, and it\\'s all about how you work toward your goals.\" Regarding the depiction of women\\'s roles in the industry, Sara expressed, \"Every story requires a different kind of role and character. If a character is one that a person can evolve with and relate to from their personal life, then it works. If it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t, then it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t.\" In Chhathi Maiyya Ki Bitiya, Sara portrays six avatars of Goddess Kritikayein, with the show heavily relying on  VFX  and magical elements. Speaking about the experience, she shared, â\\x80\\x9cThe magical scenes you see in the show are hilarious to shoot because we have to imagine everything while filming. Most of the time, we end up bursting into laughter.â\\x80\\x9d She also revealed the best compliment she has received for her character, \"During the promo shoot, my director told me that I looked too angelic to be the devil in the show and that I looked really good in this avatar.\" Chhathi Maiyya Ki Bitiya is a touching  family drama  about Vaishnavi (Brinda Dahal), an orphan who sees Chhathi Maiyya (Devoleena Bhattacharjee) as her mother.

       "  'The big yellow machines such as cement mixers used in the construction industry have traditionally been the preserve of men. But last month  Schwing Stetter India , which makes them, turned things on their head. The company launched its first-ever allwomen service centre at  Poonamallee , Chennai, staffed by 17 skilled technicians (all aged between 20 and 25). Itâ\\x80\\x99s an attempt to do in sales and service what it has already kicked off in manufacturing â\\x80\\x93 bring in  gender equality  across its operations, including in blue-collar jobs.  â\\x80\\x9cWe envision having 50% women in our workforce across all divisions by 2047,â\\x80\\x9d says V G Sakthikumar, CMD, Schwing Stetter India. â\\x80\\x9cInspiring the next generation of women engineers and technicians is pivotal to shaping Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s infrastructure landscape, and we want to lead the way,â\\x80\\x9d he adds.  At the new service centre, the all-women team will service and overhaul a range of concrete pumps and mixers. Their responsibilities will include everything from troubleshooting component malfunctions and carrying out preventive maintenance to providing comprehensive machine servicing. Since the inauguration of the service centre, three machines have been serviced, including two seven-cubic-metre transit mixers and one stationary pump.  â\\x80\\x9cThe requirements for the machines have been gearbox and hydraulic system related,â\\x80\\x9d said a member of the Poonamallee team. The work includes taking out workable parts from old machines and re-incorporating them into a new one as part of the refurbishment process.  â\\x80\\x9cThe  all-women service centre  is a testament to our belief in the capabilities of women in manufacturing and infrastructure sectors,â\\x80\\x9d says Sakthikumar. â\\x80\\x9cWe wanted to show that a  construction equipment  company can have part of its operations run entirely by women,â\\x80\\x9d he adds.  The company has also been steadily increasing the number of women in its factory floor operations. â\\x80\\x9cOur new plant at Sipcot Cheyyar started operations in 2021, and already women make up 28% of our factory assembly line,â\\x80\\x9d he says. Of them, 70% are from Tamil Nadu, while the rest are from Kerala, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal.  Currently, welding, assembly line, quality, service, and spares divisions have all become gender neutral. The company also invites top engineering institutions such as VIT, SRM, and Anna University to offer engineering courses and degree certification on its premises, allowing a section of the women workforce to become fullfledged engineers as well.  â\\x80\\x9cThe factory experience with the women workforce has been very good, with one woman employee winning the national award for welding as well,â\\x80\\x9d says Sakthikumar. â\\x80\\x9cWhat we started in production three years ago, we are now expanding to sales and service as well,â\\x80\\x9d he adds.  Will Schwing Stetter have more all-women service centres? The company aims to open similar facilities across India, and the numbers will depend upon customer feedback. â\\x80\\x9cIf the customer experience is good, we will take this concept forward very quickly,â\\x80\\x9d says Sakthikumar.  Like the factory workers â\\x80\\x93 who have a womenâ\\x80\\x99s hostel nearby and company buses for commute â\\x80\\x93 the service centre is also incorporating a women-friendly work environment, from sanitary pad vending machines to the centre itself being conveniently located next to the Tuticorin bypass.  The company provides transportation and other support services, including on-site medical assistance. In the typically macho world of the big yellow machines, the women of Poonamallee are pioneers of sorts.',\n",
       "  'VARANASI: Nearly a year after an  IIT-BHU  student was allegedly gang-raped on the campus, 13 students of the university have been suspended for 15 to 30 days for \"indiscipline\" and \"disruption of the academic environment\" during a protest over the incident last year. BHU spokesperson  Rajesh Singh  said the action was taken on the recommendation of the university\\'s probe committee. The suspension order was issued on Sep 26. Those suspended include members of various student organisations. Protesting the suspensions, a group of students submitted a memorandum to BHU administration on Thursday, demanding immediate revocation of the order. They warned of a protest if the suspensions were not revoked. Terming the university\\'s action \"a vile attempt to intimidate students\", a suspended student said \"we will continue to be vocal on issues of  women\\'s safety  and  gender equality \". Meanwhile, a group of Congress-backed NSUI members claimed they went to the parliamentary office of PM Narendra Modi in Varanasi to submit a memorandum in protest against the suspensions, but the administration refused to accept it. \"We were stopped under govt pressure and the memorandum was not accepted. In protest, we tore the memorandum in front of the administration, and announced that we would be compelled to stage a bigger protest,\" said NSUI\\'s eastern UP president, Rishabh Pandey. Congress, too, condemned the university\\'s move. City Congress president Raghvendra Chaubey alleged that the accused in the gang rape case, out on bail, openly campaigned in the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections for two months, while students protesting against the criminals had been suspended.  The survivor had alleged that she had gone out of her hostel with a friend on the night of Nov 1, when three men came on a motorcycle, forcibly took her to a corner and gagged her after separating from her friend. The accused then allegedly stripped her, made a video of her and clicked photos.Three accused - Kunal Pandey, Abhishek Chauhan and Saksham Patel - were arrested in the case.',\n",
       "  \"Vice President  's husband,  Doug Emhoff , was alleged to have assaulted his ex-girlfriend in a violent altercation, according to three friends who spoke to DailyMail.com. Emhoff reportedly struck the woman so forcefully that she spun around while they were waiting in a valet line after attending a 2012  Cannes Film Festival  event in France. One friend shared that the woman, referred to under the pseudonym ' Jane ', called him immediately after the incident, crying in a cab and recounting the assault. A second friend recalled that Jane had mentioned the violence at the time, and a third noted that Jane first spoke about her relationship with Emhoff in 2014, recounting the full story of the alleged abuse in 2018, coinciding with then-Senator Harrisâ\\x80\\x99s involvement in the Senate hearings concerning Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The three friends, who provided photos and documents to support Jane's story, described the incident in which Emhoff allegedly became enraged over perceived flirting and slapped Jane in the face after they both had been drinking. The friends further revealed that Jane had spoken of Emhoffâ\\x80\\x99s past, including an affair with his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s nanny, which had resulted in a pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage. Emhoff reportedly paid the nanny a settlement and had her sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Despite this, Emhoff continued to present himself in public as an ally to women and a supporter of their rights, which the friends found hypocritical given his alleged past behaviour. Jane's friends felt it was important to bring these allegations to light, as they believed the public deserved to know more about Emhoff's true character, especially in light of his prominent public role and the image of benevolence promoted by the Harris campaign. However, Jane herself has declined to comment on the matter. The alleged incident took place in May 2012 during the Cannes Film Festival in France. Doug Emhoff and his then-girlfriend, referred to as 'Jane', had attended a high-profile event, the Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) Gala Dinner at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes, southern France. After the event, while they were waiting in a valet line, Emhoff allegedly became enraged, believing Jane was flirting with a valet attendant, and slapped her violently across the face. Both had reportedly been drinking at the time. The accusations are being made indirectly by Janeâ\\x80\\x99s three close friends, who have come forward to share what Jane confided to them about the alleged assault. Jane herself, a successful  New York attorney , has not commented publicly. The three friends provided DailyMail.com with corroborating evidence, including photos of Emhoff and Jane together during that time and other communications. They chose to speak out anonymously due to fears of retaliation. Mainstream media has consistently portrayed Doug Emhoff in a positive light. He is frequently described as a 'wife guy' who is deeply supportive of his spouse, Vice President Kamala Harris. Emhoff has cultivated an image of being an ally to women, speaking out against  toxic masculinity  and positioning himself as an advocate for  gender equality . For example, during a recent interview with MSNBCâ\\x80\\x99s Jen Psaki, he was praised for reshaping public perceptions of masculinity. This benevolent image has been carefully nurtured through media interviews, portraying him as a modern, progressive partner and a strong supporter of womenâ\\x80\\x99s rights. These allegations could be damaging to Kamala Harrisâ\\x80\\x99s image as a staunch advocate for womenâ\\x80\\x99s rights and gender equality. Harris has built much of her political identity on supporting women, speaking out against sexual violence, and advocating for victims of abuse. The accusations against Emhoff, however, create a stark contrast between his public image as a supporter of women and the private actions described by Janeâ\\x80\\x99s friends. If the allegations gain wider attention, it could raise questions about Harrisâ\\x80\\x99s credibility as a pro-woman candidate. \",\n",

Opening up about the support she received from her parents, Sangita Ghosh shared, \"My parents, I think, managed that beautifully. They never questioned me about anything and gave me a lot of freedom and liberty, which is why I am where I am today. I\\'m happy in life, and my thinking and outlook have developed in a way that they never drew distinctions between a boy and a girl.\" She further added, \"My brother and I were raised equally. I was never asked to do certain things just because I was a girl, nor was he treated differently. For instance, he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t told to go out and play while I was expected to stay home and focus on other things. It was never like that. I remember playing cricket, kabaddi, and football with the boys. They never imposed restrictions on me because of my gender. Whether it was my studies, wanting to work, or going out, they always trusted me. They never questioned me for coming home late or for having male friends in my circle. Because of the freedom they gave me, I became much more responsible. For that, Iâ\\x80\\x99m incredibly grateful. They allowed me to live my life freely with them, and I feel truly blessed to have such parents.\" The Saajha Sindoor actress also reflected on how relationships between parents and children have evolved. She shared, \"These days, it\\'s common for parents to want to be friends with their children, probably to break that barrier or thaw the ice, or however you\\'d describe it. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure how Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be with my daughter as she grows up. That said, I believe thereâ\\x80\\x99s a very fine line to maintain. You have to be a parent first, before anything else.\" Sangita, who plays Saroj, the stepmother to Gagan (played by Sahil Uppal) in Saajha Sindoor, also discussed the difficult decision she made to leave her daughter behind for the role. \"It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t just about playing a negative character. There were many factors, especially thinking about my daughter. I had to leave her in Jaipur while I travelled to Mumbai, so I wanted to make sure the role was truly worth it.

       "  'NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday took exception to the gender-discriminatory circular of the  West Bengal health department , issued 10 days after a woman doctor\\'s rape-murder on Aug 9 night at the RG Kar Hospital, advising hospitals to limit  women doctors \\' duty to 12 hours and avoid assigning them night duties. A bench of  CJI D Y Chandrachud  and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the West Bengal govt, how a state could impose such restrictions on women doctors when women as pilots and as part of the armed forces are doing duties in the night. \"How can you discriminate against women, and suggest to govt medical colleges and hospitals to assign only 12-hour duty to women doctors, when their male counterparts would be doing 36 hours of continuous duty,\" the CJI-led bench asked. An unflinching advocate of  gender equality  both in his judgments and speeches delivered outside the court, the CJI said, \"Women professionals do not want concession. They want equal opportunity with security. If it is a 12-hour shift, let it be for all resident doctors irrespective of their gender. The state govt must correct this circular.\" Even though the circular was not mandatory but in the shape of an advisory, Sibal and advocate Astha Sharma said the circular will be amended and these two clauses, objected to by the court and the resident doctors, would be withdrawn. The bench cited the SC\\'s judgment in the Anuj Garg case which involved a challenge to the validity of Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act prohibhiting the employment of women on premises (bars) where people consume liquor or intoxicating drugs. In the 2007 judgment, SC ruled that \"instead of prohibiting women employment in the bars altogether the state should focus on factoring in ways through which unequal consequences of sex differences can be eliminated\". \"It is the state\\'s duty to ensure circumstances of safety which inspire confidence in women to discharge the duty freely in accordance with the requirements of the profession they choose to follow,\" SC had ruled. Deprecating the Delhi govt\\'s opposition to employment of women in bars citing the Jessica Lal murder case, SC had had allowed men and women below the age of 25 to take up jobs in bars, saying these youngsters graduate in hotel management courses at the age of 22 or 23 years and cannot be prohibited from taking employment in the relevant industry.',\n",

       "  'National Daughterâ\\x80\\x99s Day is a celebration dedicated to appreciating and honouring the contributions, influence, and impact of daughters in the lives of people. This year, the festival falls on September 22. This nationwide celebration is a tribute to daughters who go the extra mile for their families and become strong figures within them. In a patriarchal society, boys are traditionally seen as the heirs of the family, the gender that will carry forward the family name. However, times have changed, and daughters are no longer seen as a burden but as a blessing for families. People now know that daughters can be relied upon, not just for emotional support but also for financial needs. Daughters bring joy, creativity, compassion, and love to a family. They teach us how to be sympathetic and kind. This day is also a testament to the changing times and the dying of old stereotypes that reduced daughters and women to mere props and decorations.  Gender equality  is a reality and one that wonâ\\x80\\x99t ever be pushed into darkness again. Equality begins right at home. Whether through heartfelt notes, gifts, or wishes, we should all take the time to celebrate the irreplaceable roles of daughters and women in our lives on this day. Here, we have curated 75+ messages, wishes, greetings, and quotes that you can share with your daughters to remind them how proud you are of them. 1.

       "  \"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India,  DY Chandrachud , delivered a powerful keynote address at the  SheShakti  event in New Delhi on September 16, 2024, organized by a media outlet. He emphasized the need for society to move beyond making concessions for women and, instead, to recognize their  entitlements . Addressing the larger issue of  women's rights  and safety,   Chandrachud pointed out that while legal provisions exist to safeguard women's interests in both public and private spaces, changing societal mindsets is crucial for real justice. He opened his address by discussing the broad challenges facing women today, which include the need for equal opportunities and dignity. The CJI stressed that women's rights are not just a women's issue, highlighting how he had personally learned valuable lessons from his female colleagues. CJI Chandrachud referenced the important role women have played in shaping India's rights framework, mentioning feminist Hansa Mehta, who drafted the Indian Women's Charter of Life before the adoption of the Indian Constitution. He further stated that women's equal participation in governance and leadership roles leads to better development outcomes. However, to achieve this, the ongoing issue of gendered domestic labour must be addressed. For true  gender equality , the focus must be on leveling the playing field and understanding women's lived realities, beyond just statistical representation.\",\n",
       "  'By day they are tech professionals and entrepreneurs; by night they are dazzling queens and kings, donning glittering outfits, vibrant wigs, and bold makeup. Meet Hyderabadâ\\x80\\x99s  drag artists  who are trying to make a difference in society by initiating critical conversations â\\x80\\x94 from politics to  gender equality ,  queer rights , and  civic duty  â\\x80\\x94 one performance at a time. Among them is  Patruni Sastry , a 32-year-old IT professional who has been performing as a drag queen since 2018, the same year they came out as non-binary-trans bisexual. On stage, Patruni is popular as Sas. â\\x80\\x9cDrag is an art form that involves dressing in clothing, jewellery, makeup, and wigs of a different gender and performing for entertainment,â\\x80\\x9d Sas explains, carefully blending eyeshadows to perfect their look. â\\x80\\x9cMost individuals turn into drag queens by adopting highly feminine personas, while some performers transform into drag kings with exaggerated male personas.â\\x80\\x9d Sasâ\\x80\\x99 love for makeup and flamboyant clothing dates back to their early days as a trained Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam dancer. â\\x80\\x9cI always loved putting on makeup and wearing exaggerated clothes, but there were limitations in the costumes for male classical dancers compared to female dancers,â\\x80\\x9d they recall. â\\x80\\x9cIt took me a while to come to terms with my identity, and in 2018, I finally came out to my family. My life has completely changed since then. Drag has taught me to go out there and feel completely free and at peace,â\\x80\\x9d adds Sas, whose performances largely hinge on civic duty, issues of the queer community such as adoption, samesex marriages, and more. But off-stage, Sas is a family person. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m married and have a one-yearold son. We lead a normal life. My wife and son even accompany me to all my shows,â\\x80\\x9d they add. Another prominent figure in the cityâ\\x80\\x99s drag scene is Aryan Patra â\\x80\\x94  KHeMaya  on stage. Her story started from begging on the streets of Bhubaneswar to becoming Odishaâ\\x80\\x99s first trans drag artist. Now, sheâ\\x80\\x99s making her mark in Hyderabad. â\\x80\\x9cI left my village at the age of 14 and joined a  transgender community  in Bhubaneswar, where I started begging,â\\x80\\x9d she recounts, her glittering outfit catching the light as she speaks. â\\x80\\x9cI always loved dressing up as a woman, and I saved every bit of money I earned from begging to join a makeup course. From there, I never looked back.  I was always fond of dancing, as Iâ\\x80\\x99m also a trained Odissi dancer. But after joining the trans community, my passion for dance took a back seat.â\\x80\\x9d Inspired by the Indian drag artist and actor Sushant Divgikar, aka Rani Kohinoor, KHeMaya began exploring drag in Bhubaneswar before moving to Hyderabad. â\\x80\\x9cI researched what Sushant was doing and started performing in Bhubaneswar. After moving to Hyderabad, I contacted the drag community here.  I have done over 100 shows to create awareness about the transgender community, their problems like reservation, employment, etc.,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Perfecting her eyeliner â\\x80\\x94 matching each wing with precision â\\x80\\x94 she goes on to explain the significance of KHeMaya. â\\x80\\x9cK stands for Kalingaâ\\x80\\x94the ancient name of my homeland; He represents the identity I was born with; and Maya means the attractiveness of your talent.â\\x80\\x9d According to these artists, Hyderabadâ\\x80\\x99s drag scene is still in its infancy, with only six active performers who bring their art to life during weekends at various stand-up shows, open mics, and queer community events across the country. â\\x80\\x9cCities like Mumbai and Bengaluru have embraced drag on a larger scale, with each city boasting around 20 drag artists,â\\x80\\x9d shares Hephzibah Smith, known as Firangi Local, an entrepreneur and drag king. â\\x80\\x9cDelhi has about as many artists as Hyderabad, while Chennai has two or three.â\\x80\\x9d Smith is relatively new to the drag scene but is determined to make her mark. However, Smith acknowledges the challenges the community faces in Hyderabad. â\\x80\\x9cWhen we talk about drag, people donâ\\x80\\x99t understand what it is.  There are still only a handful of places in the city that allow us to perform.â\\x80\\x9d Sas shares the same sentiment, pointing to the scarcity of opportunities as a reason for the limited number of active drag artists in Hyderabad. Despite these hurdles, Sas and their fellow performers are committed to creating an economy and environment where drag is respected and invested in. â\\x80\\x9cMany people think weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to be too Westernized, but drag has deep roots in Indian culture,â\\x80\\x9d says KHeMaya. â\\x80\\x9cIn Odisha, we have a dance form called Gotipua, where men dress up as women. Even in Lavni, men used to wear Paithani and dance. My grandfather used to tell me that in villages, men played all the female roles, including Sita in the Ramayana. This is an Indian art form, and we will make it big one day,â\\x80\\x9d KHeMaya adds.',\n",

       "  'NEW DELHI: By day, Anil toils in the dingy confines of a  public washroom  in west Delhi, scrubbing away the grime of countless strangers. At night, with the city agleam in light, the 35-year-old descends into darkness - literally and figuratively - to clean sewers, braving the treacherous turns and  toxic fumes .  His story is mirrored in the lives of hundreds of others trapped in a struggle for survival. They juggle multiple jobs, their days a blur of  backbreaking labour , their hope, a few extra rupees at the end of the day. Behind the grimy facade of the public washroom, a clandestine network thrives. Anil and his fellow  sanitation workers  converge to snag the \"off-the-books\" jobs. They seize the fleeting chances to have some extra earnings to send home, often as lifelines to loved ones awaiting sustenance. Each successful sewer-cleaning stint earns them Rs 1,500-2,000. But these workers share a bond of tragedy, having lost many family and friends to toxic sewer gases. The deaths are ironic since the compensation pay-out brings monetary solace to grieving families. When TOI spoke to these workers, their stories were of unimaginable adversities. Anil, for example, lost his mother to an illness when he was merely 12 and this family tragedy compelled him to shoulder responsibilities far surpassing his years. He was forced to abandon his schooling after Class VIII and to undertake various menial jobs in his village in Haryana. All his adolescent dreams of a comfortable urban life rapidly disintegrated to expose him to a fraught existence. After his marriage, Anil relocated to Delhi, where he initially grappled with securing stable employment and toiled as a labourer. It was during this period that his father-in-law, who was engaged in  manual scavenging , exposed him to the grimness of cleaning gutters and sewers in the metropolis. Anil recalls his mother\\'s agony and the financial hardships his family endured, remembering the profound regret etched in his father\\'s eyes - an emotion he ardently strives to shield his own children from experiencing. Regardless of how arduous or perilous the work may be, he willingly descends into the sewer lines to provide for his family, resolute that they should never endure the hunger he faced as a child. On most days, Anil can be found at the public toilet in JJ Colony, Raghubir Nagar, where he has been allocated a small room to share with his family. He harbours dreams of securing a superior job - one that commands respect, offers a dependable income and lessens the incessant worry of whether he will return home unscathed each day. In a shack on Nala Road in the same locality lives Gangaram, a 67-year-old man. After years of toiling as a labourer and being coerced into cleaning gutters and sewers by thekedars, his contractors, he began developing severe health problems and was ultimately diagnosed with tuberculosis. \"I lost my govt identity cards,\" lamented Gangaram. \"I had to move from Noida to Raghubir Nagar after my illness. I\\'m unfit to perform any physical labour now and have to beg on the roads to have enough to feed myself.\" There\\'s a sense of defeat in his voice when he adds, \"With whatever money I got when I worked, I had to buy medicines for myself. But even that has ceased now.\" Asked about manual scavenging and  sewer cleaning , Gangaram\\'s response was, \"When I was younger, I was willing to undertake any work to earn something for that day. I was born in a jhuggi in Dhaula Kuan and will die in a jhuggi here in Raghubir Nagar. What choice did I have from the beginning of my life?\" Gangaram earns a little bit these days acting as a middle-man, connecting those wanting to have their blocked sewers, drains and gutters cleaned with those who are desperate for some money for sustenance.. People who hire such cleaners range from contractors to residents\\' welfare associations, sometimes homeowners with dysfunctional pipelines and gutters. Anil disclosed that if someone wanted their sewers cleaned, word was informally spread and almost any day the hirers would find the person to do their work. The payment rates are not fixed. For whatever sum they are offered, these labourers enter danger zones without safety gear whatsoever, not even masks. Most of the able-bodied labourers in the locality, according to Om Prakash, a 40-year-old caretake of a public toilet, are anyway compelled to do sewer cleaning work by their contractors. These contractors, the sub-surface workers confided, threaten to withhold payment for work if they refuse to go down into the sewers and drains. Om Prakash said that he had also worked in this fashion for more than two decades of his life. He said, \"It\\'s not that the foul smell of the sewers doesn\\'t bother me, but because I am anyway responsible for cleaning toilets in an overpopulated jhuggi habitation with little to no help, barely functioning water pipelines and broken infrastructure, I\\'m resigned to my circumstances. So, cleaning sewers only means I will have some extra rupees in my pocket.\" Next: Matchstick, survival and the desperate need to make some money',\n",

He specifically inquired about the actions taken by all these departments' staff immediately after the incident. He also learned about diarrhoea cases recorded in nearby villages before the outbreak in Gurla. He investigated the response of the Medical Health Department to the outbreak and the medical assistance provided and gathered details on when the first case was reported in Gurla. Lab tests on  drinking water quality  revealed the presence of bacteria responsible for the diarrhoea outbreak. The Special Chief Secretary also inquired about the causes of drinking water contamination in the village. He examined the lab report results following water tests. He checked whether overhead tanks were regularly chlorinated. He questioned Rural Water Supply SE Umashankar about the possibility of contamination in water supplied by the SSR Peta drinking water scheme. He noted that water could be contaminated due to leaks in drinking water pipelines and suggested the immediate replacement of pipelines in drains. He asked how often overhead tanks were cleaned and the stage at which drinking water became contaminated. He learned that  open defecation  was occurring in the village and inquired about the number of families without individual toilets. District Panchayat Officer Venkateswara Rao reported that 180 out of 918 families lacked toilets, and some families with toilets used them for other purposes. He inquired whether the constructed toilets in the village were built with proper design. He also gathered details of sanitation management in the village. He mentioned that raising public awareness, regular chlorination of drinking water sources, changing people's habits, and promoting personal hygiene could prevent the spread of diarrhoea. He visited the Gurla village and inspected the drinking water scheme at SSR Pet in Nellimarla mandal. He also visited the Gurla Primary Health Centre, spoke with patients receiving treatment for diarrhoea, and inquired about medical care.\",\n",

It was like they made dirt a part of their lives,\" he said.  \"The first job of a prime minister is to make the lives of the common man easy. I talked about toilets and sanitary pads, and today, we see the results,\" he said.

Modi also cited studies and reports that underline the positive outcomes of the mission.  An international study has shown that the Swachh Bharat Mission is saving the lives of 60,000 to 70,000 children annually, while a  UNICEF  report indicates that over 90 percent of women feel safer due to construction of household toilets, he said.

It aims to standardise disposal, collection, and transportation across urban areas. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) encourages residents to segregate sanitary waste before disposal, integrating this practice into a broader framework for sustainable  waste management . However, the implementation of these guidelines often places undue pressure on  sanitation workers . In Chennai, waste collection in 12 of the GCC\\'s 15 zones is managed by private operators Urbaser Sumeet and Chennai Enviro Solutions Limited, with further privatisation planned. Supervisors within the GCC and private companies further impose tonnage-based waste collection targets on sanitation workers to achieve the performance goals stipulated in their contracts. For instance, in one of the zones managed by one of the operators, sanitation workers reported their supervisors mandate each worker to bring 5kg-7kg of sanitary pads and nappies daily, with similar targets set for other types of waste, including food waste and plastics. Sanitation workers play a key role in waste management, collecting garbage that should be segregated by households into wet, dry, and  hazardous waste . However, when the public fails to do so, workers must manually sort unsegregated waste on their battery-operated vehicles before transporting it to disposal sites. This hazardous, stigmatised labour often falls on workers from scheduled caste backgrounds. One worker described using her bare hands to collect sanitary waste: \"When I question the practice, I am told it is my job.\" The GCC must urgently address these issues, starting by reviewing the collection targets imposed on sanitation workers. Target-based waste collection, especially under privatisation, focuses on outcomes in simple, quantified terms, ignoring the labour-intensive processes reliant on marginalised workers. Manually segregating waste to meet tonnage requirements is unsustainable, particularly as household-level segregation in Chennai is estimated to be as low as 25%. The safety and health of sanitation workers need urgent attention. Workers handle waste with inadequate protective gear. \"I get two cloth gloves a month but still get cuts from glass,\" says Suresh (name changed), a worker employed with a private operator. \"We need more sturdy gloves to protect us from toxins in wet waste.\" Many buy extra gloves and masks to safeguard themselves and their families. The GCC and private operators must ensure all workers are equipped with proper, high-quality safety gear. The health of sanitation workers must be regularly monitored, with comprehensive preventive care provided. Many workers say they self-medicate with painkillers or alcohol to cope with the unsanitary conditions. A GCC supervisor reported several deaths among workers aged 38-45 due to alcohol overuse. Tuberculosis and asthma are common but often undiagnosed and untreated. Permanent GCC employees have limited health insurance, which covers emergencies but not regular check-ups, and this is at risk with privatisation. Informal workers, meanwhile, lack any health insurance, and none receive adequate preventive care for occupational diseases. The GCC provides one annual vaccine for Tetanus Toxoid (TT) and Hepatitis B. However, a corporation doctor noted that it maintains no health record of the diseases or the treatment received at the urban primary health centres. \"Sanitation workers need health cards and regular health camps to monitor and prevent diseases such as TB and asthma,\" says R Geetha, advisor to the Unorganised Workers Federation. Workers also regularly raise concerns about the lack of water, toilets, and changing facilities at work, along with pay discrepancies and limited pension access. The GCC needs to also ensure consistent waste segregation at source across the city. Segregated waste collection varies, with some neighbourhoods relying on street bins rather than door-to-door collection. The GCC needs to explain to the public why these discrepancies exist. There is also no signage for sanitary waste like nappies and menstrual products at common disposal sites such as bins on vehicles, street bins, or public toilets. While the GCC has been creating awareness on segregating sanitary waste through their information, education & communication (IEC) activities, the lack of signage puts an added burden on the sanitation worker to request menstrual waste at the door-to-door collection or manually sort through the street garbage bins for sanitary waste. The GCC and private operators must clearly communicate this burden to the public. Effective communication through IEC activities will help inform the public about sanitation workers\\' specific waste collection schedules. Workers have notebooks with detailed maps and schedules. Public awareness can help coordinate segregated waste collection. \"We need more awareness on waste segregation,\" says Suresh. \"Otherwise, supervisors blame us for the public\\'s ignorance.\" **Piling Up** - GCC claims to collect 6,150 metric tonnes of waste every day. - Chennai city generates 0.71kg of solid waste per day per capita, the highest per capita amount of waste generated in India according to a 2022 Chennai Circularity Assessment Protocol report. - According to a 2021 govt report, 68% of Chennai\\'s solid waste is generated by residents, 18% by commercial enterprises, 14% by institutions and businesses, and the rest by construction and demolitions.

On the other hand, it received the lowest score of 39 in ensuring  gender equality  (SDG 5), being ranked an â\\x80\\x98aspirantâ\\x80\\x99 state in the parameter.  The percentage of rural households with piped water connections in the state stands at 72.97, according to the report. The percentage of households with an improved source of drinking water in the state stands at an impressive 99.42. The state has also attained 100% coverage in number of toilets installed in households and districts declared open defecation-free. Srikant Tripathy, a former senior official in the rural development department, said the success in ensuring sanitation in rural areas is linked to the proper implementation of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). â\\x80\\x9cUnder the central scheme, major milestones have been achieved,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He said concentrated efforts were made in the villages, which cover more than 60% of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s area. â\\x80\\x9cPublic participation too made a difference in achieving success in proper water supply and sanitation,â\\x80\\x9d he added. The report revealed the stateâ\\x80\\x99s sex ratio stands at 894 per 1,000 males, falling short of the NITI Aayogâ\\x80\\x99s target of 950. The national sex ratio stands at 929. Moreover, the ratio of wage or salary earnings of women to men is 0.59, while 30.3% of married women experience spousal violence, the report said. The ratio of female to male labour force participation is 0.58, and only 60% of women are satisfied with modern family planning methods, it said. There are 216 women per 1,000 men in managerial positions, while the percentage of women with land holdings is a meagre 4.06. Only 50% of women in the state possess mobile phones, the report revealed. Experts attributed the low score in SDG 5 to various factors, including a lack of awareness about initiatives designed for women and girls. Human rights activist Biswapriya Kanungo emphasised the need for the govt to popularise initiatives aimed at women empowerment. â\\x80\\x9cState-specific schemes should be extensively launched for women and girls, particularly in rural areas. There are persistent gaps in education, employment and societal participation for women, which need to be addressed,â\\x80\\x9d the activist said.

While DDA is still corresponding with Municipal Corporation of Delhi to take over the  sanitation services  in these pockets, it has decided to choose agencies to perform these tasks for a year for the convenience of the residents. The project includes the maintenance of 320 high-income group (HIG) multistoryed flats in Pocket-9A by desilting internal sewer lines using super-sucker machines, in addition to cleaning drains. DDA will also assign tasks for day-to-day cleaning, sweeping, and cleaning of internal roads and common areas at Jasola Heights.  An agency will be in charge of the day-to-day maintenance and attend to the complaints related to external and internal services at DDA HIG flats in Pocket-9B for a year. The repair and maintenance of the local shopping centre and a community hall in Pocket 6 are part of the comprehensive project. \"There have been regular complaints from residents regarding the lack of proper cleaning of internal lanes in their flat areas, and we aim to resolve all sanitation issues and make this place a perfect place to live,\" said an official.  In Aug, DDA conducted a survey of the area and decided to completely overhaul the roads, drains and footpaths in Jasola. The authority has finalised a separate proposal for the repair of roads and constructing missing drains and footpaths at District Centre Jasola and in Pocket I and II, with an estimated cost of Rs 3.3 crore.  \"The project will include repairing perennial waterlogging points, damaged roads and constructing missing drains to avoid water accumulation. We will re-invite tenders for the project soon,\" said an official. The project, which will also have another phase, was initiated after discussions with residents welfare associations and residents in the areas.  The open area behind the district centre, near the parking lot, faces the problem of waterlogging and the drain network and footpaths are also missing opposite the centre, the survey stated. The project also aims to provide pedestrian walkways throughout the colony. \"On Church Road, connecting to Jasola Village Road, DDA made concrete stretches around nine years ago. But due to the movement of heavy vehicles and trucks to the sewage treatment plant, it has been damaged in many places, and there has been a long-standing demand to repair it properly,\" an official said. DDA will also reconstruct damaged drains before the road repair till Jasola Sports Complex Road, he added. ',\n",

On Tuesday, a special orientation workshop was held at the municipal office to provide detailed information and training for Swachh Survekshan, one of the largest  urban sanitation  and cleanliness surveys.  To raise awareness about source segregation and waste minimisation, the MCG has hired a private agency. Planned initiatives include zero waste events, water plus initiatives, source segregation, interpersonal communication, waste-to-wealth activities, clean ward competitions, and self-reliant wards. Rakesh Bhatt, an expert from the agency, said his team will provide technical assistance to the MCG, including data collection, fieldwork, document preparation, and information, education, and communication (IEC) activities. \"The agency will focus on educating the public and promoting best practices in  waste management  to reduce overall waste generation in the city. This time, the corporation will ensure maximum citizen participation as part of a public movement,\" Bhatt added.

       "  'In  Gaza , a region devastated by conflict, numerous young children are suffering from serious medical conditions, including   and various skin ailments. These  health problems  are primarily attributed to the  scarcity  of  clean water  suitable for drinking and bathing purposes. The dire situation has left many children vulnerable to preventable illnesses, as the lack of access to safe water sources continues to pose a significant threat to their well-being. The ongoing war has severely impacted the region\\'s infrastructure, making it difficult for families to obtain the clean water necessary for maintaining proper hygiene and health. Gaza\\'s  water infrastructure , including desalination plants and water wells, has been severely damaged since the war with Israel. According to NBC News,  Oxfam International  reported that all desalination plants and 88% of water wells have been destroyed or damaged, along with all wastewater treatment plants and 70% of sewage pumps.  As a result, the available water in Gaza has dropped by 94%, leaving residents with less than 5 litres per person daily. Humanitarian organisations  are working to repair infrastructure, install septic tanks, and distribute clean water and chlorine tablets, but their access to the area is limited.  Residents are forced to consume and bathe in untreated seawater contaminated with sewage, without access to soap or disinfectants. This has led to a significant increase in cases of hepatitis A, acute respiratory infections, acute diarrhoea, jaundice, skin rashes, and scabies. The United Nations has reported efforts to restore electricity to a desalination plant in southern Gaza, which could provide clean water to approximately one million people.  However, the health threats associated with contaminated water continue to escalate, with the  polio virus  being detected in wastewater samples in June.  Although no new cases have been confirmed, the World Health Organization warns of a high risk of polio spreading in Gaza, as the virus can be transmitted through drinking water contaminated with faeces from an infected person. According to health officials, skin diseases are spreading rapidly in Gaza. They attribute this to the deplorable conditions in overcrowded tent camps housing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians, along with the summer heat and the breakdown of sanitation, resulting in pools of open sewage amid Israel\\'s 10-month bombardment and offensives in the territory. The World Health Organization reports that doctors are dealing with over 103,000 cases of lice and scabies and 65,000 cases of skin rashes. The United Nations Development Program says that among Gaza\\'s population of approximately 2.3 million, more than 1 million cases of acute respiratory infections, over half a million cases of acute diarrhea, and more than 100,000 cases of jaundice have been recorded since the war began. Palestinians say that maintaining cleanliness is impossible in the makeshift tents, which are essentially wood frames covered with blankets or plastic sheets, packed closely together over large areas. Over 1.8 million of Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents have been forced from their homes, often relocating multiple times in the past months to escape Israeli ground assaults or bombardment. The majority are now crowded into a 50-square-kilometre area of dunes and fields on the coast with virtually no sewage system and limited water. UN officials report that the distribution of humanitarian supplies, including soap, shampoo, and medicines, has slowed to a trickle because Israeli military operations and general lawlessness in Gaza make it too dangerous for relief trucks to move. \"Israel launched its campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its October 7 attack on southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 350 abducted. Israel\\'s assault has killed more than 39,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities.\"',\n",

With each machine capable of covering a 30-35 km area per day, we are able to cover 1,700km of roads and collect 150 MT of waste. Running short of its requirement, MCD is enhancing the frequency of 52 machines to meet the requirement as per GRAP norms,\" said an official. \"But to ensure city roads more than 60 feet wide are covered efficiently, we need better infrastructure and more machinery. The process for procuring 18 machines has been hindered due to lack of permission from the standing committee for inviting a new agency,\" said the official. On the requirement for the remaining 42 sweeping machines, MCD stressed on adequate funding. \"The matter was discussed in a recent meeting. It was stated that the demand should be shared with Centre as these  mechanical sweepers  are important to clean roads. Right now, we are sweeping with machines alternate days. If cleaning starts on a daily basis, we will need 250 machines. This was calculated after taking into account that some machines may become non-functional due to glitches,\" said the official. For sweeping of internal roads (12 feet wide) that cover 15,582km, MCD has deputed 57,000 sanitation workers. \"They have been asked to wear protective gear to save themselves from dust pollution and sweep twice a day in commercial areas and markets. They collect 8-12 MT of waste per day,\" he added. MCD has also deployed 225 water sprinklers, including 28 mobile machines. \"Of these, 130 are deployed daily and cover 1,400km. We are using treated water for sprinkling,\" said the official. The civic body has also deployed anti-smog guns at 20 sites, including waste-to-energy plants, dumpsites and C&D waste processing units. Moreover, 15 static anti-smog machines are installed at highrises and another 32 at major construction sites. The CAQM advisory has directed executive engineers to incorporate the special terms and conditions in tender documents. For example, all vehicles carrying construction material should be fully covered, and debris must be stored at the site, not dumped on roads, footpaths or in the open. \"Unpaved surfaces and areas with loose soil shall be adequately sprinkled with water to suppress dust. All C&D waste shall be recycled or transported to an authorised recycling facility,\" MCD said. ',\n",

Some areas of the city, which is close to the border with neighboring India, saw 353 millimeters (14 inches) in a matter of hours, the  water and sanitation agency  said. That broke a previous record of 332 millimeters over three hours in the city in July 1980, according to authorities. Pakistan Meteorological Department \\'s (PMD) deputy director, Farooq Dar, described the deluge as \"record-breaking  rainfall \" in the region, according to AFP news agency. Schools and offices remain closed in Lahore At least one person is reported to have died in Lahore after being electrocuted. The city\\'s commissioner has declared a state of emergency in the city, keeping all schools and offices closed for the day. The heavy downpour quickly flooded many streets and rainwater entered some wards in the Jinnah and Services hospitals in Lahore, causing problems for patients undergoing treatment there. An official in Lahore said the government had dedicated all resources to make sure clean-up operations were underway at the hospital and in the city. Elsewhere, the mountainous northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa also saw heavy rainfall the last three days. At least 24 people have died there, according to the provincial disaster management authority. Heavy rainfall is common in the region in the monsoon season between June and September in Pakistan. But the country, especially the south and the north of the country, faced catastrophic rainfall in 2022, with scientists linking the extreme weather event to climate change, or a long-term shift in weather patterns.',\n",

AAP  members said a minimum of Rs 1,300 to a maximum of Rs 3,800 is paid as sanitation allowance per school per month.  \"The allowance paid to schools is too little and it is difficult for any school to get work done for that amount of money. Schools are paid the allowance based on their number of students,\" said Rakesh Hirpara, a member of the MSB.  AAP had demanded an increase in this allowance earlier as well. As the matter remained unresolved, party workers resorted to the demonstration. At the Lakshman Nagar school, 20-odd AAP workers cleaned the school lobby, passage and ground. The passages were washed using water.  \"School No. 98, where we held the protest, gets only Rs 1,400 as its monthly sanitation allowance. Due to this, the school campus, building and toilets are filthy on most days,\" said Hirpara.  AAP workers got complaints from several teachers about how they must do the cleaning on their own. \"We were told by teachers and principals many times that instead of working in a dirty school campus, they do the cleaning on their own. We have been demanding an increase in the allowance, but the municipal authorities are not resolving the issue,\" said Payal Sakariya, leader of the opposition in the SMC.  At a few schools, there are peons who do the cleaning work on a few days, while for the cleaning of toilets, school officials must hire workers.  \"The shortage of teachers is not the only issue at municipal schools. Students are even deprived of the basic need for a healthy study environment,\" added Sakariya. ',\n",

The PCB has implemented a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to ensure optimal air quality in the city in the forthcoming weeks. SN Dwivedi, the regional officer of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board in Indore, said, \"We are monitoring activities that could potentially harm the environment and deteriorate air quality. Industrial units, hotels, and food establishments that rely on coal have been instructed to adopt cleaner fuel alternatives. We have also collaborated with the Indore Municipal Corporation to coordinate our efforts.\" The regional Pollution Control Board has communicated with the Indore Municipal Corporation, requesting the formation of a team of officials in each zone to take action against individuals who engage in open garbage burning. \"We have also issued a public appeal, urging citizens to adhere to best practices and refrain from polluting the air by burning waste in the open. Open waste burning significantly pollutes the air and emits harmful gases that have detrimental effects on human health. The hazardous pollutants released from waste burning affect everyone, particularly the elderly and children,\" Dwivedi said. Furthermore, the PCB has directed the civic body to educate sanitation workers about the harmful consequences of open waste burning and its impact on air pollution. The board has also instructed the authorities to sprinkle water on roads and raise public awareness about air pollution. From April to September, the average Air Quality Index (AQI) in Indore city has ranged between 86 and 55. However, in the last 15 days of October, the average  AQI  has reached 87.

       "  'Belagavi: Around 8.5% of water samples from rural areas in Belagavi District were found unfit for drinking, according to the drinking water and sanitation department. Out of 36,372 water samples tested across various labs and Water Quality Field Testing Kits (WQFTK), 3,013 samples were reported unfit. The alarming results have prompted further scrutiny and action. Every year, the  rural drinking water  and sanitation department conducts tests for water used for drinking at the gram panchayat level. There are five labs in Belagavi district for testing water. Accordingly, this year too, a total of 15,000 water samples were collected from the water bodies that people depended on for drinking from more than 500 village panchayats of Belagavi district. Out of this, 8,056 samples were collected and tested for water purity and safety, in collaboration with the health department. A total of 668 samples, including 63 samples in Belagavi, 136 in Chikodi, 222 in Savadatti, 220 in Athani, and 27 in Gokak, were found to be impure. Through WQFTK kits, one can measure various chemical constituents of the water sample in the field. Commonly, these samples are analysed in laboratories. On the other hand, a total of 28,316 samples of the district were tested through WQFTK kits by the local GP staff, out of which 25,971 samples were found to be potable and 2,345 samples were found to be non-potable. According to the officials of the rural drinking water and sanitation department, each water sample is tested on a total of 10 parameters, including fluoride, nitrate, chloride, and iron content, to ensure quality. High levels of calcium, magnesium, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, and fluoride in water can cause serious adverse health effects. Therefore, if there is a variation in these limits in the test report, such water is considered impure and non-potable. Due to the risk of contracting diseases like dysentery and cholera by drinking this water, steps have been taken to supply water from alternative sources to the people of this region. A ZP official said that as part of the campaign, samples of drinking water used for cooking and cleaning in schools were tested. Strict instructions have been given to the heads of the respective schools not to use impure water. There are many reasons for water to lose its purity, including climate change, filtration of sewage including drains, and soil quality in pipeline water. ZP CEO Rahul Shinde stated that it is instructed that unfit sources of water should not be used for any reason. Arrangements have been made to supply water from alternative sources with quality water. After a few days, the water sample will be tested again, and action will be taken based on the report.',\n",
       "  ': While Goa improved its composite score by five points to 77, the state remained in its fourth position in  â\\x80\\x99s sustainable development goals (SDG) index for 2023-24. While the state managed to meet most SDG targets, it has been woefully inadequate in reducing   and minimising waste, the report said. Goa remains just two points shy of the top post, bagged by Uttarakhand with 79 points out of 100. NITI Aayog has categorised Goa as a frontrunner in achievement of the  sustainable goals , the same tag that the state bagged in the previous 2020-21 edition, when Goa stood fourth with 72 points. The  SDG index  ranks the  performance  of states based on achievements in 16 goals. States are given a goal-wise score for progress made in each parameter and are classified as achiever, frontrunner, performer, and aspirant, with this being the lowest rung. A state can bag the achiever status only after meeting 100% of the targets set in each of the 16 goals. According to NITI Aayogâ\\x80\\x99s SDG India index 2023-24 report, Goaâ\\x80\\x99s strong point remains access to  clean water  and sanitation. However, the stateâ\\x80\\x99s low score in promoting green economy and sustainable infrastructure played a role in preventing the state from breaking into the top three ranks. Goa is the top performer among states and the only one to achieve 100% towards the SDG 6, clean water and sanitation. Two states â\\x80\\x94 Tamil Nadu and Goa â\\x80\\x94 achieved the national target of 100% access to basic infrastructure (electricity and drinking water). When it comes to SDG 12, which focuses on promoting resource efficiency, green economies, and sustainable infrastructure, Goa has the lowest score among states, with a score of 47. One of the reasons for Goaâ\\x80\\x99s poor showing in SDG 12 is the fact that Goa generated the highest waste with 18.9 tonnes of plastic per annum, followed by Telangana which generated 12.6 tonnes per annum, per 1,000 population. Goa also consumed the most fuel of 526kg per capita. For Goa to improve its score, the state needs to halve its per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030, and reduce food wastage. Plastic waste generation and fossil fuel consumption also need to be drastically reduced, the report suggests. The NITI Aayog report has also recommended that Goa, which has only 3.5% of its area under aquaculture, needs to focus on aquaculture development along its coastline.',\n",
       "  'VADODARA: The flood here last month seems to have left behind disease after the water receded. Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) teams have been pressed into action to ensure timely  medical aid  is available to citizens of affected areas.  With nearly a quarter of the city under floodwater, sanitation and the risk of an outbreak had become a major concern. Cleaning of affected areas was prioritized and home minister  Harsh Sanghavi , who is also the minister in charge of Vadodara, visited the affected areas when they were being cleaned.  Cases of  waterborne diseases  - particularly  acute diarrhoeal disease  (ADD) - have been rising consistently.  In the aftermath of the flood, these numbers rose by more than three times on certain days, compared to before the flood. Between Aug 21 and 27, this number was between 43 and 70 cases. After the flood, the numbers rose to as high as 194 on a single day, Sep 2. Till Sep 10, the daily number of ADD cases remained over 101.  VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said all efforts were made to ensure there was no major outbreak. \"The high number is also because our teams actively went on surveys in these areas and camped there to ensure all sick people got treatment and that preventive measures were in place,\" he said.  Patel added that the number of cases is also higher because more cases were being identified and enumerated by VMC teams. \"Earlier, such patients may have never approached a doctor and hence were not part of the data,\" Patel added. The numbers have started going down again significantly since last week.  Sources said the increase was expected as water gets contaminated and living conditions are unsanitary in the immediate aftermath of floods. \"Floodwater has sewage and other contaminants in it, which causes this situation,\" an official said.

He stated that the encroachment of irrigation canals resulted in such massive damage to the city. He said that the supply of food and essentials would continue for a few more days as the people were struggling to come to terms with the situation. He assured that the govt would be with them until they completely recovered. He mentioned that essential commodities kits would also be supplied to each and every household. Additionally, they were supplying vegetables and drugs to the households. He said that chief minister Chandrababu Naidu directed them to supply food packets five times the actual number of victims to ensure that there is no shortage. He noted that the situation in some of the lanes in Singh Nagar, Old RR Pet, New RR Pet, Indira Nagar, and Payakapuram was still grim as water had yet to recede. He assured that flood water would completely recede by Monday. â\\x80\\x9cWe will clean all the houses within 24 hours of the flood water receding in the colony. The fire services teams are working overtime to clean the colonies and houses,â\\x80\\x9d said Narayana.

       "  'In Brondo in the southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), accessing  clean water  is essential for survival. Despite enjoying rich rainfall for much of the year, the region lacks proper water treatment. For residents like Betty, access to  sanitation  and treated water therefore is extremely limited. \"We drink the unclean water. There are overflowing septic tanks and rainwater that brings the city\\'s garbage into the houses,\" Betty told DW. Health experts have issued renewed warnings about surging cholera cases in the region. The disease is spreading rapidly in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and the DRC, with neighboring countries keeping a watchful eye on their borders. Yet most longterm remedies against the outbreak are to be found at the local level. In Zimbabwe, the situation has reached a critical point. Since the beginning of the outbreak, more than 22,000 cases and over 450 deaths have been repoted. Doctors have criticized a lack of awareness about preventive measures among communities. \"People are not keen on treating borehole water,\" Michael Vere, an epidemiologist at Harare Central Hospital, said in reference to water extracted through narrow shafts bored into the ground. \"They assume that borehole water is safe, but the water is not safe.\"  In Zimbabwe\\'s capital, the issue is further exacerbated by the population density in certain areas, such as the Highfield suburb. Communities are now facing a shortage of safe playing areas for children, as raw sewage continues to flow in backyards and on the streets. Chiedza Zulu, a concerned mother of four, summarized the fear that has been gripping the community. \"Cholera cases are cropping up around us. We now keep oral hydration salts in case we contract the disease. Sewage is flowing, and refuse is not being collected. Flies, rodents, and mosquitos are plenty here. This is unbearable,\" she told DW. Vere emphasized the importance of addressing inadequate water and sanitation conditions to protect local residents. \"We encourage people to treat all water, regardless of source,\" he said. With suspected and confirmed cases reported in 61 out of 64 districts, Zimbabwe\\'s government has now taken action to address the outbreak head-on. Health authorities have set up 153 cholera treatment centers and have initiated a cholera vaccination campaign. However, a global shortage of the cholera vaccine has been hampering Zimbabwe\\'s efforts to vaccinate a large portion of its population. Douglas Mombeshora, Zimbabwe\\'s Health and Child Minister, said the vaccine was not a quick fix for ending the cholera crisis. \"The vaccine is not an end to cholera,\" Mombeshora told reporters. He added that it rather amounted to \"a temporary response which should be complemented with tangible investment in safe water provision.\" According to a UNICEF report, Zimbabwe is facing a shortage of investment in water and sanitation infrastructure. As a result, only about one in three households have access to treated water sources and sanitation. Mozambique appears to be in a similar situation as Zimbabwe, with around 40,000 cholera cases and 151 resulting fatalities reported so far. However, Mozambique\\'s numbers reach as far back as September 2022, marking a slow march towards endemic propotions. Similarly, the DRC is also currently grappling with a longer-lasting  cholera outbreak . Despite ongoing efforts to strengthen disease surveillance and response activities, there have been nearly 300 cholera cases recorded in the DRC\\'s southeastern Haut-Katanga province since the beginning of the year. Albert Tambwe, director of the School of Public Health at the University of Lubumbashi, attributes the rise in cases to overall unsanitary conditions. \"The conclusion is that our water is indeed 52% contaminated, but with salmonella and other germs,\" he said, highlighting the daily struggle people face whenever they turn on their taps. Tambwe, however, added that there wasn\\'t any notable rate of cholera bacteria in the water â\\x80\\x94 yet. Meanwhile in neighboring Malawi, there have only been 58 cholera cases reported so far. However, health experts are calling on the government to nevertheless allocate more funds towards water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs, and not be appeased by lower case numbers compared to its neighbors. Maziko Matemba, a public health expert in Malawi, highighted the need to improve access to safe and clean water in a bid to curb the spread of the disease. \"If it is not well supported in terms of buying commodities and other necessities, I think it will be challenging,\" Matemba told DW. The Ministry of Health in Malawi has actively been monitoring the disease since the start of its national campaign to end cholera in 2023. Adrian Chikumbe, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, says the government has a comprehensive set of measures aimed at containing the spread in place, including intensified communication efforts and enhanced surveillance. Matemba believes this is not enought. He underscored the magnitude of the persistent cholera risk in Malawi, and cited factors like limited access to clean water and the urgent need for substantial support in terms of resources as solutions to a \"ticking time bomb.\" Malawi\\'s Minister of Water and Sanitation Abida Mia believes that it is not so much the quality of the water itself but rather its use that needs be highlighteed in campaigns. She believes that promoting better hygiene practices are key components of the ongoing efforts to combat the disease. \"Hygiene is the main problem that we are facing regarding the spread of cholera,\" she told DW. In response to the escalating health crisis, leaders of the intergovernmental organization the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have devised a collective strategy to combat cholera. They have pledged to increase investment in water and sanitation infrastructure in the region. \"The public health crisis plaguing our region poses a serious threat to sustainable development and the well-being of our peoples,\" said Angolan President Joao Loureco, who currently chairs the rotating presidency of SADC. \"Cholera knows no borders and requires a regional approach to address it,\" Loureco added. In a virtual summit, SADC leaders agreed to provide efficient waste management and a sustainable supply of clean water. They also recognized that at least 40 percent of the region\\'s population lacked access to safe water.',\n",

       "  'KATHMANDU: Nepal\\'s House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the membership of the  International Solar Alliance  that will help the Himalayan nation increase usage of  solar power  in its effort to combat the impact due to changing climate. The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against  climate change  through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.   With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.   Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as  clean energy  is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.   \"The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal\\'s development,\" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.   A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.   Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government\\'s move as he said, \"This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.\"   Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal\\'s Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power.',\n",

       "  'In the race to combat climate change, India is emerging as a dark horse contender to become a global  green energy powerhouse . With ambitious targets, innovative technologies, and a diverse energy portfolio, the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most populous country is positioning itself at the forefront of the  renewable energy revolution . As nations worldwide grapple with the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s multifaceted approach to green energy development is garnering attention. â\\x80\\x9cIndia has set an ambitious net zero goal to achieve by 2070,â\\x80\\x9d says Sanjukta Subudhi, associate director of microbial  biofuels  and biochemicals at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). As Sanjukta puts it, all forms of green energy molecules  solar , bio-based, hydrothermal, and other biomolecules are seen to play a key role in achieving this net zero goal. One of the cornerstones of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s green energy strategy is its push for biofuels, an energy source that gets far too little attention. The country has rolled out several programs, including the ethanol blending program and the SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme, aimed at increasing the production and use of biofuels. Sanjukta says India has set a target of achieving 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2030, which will cut down our dependence on costly and polluting fossil fuels. The development of biofuels in India goes beyond just ethanol. Researchers are exploring various sources of biomass, including agricultural waste, forest residues, and even coconut fibre, to produce a range of biofuels and valuable byproducts. Sanjay Kumar Kar, professor at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, says this diversified approach is the only way a country as large as India can effectively utilise its natural resources to cut oil imports. While biofuels represent a significant portion of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s green energy portfolio, solar and  wind power  are leading the charge in terms of installed capacity. According to Bragadesh Damodaran, VP and energy transition & utilities industry platform leader at Capgemini India, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s installed renewable energy capacity has surpassed 180 gigawatts as of 2024. â\\x80\\x9cIndia has set an ambitious target of achieving 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030, including 280 gigawatts from solar and 140 gigawatts from wind,â\\x80\\x9d Bragadesh said. This massive expansion plan in renewable energy infrastructure is attracting substantial investments from both domestic and international sources. Perhaps the most exciting development in Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s green energy landscape is its foray into green hydrogen production. The National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to pro duce at least 5 million metric tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030, with the potential to double that figure. â\\x80\\x9cBy 2030, India will emerge as the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest producer and exporter of green hydrogen, revolutionising global energy markets and positioning itself as a central hub in the global transition to a low-carbon economy,â\\x80\\x9d says Bragadesh. However, Sanjay also points out the challenges, particularly the troubling water-energy nexus. â\\x80\\x9cWe require clean water for production of hydrogen, and that is a scarce resource in most parts of this country.â\\x80\\x9d To address this issue, researchers are exploring a range of solutions, such as producing hydrogen from saline water. This could be a game-changer for coastal refineries that lack access to fresh-water resources.',\n",
       "  'NORTH CAROLINA: Vice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Michael Regan on Thursday announced eight organizations that will oversee the spending of $20 billion in grants to fund tens of thousands of  clean energy  and  transportation projects  in disadvantaged communities across the United States.  \"While every community has the capacity to join the  clean energy economy , not every community has had the opportunity to do that,\" Harris said at an event on Charlotte announcing the grantees, adding that the funding reflects two  Biden administration  priorities - expanding access to capital and building a clean energy economy.  The $20 billion, made available through the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) created in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, will largely be invested in projects ranging from home energy retrofitting programs to off-grid renewable energy in communities that have not had access to green financing.  The selected organizations will create a national clean financing network that will help kickstart projects over the next seven years that are expected to reduce or avoid up to 40 million metric tons of climate pollution annually.  Harris and Regan visited a home in the historically black neighborhood of Grier Heights in Charlotte, North Carolina, where homeowner has used the type of financing that will be made available through the GRRF to retrofit his home heating and energy systems to make it more efficient and affordable.  A local nonprofit, Self-Help, that helped him access funding years ago to retrofit his home, co-leads one Climate United, one of the eight organizations selected to distribute federal funding to help replicate the types of retrofits that have been happening in Grier Heights.  The EPA plans to get the money to the organizations by September this year. The GGRF has been a target of congressional Republicans, who passed a resolution this year attempting to repeal what they have called a climate \"slush fund.\" Three non-profit coalitions comprised of community development financial institutions, local green banks and other community lending organizations were chosen to distribute $14 billion from a National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), that aims to support affordable clean technology projects nationwide.  Another five groups have been chosen to administer the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which will provide funding and technical assistance to community lenders working to back clean technology projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities.  Harris said this was the first time federal dollars will be directly given to local non-profit organizations, who she said were best placed to make investments in their local communities.  Of the $20 billion, at least $4 billion will be dedicated to investment in rural communities and $1.5 billion will be directed to programs benefiting tribal nations.  The grantees are expected to mobilize almost $7 of private capital for every $1 of federal funds they spend.  William Barber, head of the Coalition for Green Capital - one of the selected organizations, said it was fitting that the announcement took place on the anniversary of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, and said the funding will help the US face the \"fierce urgency of climate change.\"  \"Climate change is no longer a distant threat but an accelerating reality,\" said Barber, who said the awards will unlock the power of private and public capital to help all communities be able to help tackle the issue.',\n",

       "  \"KHAVDA: AdGreen Energy Limited (AGEL), has operationalized the first 250 MW wind capacity at the world's largest 30,000 MW  renewable energy  plant located in  Khavda ,  Gujarat . According to a press release, this brings the cumulative operational capacity at the Khavda plant to 2,250 MW, reinforcing AGEL's leadership with a total operational portfolio of 11,184 MW across India. Wind energy  plays a crucial role in India's energy mix, ensuring a continuous supply of renewable energy by complementing solar power generation, which occurs during the day, with wind power, which is typically harnessed at night. Additionally, wind energy aids in grid stability by diversifying energy sources and, when paired with storage solutions, strengthens the renewable energy baseload. Khavda boasts some of the best wind resources in India, with wind speeds averaging around 8 meters per second, making it an optimal location for wind energy generation. The Khavda Renewable Energy plant is equipped with some of the world's largest and most powerful onshore wind turbine generators (WTG), each with a capacity of 5.2 MW. These high-capacity WTGs enable efficient land use, resulting in higher energy yields and reduced levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The 5.2 MW turbines feature a rotor diameter of 160 meters and a tip height of 200 meters, equivalent to the height of the Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue located in Gujarat. These WTGs are manufactured using advanced German technology at Adani New Industries Limited's (ANIL) integrated manufacturing ecosystem near the Mundra port, showcasing AGEL's commitment to building an indigenous supply chain and supporting the 'Made in India' initiative. AGEL has transformed the barren wasteland of Khavda into a hub of clean and affordable energy, capable of powering 16.1 million homes annually. With its proven expertise in developing ultra-large-scale renewable projects, a robust supply chain network, and technological prowess, AGEL is well-positioned to construct this unparalleled giga-scale plant in the global clean energy sector. AGEL conducted extensive studies and implemented numerous innovative solutions to expedite the development of the plant. In doing so, it supports the development of an indigenous and sustainable supply chain. The world's largest renewable energy plant at Khavda stands as a beacon for accelerating global decarbonization efforts and advancing India's sustainable development. AGEL, with support from its ecosystem of vendors, is developing the world's largest renewable energy project on barren land at Khavda in Kutch, Gujarat. Spanning 538 sq km, it is five times the size of Paris and nearly as large as Mumbai. Upon completion, it will be the largest power plant on the planet, irrespective of energy source. The region boasts approximately 2,060 kWh/m2 of high solar irradiation and some of the best wind resources in India, with wind speeds of around 8 meters per second. Before developing this site,  Adani Green  conducted geotechnical investigations, seismic studies, a centrifuge study by Cambridge, resource assessment and land studies, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD), and a detailed feasibility study over five years. The comprehensive infrastructure development included constructing approximately 100 km of roads, 50 km of drainage, desalination, and three reverse osmosis (RO) plants with a total capacity of 70 cubic meters per hour to meet the drinking water needs of project staff. Additionally, they laid 180 km of optical fibre cables for connectivity and built concrete batching plants. A township was also created to accommodate over 8,000 staff and workers, complete with medical facilities, a shopping complex, banking services, and leisure activities. The rapid development of this giga-scale project requires the combined strength and expertise of specialized partners within and outside the Adani portfolio. Which includes, supply of the largest onshore wind turbine manufactured by Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL), transmission network developed by Adani Energy Solutions (AESL), solar trackers from Jash Energy, cement and concrete from ACC and Ambuja Cements, logistic solutions from Adani Ports and SEZ (APSEZ), project execution, assurance, and management by Adani Infra India Limited (AIIL), digitally enabled operations by Adani Infrastructure Management Solutions Limited (AIMSL), Adani utility portfolio's globally recognized Energy Network Operation Centre (ENOC). Our indigenous supply chains and strong vendor networks are pivotal in realizing the world's largest renewable energy plant. The plant will feature cutting-edge technology, including India's largest onshore wind turbine generators of 5.2 MW capacity, bifacial solar PV modules (which generate energy from both sides of the module), and horizontal single-axis tracker systems (which track the sun for more energy). Additionally, it will use Adani's state-of-the-art Energy Network Operation Centre (ENOC) platform with AI and ML integration for real-time automated operation and monitoring. AGEL's partner Adani Infra is developing innovative solutions to address terrain challenges at Khavda. For example, they have deployed underground stone columns to enhance soil strength, developed with global collaboration involving both domestic and international institutions. Specialized corrosion-resistant coatings are also being used for solar module mounting structures and switchyard equipment to ensure long-term protection in highly corrosive environments. AGEL is engaged in community development initiatives across several villages, focusing on education, health, women empowerment, water conservation, and enhancing community infrastructure as part of its ESG efforts. \",\n",

The CM pointed out his govtâ\\x80\\x99s commitment in ushering in a new era of industrial development, focusing on creating new opportunities, jobs and a modern Odisha that excels in every field.  He underscored the stateâ\\x80\\x99s swift transition from resource-based industries to skill-driven sectors such as IT, electronics manufacturing, textiles, food processing, chemicals, petrochemicals and renewable energy. Majhi assured investors of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s robust industrial infrastructure and a whole-of-govt approach to facilitate ease and speed of doing business.  He also emphasised the synergy between the state and central govts, with Odisha aligning perfectly with programmes like the  PLI scheme , National Infrastructure Pipeline and  Gati Shakti , creating a seamless business environment. He appealed to industries to set up employment- intensive units in Odisha, promising the best and most efficient manpower to work for them. Majhi assured a peaceful and safe environment for businesses to operate and invited investors to partner with Odisha in its journey to wards becoming a 'viksit' (developed) state. Chief minister Mohan Majhi also highlighted recent initiatives taken by his govt, such as the development of garment manufacturing clusters, food processing parks and multi-modal logistics hubs, which will strengthen Odisha's position in the global supply chain.

It is the highest growth for any economy in Asia. It may be possible to grow faster but the main thing is not to focus on any number, just continue to think about how the basic environment for business can improve. All the fundamentals are good, India is enjoying demographic dividend and there is a lot of positive sentiment among consumers and investors. Employment is an important issue. The good thing is poverty and inequality have reduced. If you try to create more jobs for less skilled sectors, then you will need to support more labour-intensive manufacturing and sectors where you have comparative advantage. The success of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat is the right way, and we should think how more states can do it. There may be some truth to that, but I am not sure if it affects our strategy, labour-intensive sectors still create a lot of jobs. Even as employment opportunities in manufacturing have a lower ceiling than in the past, opportunities in the services sector have increased because digitization is making services trade much more feasible. India has benefited from that... the only concern is that they tend to be more skill intensive. India should be pushing on all fronts. There are a lot of synergies between manufacturing and services. There is no rule about how much you should be producing in a global economy. If you think it reflects unfair trade practices, we have the WTO principles to guide us on what justifies countervailing or anti-dumping duty. Countries, rather than politicise trade, should stick to these principles and do due diligence and impose what is appropriate. We have seen shifts in FDI and trade flows. Countries that benefit the most are also the ones that are very competitive producers. Countries with a good investment environment have benefited, Vietnam, India, to some extent, Mexico due to proximity to the US. India and Indonesia also benefit from being big markets. It's an opportunity, especially, if it gives a foothold into new sectors, semiconductor chains, anything related to green transition. For India to maximise the gains, it needs to provide a very attractive investment environment, which can be improved over time. Just giving subsidies is not going to be sustainable. Security is a non-economic factor and govts must decide their priorities. From an economic standpoint, you should minimise restrictions.

They are keen to come and experience the incredible transformation first hand. \"I have been visiting India since 2008, and this is my fifth trip. I have witnessed a remarkable transformation in the country since 2015, with rapid economic growth and development,\" he said. Reflecting on Rotary\\'s significant expansion in India, Camargo highlighted the remarkable increase in membership over the past decade. \"Rotary membership in India has more than doubled in the last few years, making it the fastest-growing country for the organisation. India now boasts the highest absolute growth in the Rotary world,\" he said.  In addition to membership growth, India has also solidified its position as a major contributor to Rotary\\'s global initiatives. \"India has emerged as the second-largest fund-raiser for Rotary after the USA,\" Camargo revealed.  \"The country\\'s fundraising efforts have surged from $6 million in 2014 to a remarkable $33 million in 2024, and we anticipate this figure to exceed $35 million in 2025,\" he said. Camargo, who himself was a Rotary Youth Exchange student in his youth, holds a special fondness for the programme. \"Youth exchange is a cornerstone of Rotary. Our goal is to revitalise the programme to its pre-pandemic levels, where over 8,000 young people participated annually,\" he said. Addressing the need for younger members, Camargo emphasised the importance of succession planning for Rotary clubs worldwide. \"The average age of many clubs is over 70, which is a concern. We need to attract more young people to ensure the continuity of Rotary\\'s valuable work,\" he noted.

Patel launched the EMP for SER on Thursday in the presence of political, business and industry leaders from the region. The EMP for SER, prepared by  , includes Surat and its adjoining districts of Bharuch, Valsad, Navsari, Tapi and Dang. It focuses on growth of not only business and industrial activity but also education, tourism, agriculture and the environment.  While launching the plan, CM Bhupendra Patel said, \"The region will play a crucial role in making the state a $3.5 trillion economy by 2047 and create 34 lakh new jobs.\" Beginning his speech, Patel said, \"You have clapped a lot, Gujarat is the growth engine of the country, and Gujarat\\'s growth engine is Surat. Now, after clapping, it is the responsibility of all sitting here to ensure that the vision document is realized on the ground. The govt is with you,\" Patel said in his address. He further said, \"India became a global economic power under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, and now in his third term, he has given direction through  growth hubs  to make India the third-largest economic power in the world.\" Along with Surat, NITI Aayog has identified Mumbai, Varanasi, and Visakhapatnam as growth hubs. \"While the  manufacturing sector  contributes 36% to the state\\'s  , it contributes 55% to Surat\\'s GDP. At the foundation of this achievement lie traditional industries like textiles, gems and jewellery, diamonds, and chemicals and dyes,\" Patel added. Discussing the  economic development  in the past, the CM said, \"For decades following 1960, Gujarat\\'s development activities were limited to the belt from Vapi to Tapi. At that time, there seemed to be no prospects for development in Gujarat, which has seas, deserts, and mountains. There was no place or direction for the development of electricity, water, roads, or infrastructure. However, in the last two decades, Gujarat has picked up the pace of development. Evaluating the development over the two and a half decades since 2001, Gujarat has demonstrated what development should be like, its scale, and its speed.\" In his address, C R Paatil, Union water resources minister, suggested that the NITI Aayog team include the sector of medical instrument manufacturing in its report. \"Though the sector is small, huge investment has been made in it. Business leaders from Surat had to give a bank guarantee of Rs 3 crore to get a flight in the past and soon there will be 100 flights,\" Paatil said. He thanked the govt for allocating Rs 5,000 crore for a deep-sea pipeline to dump industrial effluent. He suggested that the textile policy will be announced soon. \"The PM said that every state should prepare a vision document and with the support of NITI Aayog, Gujarat is the first state to make a vision document,\" said B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO of NITI Aayog. Explaining the growth hub concept, he said that to realize the $30 trillion economy target, cities will be growth engines. \"Nearly 1.5 crore people live in SER, comprising six districts, and its GDP stands at $72 billion, nearly 25% of Gujarat\\'s gross domestic product. This region holds great potential, and that is why we have chosen it under the G-HUB initiative,\" he said. The SER is already a diamond, textiles and chemicals hub, but its tourism and agro-processing potential is still untapped, he said. \"We are aiming to lift the SER\\'s GDP from the present $72 billion to $1.3 trillion by 2047, when India will be celebrating 100 years of Independence,\" Subrahmanyam said.',\n",

In an interview with news agency PTI, the former RBI governor acknowledged the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s intentions behind the \\' \\' initiative, which was launched on September 25, 2014, saying that while infrastructure improvements are commendable, other sectors require attention. \"But we need to check the other places. And the best way to check is to ask critics, what do you think? What has happened? Has it happened the way you want it? Should we do more? You get feedback, and then you work along,\" Rajan said. When asked about India\\'s  economic growth  target, Rajan noted that a 7% growth rate could potentially position India ahead of Germany and Japan in a few years, given that their economies are currently valued at approximately $4.5 trillion and $4.2 trillion, respectively.  \"If you see that, then you put a 7 per cent growth rate, and you find it is not enough to become USD 15,000 per capita GDP by 2047 we need to do better,\" Rajan said. When asked about India\\'s economic growth target, Rajan noted that a 7% growth rate could potentially position India ahead of Germany and Japan in a few years, given that their economies are currently valued at approximately $4.5 trillion and $4.2 trillion, respectively.  \"What is more worrisome, however, is when we say a developed nation. Now, what does it mean to be developed now? That is also a changing metric,\" the former governor said. He also talked about the importance of simplifying business regulations, reducing the fear of inspections, and creating a more conducive environment for entrepreneurs. Additionally, he cautioned against dismissing criticism of government policies as stemming from vested interests.

       "  'MUMBAI: Coordination between   and govt has helped bring down the trade-off between battling  inflation  and growth, RBI governor  Shaktikanta Das  said. RBI has steadfastly maintained that there is no trade-off between growth and inflation in the long term, as low inflation is a prerequisite for sustainable growth. However, its monetary action to curb inflation, besides dampening demand, also has an immediate impact on growth. According to Das, experiences in the aftermath of the pandemic have shown how coordinated monetary and fiscal policies can have better economic outcomes. \"During the pandemic, central banks worked in close coordination with govts to deal with the unprecedented crisis. Later, when central banks were battling against multi-decade high inflation, govts took measures on the supply side to ease inflationary pressures. Consequently, the output sacrifice needed to bring down inflation was minimised,\" said Das. He was delivering the First Himalaya Shumsher Memorial Lecture at Nepal Rastra Bank in Kathmandu on Tuesday. To soften the impact of the lockdown, RBI had infused liquidity to the tune of over Rs 5.5 lakh crore, which reduced the stress on businesses. Subsequently, when RBI was forced to hike interest rates in 2022 to cool inflation, govt took a number of measures to cool commodity prices that were seeing price spikes. In his speech, Das said that the model for central banking has changed over the last decade. While earlier central banks were focused on price stability as a sole objective, they now have a broader mandate that includes sustained growth and financial stability in addition to price stability. \"The trade-off between price stability and growth emerges when the pursuit of price stability entails large growth sacrifice,\" Das added.',\n",

Singh further highlighted the importance of people-to-people connections, especially the growing Indian community in Australia, which is now one million strong. \"The glue between Australia and India is really its people... and those that want to engage in business with India to understand its economic rise,\" she added, pointing to the complementary strengths of both nations in fields such as clean energy and education. Victoria\\'s Premier Jacinta Allan echoed this sentiment, describing the India-Australia relationship as \"incredibly strong\" during her visit to India. Allan pointed out that Victoria hosts the largest number of Indian-born Australian residents and international students, making education a key driver in the bilateral relationship. \"Education is an incredibly important part of our community and economy,\" she said, stressing the significance of ongoing collaboration between Indian and Victorian educational institutions. Allan also highlighted shared economic priorities, particularly in renewable energy, transport infrastructure, and housing, as key areas where India and Australia can work together. She said, \"We have a lot in common in terms of values but also our priority growth areas in terms of renewable energy and building better transport connections.\" The Premier\\'s visit to India also focused on engaging with women leaders to discuss ways to create more opportunities for women in both countries.

       "  'Moody\\'s Ratings on Thursday increased India\\'s GDP growth forecast for the 2024 and 2025 calendar years to 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively, citing strong broad-based growth as a key factor. The ratings agency noted that growth could exceed projections if private consumption gains additional traction. Moody\\'s Ratings highlighted that the Indian economy currently benefits from a blend of solid growth and moderating inflation. This assessment was part of their August update for the Global Macro Outlook for 2024-25. According to Moody\\'s, \"From a macroeconomic perspective, the Indian economy is in a sweet spot, with the mix of solid growth and moderating inflation.\" India\\'s GDP growth is projected to be 7.2% in 2024, a significant rise from the previous estimate of 6.8%. For 2025, Moody\\'s updated the projection to 6.6%, up from the earlier forecast of 6.4%. Moody\\'s stated, \"We have raised our real GDP growth projections for the Indian economy for 2024 and 2025...These forecast changes assume strong broad-based growth.\" The Indian economy showed a year-over-year expansion of 7.8% in the first quarter of 2024, despite the challenges posed by tight monetary policies and ongoing efforts toward fiscal consolidation. Moody\\'s pointed out that signs of a revival in  rural demand  are emerging, bolstered by improving  agricultural output  prospects due to above-normal rainfall during the monsoon season. Bank and non-financial corporate balance sheets are in a much healthier state compared to pre-pandemic levels. Companies are also increasingly turning to equity and bond markets to raise capital. Additionally, a recent paper by the RBI forecasts a 54% surge in private capital expenditure for the current financial year. Moody\\'s said, \"The capex cycle should continue to gain steam amid rising capacity utilisation, upbeat business sentiment and the government\\'s continued thrust on infrastructure spending.\" Supporting these growth dynamics is the rapid and widespread digitalisation of the economy. This is driven by government investments in digital public infrastructure, increased telecom and internet penetration, and low data usage costs. India\\'s external position has also improved in recent years, with a significant reduction in the current account deficit. The quarter ending in March 2024 even registered a modest surplus, the first in 10 quarters, mainly due to robust service exports and strong remittance inflows. Additionally, India\\'s ample foreign exchange reserves accumulated over the past decade provide the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with the capacity to intervene in forex markets to dampen rupee volatility during crises. Moody\\'s noted, \"Over the medium- and longer-term, India\\'s growth prospects depend on how well the country can productively tap its substantial pool of labour... Nevertheless, 6-7 per cent growth should be possible for the economy sheerly on the basis of present conditions.\" India\\'s population has a median age of 28 years, with about two-thirds in the working age group. While employment generation and skill development remain government priorities, the extent to which India can benefit from its demographic dividend will hinge on the effectiveness of these policies.',\n",
       "  'NEW DELHI: India needs an additional 400 million women in the workforce by fiscal year 2047 to contribute $14 trillion to the economy, nearly doubling the current female  labour force participation  rate (LFPR) from 37 per cent to 70 per cent, according to a new report by The/Nudge Institute. According to The Labour Force Participation Distillation Report, based on the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data over the years, only 110 million women are projected to join the workforce by 2047, leaving a gap of 145 million women needed to meet the target. The report reveals significant disparities between men and women in job security and recovery. Women are seven times more likely to lose their jobs and eleven times more likely not to recover from job loss. By 2020, nearly half of the women employed in 2019 had exited the workforce, the report read. Women are predominantly employed in low-productivity sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, where advancement opportunities are limited. In the construction sector, women make up just over 12 per cent of the workforce and often earn less than men in unskilled roles. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened these issues, forcing many rural women back into the workforce due to income loss or job loss by primary earners, highlighting the fragility of female employment. The report identifies three key pathways to increase female labour force participation.  According to PTI, Director & Head of The/Nudge Prize, Kanishka Chatterjee said: \"India\\'s demographic dividend and dreams of a $30 trillion economy cannot be realised without boosting the participation of women in the workforce.\" He noted the progress made but stressed the need for urgent and sustained action to overcome economic, social, and cultural barriers. The/Nudge Prize team analyzed all of the PLFS data across the last two cycles of different sectors that are contributing to or witnessing higher growth rates to build this report. \"When we looked at PLFS data, we understood what the supply side is or where women or men work today. But there are no other data pointers available where we can clearly see what are the demand markers available in India which will hire women, or which may be better suited for women to take jobs or to drive their entrepreneurial journeys,\" the report said. \"One of the key things to consider, if we need to solve or address labour force participation rate, is to have a holistic approach. Not only to see how labour is available and what skills are available, but also to see what is driving demand today -- and this is exactly what we also bring out in the report,\" it added.',\n",

In May and June, the collections were at Rs 1.73 lakh crore and Rs 1.74 lakh crore, respectively. Experts also pointed out that the decline in the GST revenue is because of the increase in the refunds. \"Despite a decline in net GST revenue due to increased refunds, the continued growth in gross GST collections indicate a robust economy. The government\\'s commitment to reduce working capital costs for businesses facing inverted duty structure is demonstrated by the higher domestic GST refunds\" said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY He also highlighted that \"By rationalizing rates, the government aims to address this issue over time.

       "  'Industry-academia collaborations in India have transformed into a vibrant ecosystem, bridging the gap between theoretical learning and industry needs. This shift is driving innovation,  economic development , and improving  student employability . Initially, these collaborations focused on theoretical research with limited practical application. However, a shift towards applied research now sees academic institutions working closely with industries to solve real-world challenges. Interdisciplinary learning has also gained prominence, providing students with versatile skills highly valued in the job market. Innovation has become central to these partnerships, with research parks, innovation labs, and start-up incubators emerging as key hubs.  \"The evolving collaboration between industry and academia in India is not just a partnership; it\\'s a powerful engine for innovation and growth. By aligning  academic research  with real-world industry needs, we are creating a dynamic ecosystem that fosters creativity, entrepreneurship, and economic development. This synergy is transforming students into industry-ready professionals and positioning India as a global hub for innovation,\" said Prof. Rajesh Sahay, chairman of Hierank Business School Noida. Government initiatives like Make in India and Startup India have further strengthened these collaborations by providing funding and infrastructure.',\n",
       "  \"India's electric vehicle industry is rapidly accelerating, with sales expected to jump 66% in 2024 and reach nearly a third of the passenger vehicle market by 2030 as per research by  Counterpoint . The growth is primarily driven by rising fuel costs, government policies, and a growing number of   models from automakers. This is fostering a domestic EV ecosystem with increasing production capacity.  Today, the discussion around Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s EV adoption is focused on the need for developing the required indigenous infrastructure given the rising adoption of electric mobility for both four- and  two-wheelers . In a recent report by Bloomberg New Economy Forum, the electric two-wheeler market saw a substantial increase with sales growing by 13% to nearly 18 million units. To make electric mobility more affordable for Indians as well as meet the rising demand, the need of the hour is to develop the domestic EV manufacturing ecosystem, including the  chip design , which will power the EV industry in the coming years. This will not only help in deeper penetration of EVs but also make the country self-reliant in this critical sector. Indian chip design companies have an opportunity to carve a unique niche in the EV ecosystem by strategically addressing local needs and untapped opportunities. Traditionally, automotive electronics have always catered to four-wheelers. The progressive dependence of the driver on electronics for control, safety, comfort and entertainment in traditional internal combustion automobiles made investments in EV for four-wheelers a logical step for tier 1 suppliers and OEMs. This overlooks the massive two-wheeler market, which traditionally used basic electronics. The advent of EV has changed this, and the realization that two-wheelers, including the electric ones, are a dominant force in India and other developing economies opens up a new paradigm for  innovation  particularly in chips and electronics. This presents an opportunity for Indian chip design companies to bridge the gap by curating specialized, cost-efficient chips specifically designed to cater to the requirements of two-wheelers. This could involve chips addressing specific challenges faced in rural areas, such as last-mile navigation systems, enhanced battery management systems that function efficiently with the often-unpredictable power distribution in these regions, and components that can work under harsh climate conditions. These areas might not be top priorities for global players, but they hold immense significance for the  Indian market . That said, India's expanding two- and four-wheeler segments have also attracted the attention of global players lately. These companies are keen on partnering with Indian automotive OEM manufacturers to introduce innovative Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) chips. Such collaborations emphasize the importance of India's automotive market and the pivotal role domestic semiconductor companies can play in offering customized and cost-effective solutions. As vehicles become increasingly complex and connected, there is an escalating need for reliable, innovative, and locally produced  semiconductor solutions . Focus on innovation will be the key, and forward-looking policies like the Design Linked Initiative (DLI) and infrastructure funding aim to enable startups to come out with Proof of Concepts to cater to the local EV ecosystem. What we need now is a strong entrepreneurial drive to seize the opportunities presented by the Indian EV market. A strategic focus on emerging markets, addressing local needs, fostering collaboration within the electronics sector, and focusing on innovation can be a lucrative gambit for automotive-focused chip design startups.\",\n",
       "  'Cities like Indore, Coimbatore, Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam, long overshadowed by metropolises like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, are emerging as the new hotspots for the  technology industry .  Global capability centers  (GCCs) of  multinational corporations  are increasingly setting up shop in these cities, drawn by the promise of untapped talent pools, lower costs, and a better quality of life. â\\x80\\x9cThe winds of change are here,â\\x80\\x9d says Rahul Atri, managing director of Rakuten Symphony India. Based out of Indore, Rahul is at the forefront of this transformation. â\\x80\\x9cIf we as leaders wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it, who else will? Somebody has to take the first step, create the playbooks and cheat books.â\\x80\\x9d Rakuten Symphony, a telecom subsidiary of Japanâ\\x80\\x99s Rakuten Group, has already filed over 300 patents from its Indore centre. The company delivers world-class software on telecom automation to clients across the globe. â\\x80\\x9cThis is very special for people here,â\\x80\\x9d Rahul notes with pride. â\\x80\\x9cWe come from the heart of the country.â\\x80\\x9d The rise of these  emerging hubs  aligns with the Indian governmentâ\\x80\\x99s plan to develop the nation holistically. State governments are actively pitching these cities to GCCs, offering a range of incentives and support. But itâ\\x80\\x99s not just about the bottom line. These emerging hubs offer a quality of life that is increasingly rare in the crowded, congested met ros. â\\x80\\x9c33% of Indore has forest cover,â\\x80\\x9d Rahul points out. â\\x80\\x9cThe food is great, the cost of living is low, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s a real sense of community here.â\\x80\\x9d Indeed, the allure of these smaller cities is multifaceted. For companies, they offer a respite from the intense competition for talent in tech hubs like Bengaluru. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I was at Mastercard, we had Vadodara as a huge hub,â\\x80\\x9d recalls Sirisha Voruganti, CEO and MD of Lloyds Technology Centre. â\\x80\\x9cOur attrition was in the very low singledigit numbers. This allowed us to retain a talent pool we had trained, significantly increasing our productivity.â\\x80\\x9d Sirisha, a veteran in the tech industry with over 30 years of experience, sees these emerging hubs as a solution to the challenges faced by GCCs in major metros. â\\x80\\x9cThe time is now to look at tier two and tier three locations in India. In the big cities, weâ\\x80\\x99re dealing with high attrition rates and infrastructure issues. The tier two cities offer a refreshing alternative.â\\x80\\x9d Of course, there are challenges in setting up in these emerging hubs. Connectivity, both physical and digital, can be an issue. â\\x80\\x9cGovernments need to provide more than just tax benefits,â\\x80\\x9d cautions Voruganti. â\\x80\\x9cWe need good schools, hospitals, airports â\\x80\\x93 an entire ecosystem to attract and retain talent.â\\x80\\x9d This, she says, is particularly important to attract senior and mid-level talent. Senior talent is critical to ensure a GCC grows and innovates. Building this ecosystem requires a collaborative effort between GCCs, governments, and academia. â\\x80\\x9cWe work with local universities to shape the curriculum, build electives, and polish the raw skills,â\\x80\\x9d says Naved Narayan, VP of mobility solutions and head of the Coimbatore R&D centre of Bosch Global Software Technologies. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a long process, but the results are worth it.â\\x80\\x9d Bosch has been in Coimbatore for over 16 years now and has seen the city transform. â\\x80\\x9cWhen we first came here, we had to start from scratch,â\\x80\\x9d Narayan recalls. â\\x80\\x9cBut now, there are many companies here, and the talent pool has grown tremendously.â\\x80\\x9d This growth is not just quanti tative, but qualitative as well. â\\x80\\x9cPeople here have great problem-solving skills,â\\x80\\x9d Narayan notes. â\\x80\\x9cThey are resourceful, eager to learn, and have a real hunger to make a difference.â\\x80\\x9d This hunger is evident in the startups that are sprouting up in these cities, often with the support of the GCCs. â\\x80\\x9cWe work with startups, incubate them, provide them access to our technology and markets,â\\x80\\x9d Rahul says. â\\x80\\x9cYou never know which part of their product can hit your business and help you grow.â\\x80\\x9d As these emerging hubs grow, they are beginning to develop their own unique specialisations. Ahmedabad and Indore, for instance, are becoming known for their fintech and cybersecurity capabilities. Bhubaneswar is developing expertise in AI and machine learning. â\\x80\\x9cFind your niche, think 20 years ahead,â\\x80\\x9d Rahul advises. â\\x80\\x9cWhen youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking of setting up in these cities, think of the capabilities you want to build. Invest in sustainable data centres, in AI. Become a differentiator.â\\x80\\x9d Srikanth Srinivasan, vice president at Nasscom, agrees that building talent is a journey that will take time. â\\x80\\x9cThat would have been the case even for the larger cities at some point of time in the past decade or two. Itâ\\x80\\x99s something that you need to work on.â\\x80\\x9d To attract the right talent, Srinivasan recommends companies start the process as early as possible. â\\x80\\x9cYou need to start now. And probably you will start getting results only three or five years from now.â\\x80\\x9d The rise of these emerging hubs is not just a business imperative, but a social one as well. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s about the next generation, the next cities we want to invest in,â\\x80\\x9d Rahul says. â\\x80\\x9cIf we can create five more Bengalurus, ten more Hyderabads, we will truly be the India we all aspire to live in.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       "  'BENGALURU: Union minister for electronics and IT,  , expressed confidence that technological innovation will continue to thrive despite the implementation of AI regulations. He emphasised that these regulations, which include appropriate safeguards, will not hinder the growth and development of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies. Vaishnaw\\'s statement underscores the govt\\'s commitment to foster a conducive environment to encourage  AI innovation . It also highlights the importance of ensuring that AI guardrails are in place to allay potential risks and concerns associated with AI. \"Our approach in the AI mission is basically the approach of democratising technology. Our Prime Minister has always mandated that technology has to be accessible to all the startups, academia, students, and researchers. It cannot be monopolised by a handful. So that\\'s why the entire approach in our AI mission is to make sure that the public investment creates an infrastructure which is then used by multiple people,\" he said at the tenth edition of the The  Economic Times Startup Awards  (ETSA) 2024, held in Bengaluru on Saturday. \"We have two different models before us. One is the US model. The second is the European model. I honestly don\\'t think that the way some of the countries have put so much regulation on AI is the right way to go. The way we created a structure in our data privacy law and in the telecom law, we\\'ve allowed the space for innovation to flourish. We ensured that while providing this space, the potential harms that could affect society were fully controlled. We will be able to apply this approach in the case of AI as well,\" he added. He said the govt has consistently leveraged pre-existing structures within welfare programmes. He cited the example of  digital identities , which play a central role in both the healthcare and agriculture industries. \"The Prime Minister launched the agriculture mission. With digital lending, we want to create a system where big banks and lenders pursue loans less than $10. Now, loans worth $200 million have been disbursed where the average ticket size is Rs 2,000. Many startups are working on such solutions. It has taken us two years to get here,\" Vaishnaw said. Addressing the policy decision to have more FM stations and withdrawing the broadcast bill, Vaishnaw said the govt is looking to build the  creator economy  to harness India\\'s soft power. \"There is a huge creator\\'s economy. The way tech has emerged, it is possible for someone from a village to do videos on the culture of that place or cuisine and become a global sensation,\" he added. In a fireside chat with Infosys co-founder and chairman Nandan Nilekani, Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal said the current economic scenario presents an opportunity for entrepreneurs to demonstrate to investors their ability to effectively allocate profits. \"Earlier the question was whether startups can make profits. Everybody is starting to make profits now,\" Bansal said. His remarks come at a time when investors are increasingly asking startups to generate returns from the capital they raised during the period of low interest rates. Nilekani is also the jury chair for this year\\'s awards. Bansal also emphasised the importance of startups being prudent with their financial resources. \"If the company starts treating a Rs 1 lakh as Rs 1, then something is going to be wrong. I have seen that in my own company,\" he cautioned, highlighting the need for responsible financial management within startups. Nilekani also steered the discussion towards the concept of \\'grandfathering of startups,\\' referring to the trend of startup founders continuously establishing and nurturing new ventures.',\n",

       "  'The  Maha Infra Town Hall , a collaborative effort between the  Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority  (MMRDA) and The Times of India, took place on Tuesday, October 8, 2024, at Mumbai\\'s National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA). The event brought together influential policymakers, stakeholders, and industry experts to discuss the rapid  infrastructure development  in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region ( MMR ). The conclave provided insights into the latest projects and investment prospects in Maharashtra. The event featured three panel discussions, with the second panel delving into the \"Social Impact of Infra development\" projects in the MMR. The panelists examined how enhanced infrastructure has improved the quality of life for residents and fostered social equity in the region. The MMR is already making significant strides in infrastructure development, with projects such as the  Bandra-Worli Sea Link , multiple Metro lines, and other crucial initiatives paving the way for progress. Santosh Rai, the Operations Director and CBO of  HCC , a company that significantly contributed to the construction of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, provided essential information about the project. He emphasized that it was among the most technologically demanding endeavors undertaken in India. Rai highlighted the immense suspended weight of the bridge during its construction phase, which reached an impressive 2,500 tonnes. He also noted that the project\\'s marine nature posed unique challenges, as climatic conditions restricted construction activities to specific periods throughout the year. To ensure the structural integrity of the sea link, the HCC team strategically minimized the number of cables used in the construction process. This decision was crucial in reducing vibrations caused by the sea, thereby enhancing the overall stability and durability of the structure. Nalin Gupta, MD of  J Kumar Infraprojects  Ltd, a company instrumental in constructing Mumbai\\'s metro stations and a pioneer in introducing pre-cast technology for public transport, added, â\\x80\\x9cMumbai never sleeps,\" making it impractical to carry out heavy construction during the day, while night work presented unique obstacles.â\\x80\\x9d The traffic density in Mumbai is higher than in other metropolitan cities and Tier II and Tier III cities. Although not their primary responsibility, the company encountered challenges with space allocation, traffic diversion, and the relocation of affected residents. Constructing 25 stations within 30 months during the project\\'s first phase was a daunting task. To adhere to the schedule, they pioneered the use of precast technology for public transport in India. While tunnelling projects were less complicated than elevated ones, building underground metro stations was particularly challenging, as the entire ground level had to be cleared for the excavation process. Vijay Karia, the owner of  Ravin Group , emphasized the substantial difficulties in supplying power for these infrastructure initiatives. He noted: \"Bringing electricity to Mumbai is particularly challenging, as overhead wires require a vast amount of space.\" Despite the skepticism from numerous global firms, Karia\\'s company achieved the feat of providing an extra 1,800 megawatts of electricity using an innovative approach. The electricity was transmitted through direct cables hung at a height of 40 meters, leading to the towers.  From that point, the power was directed underground to facilitate the metro construction. This groundbreaking method was unprecedented in Asia, marking a significant milestone in the region\\'s infrastructure development. Inaugurating The Maha Infra Town Hall, Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee said, â\\x80\\x9cMMRDA is guided by three simple things; first one is rebooting of Mumbai, second is reshaping of MMR region, and third is a catch line, which is called Mumbai in minutes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe intend to reshape Mumbai in a way that will be most suitable for the requirements of the MMR region and the residents of that area. We say we\\'ll make it world class, but more than that, we\\'ll make it something which resonates with the people who live there,â\\x80\\x9d he said.',\n",

       "  \"Vijayawada: Chief minister   on Thursday directed the officials to explore opportunities to create jobs in the private sector.  In a review meeting with the officials of industries, MSME, SERP, and skill development departments, Naidu told the officials to create hybrid work models to create  employment opportunities  in rural areas. Naidu asked the officials to come up with innovative and out-of-the-box ideas for employment generation. He said that creating two million employment opportunities in the coming five years is the priority for the state govt. Naidu stated that through skill training and upgradation, the govt should focus on filling the gap between industry needs and available human resources. Recollecting his recent interactions with flood victims in Vijayawada, Naidu said that several victims requested jobs as they lost everything. He told the officials to prepare an action plan to provide employment opportunities to people in flood-affected areas. In another review meeting with the officials of youth affairs and sports, Naidu criticised the previous YSRC govt for neglecting sports completely for five years. He said that during the previous TDP regime, the construction of stadiums and the development of playgrounds were taken up on a massive scale. Naidu directed the officials to complete all pending works of playgrounds, stadiums, and other infrastructure works expeditiously. Naidu said that 23 crore is being sanctioned for the purpose. He said that sports are not only for those who participate in competitions but should be made part of everyone's lifestyle. Playing a sport on a daily basis will make them fit and keep them in good health.  Recalling that earlier people used to play kabaddi and volleyball in almost all the villages, he expressed concern that this practice has disappeared after TVs and smartphones came into existence. Naidu told the officials to involve locals in developing playgrounds in rural areas. If Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and industrialists come forward to fund these playgrounds, they can be named after them, he added. Naidu set a target of hosting 2027 National Games in  . He said that the required  sports infrastructure  should be made ready by then. Though the sports policy was formed in 2017, it came to an end in 2022, and the YSRCP govt did not take the initiative to formulate a new policy, he said and stressed the need to formulate a new sports policy. He said that sports infrastructure should be developed in all major cities like Tirupati, Amaravathi, and Visakhapatnam. Naidu further told officials to take steps to set up sports centres in all the district collectorates and other govt offices. \",\n",

Yadav made the remark while virtually addressing a conference organised in Bhopal by the Construction Industry Development Council (CIDC). Yadav also inaugurated the conference on â\\x80\\x98Incorporation of Innovations in Infrastructure Construction\\'. Commenting on the use of technology in the infrastructure sector, he said, \"We should recognise the power of technology, make good use of it, and fulfil the resolve in the interest of society so that along with this generation, the coming generations too can benefit.\" CM said that the conference should consider  infrastructure development , environment, health, innovation and other aspects holistically. In the era of new technology, only continuous discussions on one platform will open new ways and doors for inclusive development. Every possibility should be explored for the betterment of the state and construction, he said. Yadav emphasised building effective and flexible infrastructure to protect against natural disasters and climate change crises. The pace of construction will also have to be increased by adopting new methods, as there are immense possibilities in the field of construction. There is also scope for improvement in reducing construction costs and resources. \"Today, there is a need to adopt  environment-friendly construction  materials and construction processes. Weather-based construction also needs to be considered holistically,\" he said. Noting that the event has been organised on teachers\\' day, he said, \"Today we will get new inspiration on teachers\\' day, dedicated to Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. You all know that the Guru-Shishya tradition has special importance in Indian culture. Keeping this in view, the Madhya Pradesh govt has decided to celebrate the festival of Guru Purnima at the govt level. It is a matter of happiness that the name of vice chancellors has now been changed to Kulgurus.\" CM Yadav said that researchers are like scientific gurus. The spirit of public interest in the field of research has been in our tradition since ancient times. On the occasion, MLA Satish Malviya, Ujjain divisional commissioner Sanjay Gupta, and inspector general of police Santosh Kumar Singh were also present at CM\\'s residence in Ujjain. ',\n",

Speaking at the 37th meeting of the 57th regular session of the United Nation's Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Switzerland on Thursday, Sowmiya said  gender inequality  and environmental degradation aggravate the disproportionate impact on women, especially in agriculture, water security, health, nutrition and climate-induced migration. â\\x80\\x9cWomen make up a significant portion of the agricultural workforce, particularly in developing regions. Climate change increases the frequency of droughts, floods, cyclones and extreme weather events, severely threatening the livelihoods of these women, exposing them to safety risks, health risks and physical exhaustion, thereby reducing their time for education, employment and empowerment,â\\x80\\x9d she said. She said every year hundreds of thousands of adolescent girls discontinue their school education due to lack of water in their school toilets triggered by climate change.  â\\x80\\x9cAddressing the disproportionate impact of climate change on women requires empowering women through education, land rights, access to resources and involving women in decision-making process at local, national and international levels,â\\x80\\x9d she suggested. She held Western countries responsible for the historical emissions since the Industrial Revolution contributing heavily to climate change. â\\x80\\x9cDeveloping countries and island nations, despite contributing the least, face the most severe impacts.

       "  'GENEVA: Workers have seen their slice of the  global income  pie shrink significantly over the past two decades, swelling  inequality  and depriving the combined labour force of trillions, the UN said Wednesday. The United Nations\\' International Labour Organization said that the global  labour income share  -- or the proportion of total income in an economy earned by working -- had fallen by 1.6% points since 2004. \"While the decrease appears modest in terms of percentage points, in 2024 it represents an annual shortfall in labour income of $2.4 trillion compared to what workers would have earned had the labour income share remained stable since 2004,\" the  ILO  said in a report. The study highlighted the Covid-19 pandemic as a key driver of the decline, with almost half of the reduction in labour income share taking place during the pandemic years of 2020-2022. The global crisis exacerbated existing inequalities, particularly as capital income has continued to concentrate ever more among the wealthiest, it said. \"Countries must take action to counter the risk of declining labour income share,\" Celeste Drake, the ILO deputy director-general, said in a statement. \"We need policies that promote an equitable distribution of economic benefits, including freedom of association, collective bargaining and effective labour administration, to achieve inclusive growth, and build a path to sustainable development for all.\" The ILO stressed that technological advances, including automation, were a key driver of the declines in labour income share. \"While these innovations have boosted productivity and output, the evidence suggests that workers are not sharing equitably from the resulting gains,\" the UN labour agency said. It voiced particular concern that the artificial intelligence boom risked deepening inequality further. \"If historical patterns were to persist... the recent breakthroughs in generative AI could exert further downward pressure on the labour income share,\" the report said, stressing \"the importance of ensuring that any benefits of AI are widely distributed\". The ILO found that workers currently rake in just 52.3% of global income, while capital income -- earned by owners of assets like land, machines, buildings and patents -- accounts for the rest. Since capital income tends to be concentrated among wealthier individuals, the labour income share is widely used as a measure of inequality. It also helps measure progress towards the UN sustainable development goal aimed at significantly reducing inequality between and within countries between 2015 and 2030. \"The report indicates slow progress as the 2030 deadline approaches,\" ILO said. The report also emphasised the stubbornly high incidence of young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). Since 2015, the global percentage has slipped slightly, from 21.3% to 20.4% this year. But there are major regional differences, with a third of youth in Arab states and nearly a quarter in Africa falling into the NEET category.  The report also highlighted a large gender gap, with the global NEET incidence among young women standing at 28.2% -- more than double the 13.1% seen among young men.',\n",

The average wealth per person in the top 1 percent increased by approximately $400,000 in real terms during this period, while a person in the bottom half saw an average increase of just $335, equivalent to less than nine cents per day. As  G20  finance ministers prepare to meet in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, they are expected to establish the groundwork for a landmark global agreement to raise taxes on the  super-rich . This proposal, supported by countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Spain, and France, comes amidst growing public demand for measures to curb extreme levels of inequality and ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. \"Inequality has reached obscene levels, and until now governments have failed to protect people and planet from its catastrophic effects,\" said Oxfam International\\'s Head of Inequality Policy, Max Lawson in a press release. \"The richest one percent of humanity continues to fill their pockets while the rest are left to scrap for crumbs.\" Oxfam\\'s research reveals that a \"war on fair  taxation \" has led to a significant reduction in  tax rates  on the wealth and income of the richest individuals. In G20 countries, less than eight cents of every dollar raised in tax revenue now comes from taxes on wealth.  Additionally, the share of income earned by the top 1 percent in G20 countries has increased by 45 percent over four decades, while top tax rates on their incomes have been reduced by approximately a third. On a global scale, billionaires have been paying a tax rate equivalent to less than 0.5 percent of their wealth, despite their fortunes growing by an annual average of 7.1 percent over the past four decades. Oxfam estimates that an annual net wealth tax of at least 8 percent would be necessary to reduce the extreme wealth of billionaires, with G20 countries being home to nearly 80 percent of the world\\'s billionaires.',\n",

       "  'Amid polls to constitute the 18th Lok Sabha, the governing party and the opposition have clashed over a critical question â\\x80\\x94 how much inequality is India willing to tolerate? In its manifesto, Congress has promised to conduct a nationwide caste census to determine the socio-economic conditions of various caste and sub-caste groups. Congress functionaries have taken umbrage to the unfair concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few individuals. BJP has hit back, accusing Congress of appeasement politics and termed this exercise an attempt to extract private wealth from individuals and redistribute it among minorities. The issue is philosophical: to whom do a countryâ\\x80\\x99s material resources belong? As this debate rages on in election rallies and across TV newsrooms, the   is quietly preparing to answer this question. While deciding a seemingly innocuous set of property disputes originally filed in 1992, the SC has felt the need to re-interpret Article 39(b) of the Constitution, a directive principle of state policy which urges the state to make policies to ensure â\\x80\\x9cthat the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as to best subserve the common goodâ\\x80\\x9d. Generally, directive principles of state policy are unenforceable by a court of law. A member of the Constituent Assembly even described the entire part as a â\\x80\\x98dustbin of sentimentâ\\x80\\x99. But Article 39(b) is different. It is underwritten by Article 31C â\\x80\\x94 which provides that a law made by Parliament in furtherance of Article 39(b) is not invalid even if it violates fundamental rights such as  equality  and freedom of trade. It is worth mentioning that the linkage between the two provisions is also an issue before the Supreme Court in this very case. Of course, the expression â\\x80\\x98material resourcesâ\\x80\\x99 must include public resources. The question is simple: does it include private resources as well? A recent study by the World Inequality Database has stated that  wealth inequality  in India is now higher than what it was during British rule in India. In light of this, Parliament could potentially enact a â\\x80\\x98wealth taxâ\\x80\\x99 where all citizens with a certain net worth would be taxed 2% of their wealth. Challenging the law because it violates fundamental rights such as equality, life and personal liberty, and freedom of trade would be futile, because Article 39(b), backed up by Article 31C, would kick in. Another example includes a law to acquire all privately held forest land across the country and distribute it among tribal communities who are displaced by climate change, infrastructure projects, internal conflict etc. A mere reference in such an Act to Article 39(b) will save it from being struck down. The implications of this case go beyond the immediate political debate. Its significance lies in how the apex court interprets the constitutional guarantee of equality, and how much power it gives to the state to fulfil this guarantee. A restrictive interpre tation will assign the role of reducing inequality to the private market, hoping that â\\x80\\x98invisible handâ\\x80\\x99 will reach everyone. A broader interpretation will give greater powers to the state to interfere in private affairs to ensure proper redistribution of wealth. Underlying this provision is an assumption that the state may be better capable of ensuring equality. This may be true in some cases, but very false in others. During the hearings, CJI Chandrachud stated that Article 39(b) could not be interpreted in a purely communist or socialist sense. He seemed to detect a Gandhian flavour to the provision. It is hence likely that the SC will give us a more nuanced interpretation of Article 39(b).  Private property  may not be wholly excluded, but certain kinds of private property may be declared to be held in trust. The authors are with the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy',\n",

       "  'NEW DELHI: Concerned over cascading crises and challenges facing the global economy, the  G20 leaders  on Saturday underlined the need for well-calibrated  monetary , fiscal, financial and  structural  policies to promote growth, reduce inequalities and maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. The  G20  leaders want the central banks to remain strongly committed to achieving price stability in line with their respective mandates. \"They (central banks) will ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and will clearly communicate policy stances to help limit negative cross-country spillovers. Central bank independence is crucial to maintaining policy credibility,\" said the New Delhi Declaration adopted by the G20 leaders. The New Delhi Declaration adopted at the Summit of leaders of the world\\'s top 20 economies held under India\\'s presidency noted that cascading crises have posed challenges to long-term growth. Facing an uneven recovery and cognizant of the need to boost long-term growth, we will implement well-calibrated macroeconomic and structural policies. \"We will protect the vulnerable, through promoting equitable growth and enhancing macroeconomic and financial stability. Such an approach will help resolve the cost-of-living crisis and unlock strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth,\" the Declaration said. Global economic growth is below its long-run average and remains uneven. The uncertainty around the outlook remains high. With notable tightening in global financial conditions, which could worsen debt vulnerabilities, persistent inflation and geoeconomic tensions, the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside, it added. \"We, therefore, reiterate the need for well-calibrated monetary, fiscal, financial, and structural policies to promote growth, reduce inequalities and maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. We will continue to enhance macro policy cooperation and support the progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \"We reaffirm that achieving strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth (SSBIG) will require policymakers to stay agile and flexible in their policy response, as evidenced during the recent banking turbulence in a few advanced economies where expeditious action by relevant authorities helped to maintain financial stability and manage spillovers,\" the leaders said. The G20 also welcomed the initial steps taken by the  Financial Stability Board  (FSB), standard-setting bodies (SSBs) and certain jurisdictions to examine what lessons can be learned from this recent banking turbulence and encourage them to advance their ongoing work. The leaders emphasised that they will use macroprudential policies, where required, to safeguard against downside risks. The Declaration said: \"Central banks remain strongly committed to achieving price stability in line with their respective mandates. They will ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and will clearly communicate policy stances to help limit negative cross-country spillovers\". The declaration also stressed that central bank independence is crucial to maintaining policy credibility. \"We will prioritise temporary and targeted fiscal measures to protect the poor and the most vulnerable while maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. Ensuring the overall coherence of the monetary and fiscal stances remains important,\" it noted. The G20 Declaration recognised the importance of supply-side policies, especially policies that increase labour supply and enhance productivity to boost growth and alleviate price pressures. \"We reaffirm the April 2021 exchange rate commitment made by our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,\" it said. The leaders also recognised the critical role of private enterprises in accelerating growth and driving sustainable economic transformations. To this end, they resolved to work with the private sector to create inclusive, sustainable, and resilient global value chains, and support developing countries to move up the value chain and facilitate investments, including foreign direct investments (FDIs) towards sustainable business models. They also resolved to work with the private sector to devise pipelines of investible projects in developing countries by leveraging the expertise of MDBs (multilateral development banks) to mobilise investments and promote ease and reduce the cost of doing business. The declaration also recognised that startups and MSMEs are natural engines of growth.',\n",
       "  \"IMF Chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas is optimistic about Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s growth prospects. In an interview to TOI, Gourinchas talks about a range of issues from raising  productivity  in India to bridging inequality through a billionaire tax and impact of  AI  on jobs. Excerpts India has been doing quite well. In FY 2023-24, growth was stronger than expected. The World Economic Outlook projection for this year is around 6.8%. India can continue to grow around 6.5% in the medium term. These are very, very solid growth numbers. It's much easier for a smaller country to generate high growth, but for an economy of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s size, it is pretty impressive. A number of things need to be done to grow at a much faster rate. There is a question of how quickly you can mobilise  labour inputs . If you want to grow faster, and you want it to be sustainable, you have to increase productivity. You cannot do it just by having more workers and more capital -- that gives you a shot in the arm, but it doesn't lead to sustained growth. To increase productivity, you have to reduce any frictions around the  ease of doing business , investing and innovating.  India has a relatively high growth rate, but it's starting at a fairly low per capita income compared to some other Asian economies. Another way to achieve higher productivity is improvements on the technology frontier. The hard way is to reinvent the wheel, which takes time. The other way is to learn as much as you can from foreign technology. External openness is very important as foreign direct investment ( FDI ) brings plant and technology. Third part of productivity improvement is skilling the labour force. India has a very skilled layer of workers, but it can do better. There are also reforms of the large domestic markets as it can be a good training ground for making sure that there is innovation and competition; that firms are not protected in a way that allows them to be inefficient; that there is enough competition domestically. Labour is another advantage for India because of the demographic dividend. A first order task is making sure the educational system, vocational training are at scale so that you can bring a lot of workers who are not in the labour force and you can reduce informality. Digitalization will also be helpful. Why do you have to choose? I understand you have a budget for doing various things, do you do production-linked incentives or something else. There is room for merchandise exports to grow as India is fairly low on that front. It is important to make sure that you have firms that are competing and are able to come down the cost curve. Here, the role of the domestic market is very important. China implemented an export oriented strategy but was in part driven by a very high level of competition in the domestic market, which to some extent was protected from abroad. Fierce competition between Chinese firms forced them to improve and become better and then engage in global markets. Integrating the Indian economy into a single market will be a huge benefit. On top of that, you can push exports of services by training a large number of skilled Indian workers in STEM, computer science. There's a bit of a false dichotomy. At the end of the day, productivity always creates jobs. Initially, you may for instance, think about improving productivity in the farming sector. It's very likely that productivity gains are going to release labour into other sectors of the economy. That's something that should be welcomed. The question is more about ensuring social safety nets and dealing with retraining, giving pathways to the young to get them jobs that have higher earning potential. An IMF paper talked about 33% of the workers in developed countries getting potentially displaced by AI and the number for developing countries was 24%. How serious is this threat of artificial intelligence? India is one of the countries we looked at using micro data. One dimension is exposure of jobs to AI, which is low. It reflects the high share of farming in employment. The second dimension is when you look at those that are exposed, the question is if AI is going to replace them or AI is going to enhance what they're doing? AI is not an opportunity for enough people in India, but for those who are exposed to AI, more of them are in the good category. To build on that you would want deployment of AI, development of AI and training as a lot of workers in that space can really benefit. This is pointing to opportunities. The danger is if AI moves faster than India getting ready to embrace it. At the IMF we endorse progressivity in the tax system, but excessive forms of taxation can be detrimental to capital accumulation or savings, which will impact growth. No society has full tolerance for any degree of inequality. We can have a certain amount of redistribution, which can be ex-ante or ex-post. From an economic principle, ex-ante is better, offering similar chances to people. There is a lot of evidence pointing that the tax systems globally have not been as fair and as equitable as they could be. In a globally integrated economy, there may be opportunities for some of the wealthier individuals or corporations to do tax optimization, allowing them a lower tax burden. There's been a big effort on the corporate side to harmonise capital income taxation and ensuring that corporations are unable to shop around by setting up shop in low tax jurisdictions. There is a parallel effort that is now starting at the G20 to think about something similar for the ultra-wealthy individuals, some sort of billionaire tax that can be harmonised. It is very preliminary. When you're looking at individuals, the implementation can be incredibly tricky. This is something that one must be careful about. There may be a situation where you have an enormous concentration of profits in the hands of a few and you have enormous competition on labour supply, and most of the workers are maintained close. UBI can contribute to this type of situation, which is a very extreme situation. We must look at the questions in detail. What is the effect of UBI on incentives to participate in the labour market? There may be a situation where a few will be working while others will be on some form of transfer payment. One has to be very careful when thinking about these things â\\x80\\x93 there are questions of implementability and acceptability in terms of the social contract.\",\n",
       "  'The World Economic Forum (WEF) emphasises that   is still within our control, despite a concerning rise of over 60% in pollutant emissions, primarily composed of CO2 from energy and industry since 1992. Recently, the WEF released a report indicating that government pledges alone will not suffice to achieve the  zero emissions  target. The Paris Agreement established a critical threshold,  limiting  global temperature change to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. This choice reflects a balance between mitigating  climate change  impacts and practicality. While lower temperature targets promise greater climate resilience, the 1.5-degree goal is considered ambitious yet attainable, reducing the risk of severe environmental and social consequences. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has identified over 400 milestones crucial for preventing global temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius. These targets emphasise the imperative role of  renewable sources  such as solar and wind in becoming the primary global energy sources for achieving zero emissions. Climate Stability: Keeping the  temperature rise  to 1.5 degrees Celsius helps maintain a more stable climate. Beyond this threshold, the risk of severe and irreversible impacts increases, such as more frequent and intense heat waves, storms, and other extreme weather events. Ecosystem Preservation : Many ecosystems are highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius reduces the risk of widespread ecosystem disruptions, helping to preserve biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and maintain vital ecological services. Sea Level Rise Mitigation: Warmer temperatures contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to rising sea levels. Limiting global temperature rise can help mitigate the extent of sea level rise, protecting coastal communities and low-lying areas from increased flooding and erosion. Food Security: Higher temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can negatively impact agriculture. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius helps in safeguarding  food security  by minimizing the risk of crop failures, disruptions in food production, and water scarcity. Human Health: Climate change is associated with various health risks, including heat-related illnesses, the spread of infectious diseases, and disruptions to food and water supplies. Keeping temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius can help mitigate these health risks and protect vulnerable populations. Social and Economic Stability: Unmitigated climate change can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. Limiting global temperature rise can contribute to the stability of societies by reducing the likelihood of climate-induced conflicts, displacement of communities, and economic disruptions.',\n",
       "  'On  World Tourism Day , 40 Delhiites unleashed their inner explorers and hiked up to the Lal Kot, on the ruins of the ramparts of Qila Rai Pithora, in  Sanjay Van , to catch the glory of the golden hour.  Hiking on the rocky trails and wading through the bushes, the group first viewed the setting sun, followed by walking to another elevation to see the lit-up  Qutub Minar . Some made reels, some clicked selfies with Qutub in the backdrop and others sat silently on the rocks to enjoy the view. Everyone figured out a way to unwind post-office hours. The walk was organised by a cycling tour company, as a part of their  Public Mobility Project , aiming the community to come together and advocate for walkable and cycle-friendly cities.  Himanshu, the guide, explained, \"Sustainable and responsible tourism is not just about keeping mountains and beaches clean, but also about understanding your own city and recognising how fragile the ecosystems in the city are.

       "  'Some of the most beautiful, aesthetic, and marvellous buildings, skyscrapers, monuments, tombs, temples, churches, and so many more establishments owe their creation to Architects! They are the genius minds and hands who bring together the most exquisite designs and shape the rural and urban skylines. And to honour their art and skill, every year on October 7, World Architecture Day is observed, and every year a new theme is set for architects around the globe. In 2024, the theme set by the International Union of Architects (UIA) is \\'Empowering the next generation to participate in urban design\\'.  Each year, the UIA selects a theme that focuses on issues that the world is currently facing and then implements the theme to move forward in a more holistic and sustainable way. The objective of the day and its theme is to raise awareness about the role of architecture in shaping lives, encouraging innovative and socially responsible design, and supporting environmentally conscious urban planning. And so, on the occassion of World Architecture Day, we spoke to some leading architects to know their thoughts and ideas about  green living  in  urban spaces  and how architecture can help turn urban spaces from concrete jungles, to a more sustainable areas.  Across the globe, the rate of  urbanisation  is accelerating today. As our cities and towns become larger and denser, open,  green spaces  in urban areas are increasingly shrinking --from courtyards and balconies in single-family homes and offices to landscaped plazas and parks in neighbourhoods. A hypothesis put forward by noted American biologist Edward O. Wilson in 1984, states that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life, a phenomenon known as  biophilia . Our physical health and mental well-being are impacted by the presence of natural elements, or the lack thereof, in our living and working environmentsâ\\x80\\x94whether at home, in office, or schools. According to Rahul Kadri, Partner & Principal Architect at IMK Architects, \"The lack of such connections has been linked, in recent years, to adverse effects on our physiological and psychological well-being. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), for instance, is a health condition that is scientifically proven to afflict people living or working in poorly designed buildings --buildings with inadequate natural light and ventilation. It is essential for architects and planners, therefore, to design buildings and neighbourhoods in a way that closely integrates them with nature. Incorporating biophilic elements into the design of our urban spacesâ\\x80\\x94 through green spaces, landscapes, and sustainable architectureâ\\x80\\x94 does more than just beautify them. It offers a refuge from the concrete jungles that our cities are increasingly becoming and helps address our ecological responsibility. By putting green and blue spaces front and centre of our infrastructure investment, we also make our cities more resilient to crises, as they become more prevalent with climate change. We will finally be able to address that our cities are not just physically, but economically, socially and environmentally connected to their surrounding regions. By taking small, feasible steps in the short term, we can rebuild our social and economic fabric, and rebuild them for the better.\" \"A thoughtful approach to urban development is essential in creating healthier, greener living spaces. Sustainable architecture and design shape cities in important ways, like looking closely at settlement trends and taking action to fix environmental problems before building anything new. Prioritising green areas, especially protecting trees with deep roots, is a key part of this approach. Stabilising the land, stopping soil loss, and refilling groundwater are all long-term benefits for the ecosystem\\'s health. For instance, in one of our projects, we faced the challenge of adhering to a century-long drainage plan to avoid overburdening the existing network. To address this, deep water storage tanks were integrated into the design for each townhouse parcel, demonstrating how forward-thinking planning can prevent future strain on infrastructure. Another need in todayâ\\x80\\x99s sustainable urban development is immediate attention to disaster mitigation strategies. Sustainable architecture and design shape cities in important ways, like looking closely at settlement trends and taking action to fix environmental problems before building anything new. Prioritising green areas, especially protecting trees with deep roots, is a key part of this approach. Stabilising the land, stopping soil loss, and refilling groundwater are all long-term benefits for the ecosystem\\'s health. Disaster prevention methods are just as important for current sustainable urban growth. It\\'s helpful to see how vernacular buildings have changed to fit different temperatures and landscapes. When we combine old techniques with new technology, we can make infrastructure that lasts and is good for the environment while also building urban places that honour the area\\'s history. Modern imagination and traditional knowledge working together form the basis of green living. This allows for the creation of towns that are good for both people and the environment for many years to come.\" says Harsh Varshneya, Principal Architect, STHAPATI \"In the face of rapid urbanisation, sustainable architecture has emerged as a cornerstone for healthier, greener cities. Design now transcends mere aesthetics and material choices, prioritising the creation of spaces that enhance livability and promote long-term environmental balance. Todayâ\\x80\\x99s architects are revisiting traditional principles while embracing innovation, focusing on how their designs can respect and integrate with the surrounding context and communities. An important aspect is the contextual future-proofing of a project. When we build for tomorrow we must learn from the past and include those lessons in the present to build a better tomorrow. We often find what we are looking for is in the blueprints of the past. Many designers have also turned towards the use of local materials and passive cooling techniques with modern-day findings to create optimal design sensibilities. This hybrid approach creates mindful spaces that respect the site and its surroundings whilst catering to the ongoing challenges we face in and around the buildings we design. This respect for the surrounding ecosystem prioritises energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste reduction, all of which contribute to a more sustainable urban lifestyle. Equally crucial is the emphasis on using local materials and sensibilities. Sustainable architecture recognises that a buildingâ\\x80\\x99s context is profoundly linked to the knowledge and traditions of the people inhabiting its surroundings. By engaging with the locals, we can design spaces that bring out the individuality of the land itâ\\x80\\x99s built on whilst considering the siteâ\\x80\\x99s environmental distinctions. This collaboration not only enhances architectural integrity but also promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility among its users, ensuring such sustainable and inclusive efforts benefit everybody and not just the users of our designs. Ultimately, this approach cultivates urban environments that are functional and long-lasting. By upholding the site and its communities, we create spaces that resonate with its users, fostering a sense of belonging and responsibility. With this cities can grow sustainably, ensuring that the future generations receive vibrant, livable communities that honour both their heritage and ecological balance.\" says Jugal Mistri, Founder and Principal Architect, Jugal Mistri Architects \"Cities have paradoxically become both centers of social and ecological crises, while also serving as testing grounds for strategies to address these challenges. The future of building design and construction is undeniably greenâ\\x80\\x94our ability to meet global climate goals depends on it. Green buildings are more efficient than traditional buildings, having the potential to drive up revenues and lower operational costs. Revisions to building codes and rating systems have raised tremendous awareness of the green agenda and have been instrumental in bringing up the minimum environmental standards of building design. Over the past two decades, performance of building envelopesâ\\x80\\x94the amount of heat, light, noise, entering or leaving, its repercussion on energy consumption, the kind of insulation neededâ\\x80\\x94have all become standard design elements that most of us are aware of. Even at the planning level, some advancement has been made in formulating masterplans integrated into a regional frameworkâ\\x80\\x94a trend that needs to be further encouraged and more broadly adopted. These masterplans take into account not just local needs but also regional, environmental, social, and economic factors, aiming for a more holistic approach to urban development. In contrast, land development by private developers often remains a speculative exercise based on short-term gains and rapid project turnovers. These ventures prioritize immediate profit over long-term planning, which could be detrimental in the long run. At the urban level, more integrated developments that combine mixed-use functionsâ\\x80\\x94residential, commercial, and recreational spaces within the same areaâ\\x80\\x94have proven to be environmentally more successful by reducing the need for transportation, efficiently distributing infrastructure, and fostering more socially and culturally appropriate environments. And lastly, integration of green spaces within the urbanscape has marked a significant shift in urban planning and development. An important aspect is the transition towards a non-anthropocentric understanding of natural reserves that recognizes the ecological importance of such zones and forces a new understanding of human-nature connections.\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, Partner, team3 Delhi, the city of dreams for people from all over India, is constantly in news for rapid urbanisation, rampant use of unsustainable technologies, and an increasing blind eye towards ecological problems. But, some architects say that there still is some hope for the city and incorporating natural elements into the space isn\\'t impossible!  As per Mitu Mathur, Director, GPM Architects and Planners said, \" In major Indian cities like Delhi, the accelerating urbanisation rates have accentuated the need to incorporate eco-friendly and green living principles into our landscapes. Sustainable architectural design and planning are pivotal in transforming urban environments into healthier spaces. This shift towards sustainability addresses the challenges of rapid urbanisation, environmental degradation, and climate change while enhancing the quality of life for urban populations. A fundamental principle of sustainable design involves integrating natural elements into building projects. Green pockets are no longer viewed as obstacles to development but as essential features that enrich the urban fabric. By preserving existing green spaces and incorporating them into architectural plans, we can enhance the city\\'s overall livability. Green spaces that were once under threat of being overrun by the pressures of development are now recognised for their value in improving air quality, reducing urban heat islands, and forming natural oases within bustling urban centres.  Sustainable architecture drives cities toward energy efficiency with features like passive solar design, natural ventilation, and efficient insulation. Green roofs provide insulation and reduce the need for artificial heating and cooling while absorbing rainwater to prevent flooding. Additionally, urban farming practices allow residents to grow their food, creating a local, sustainable source of produce that reduces the need for transportation. These strategies reduce carbon footprints and lower utility and operational costs for inhabitants, making green living more accessible, financially viable, and self-sustaining.  However, green living also extends beyond building design to include sustainable transportation infrastructure encouraging walking, cycling, and public transport, significantly reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion while improving air quality. By prioritising green spaces, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation, sustainable architecture is transforming the way cities are designed and inhabited. Green living isn\\'t merely a trend but the future of urban development, offering a path to resilient, eco-friendly cities.\" \"Amidst the growing urbanisation and concrete jungles, human lives are faced with challenges related to lack of fresh air, congestion and absence of green spaces. Sustainable architecture is emerging as an answer, reshaping urban environments into healthier and greener living spaces. Designing with eco-friendly principles and incorporating methods that can improve user well-being through green practices form the base of this innovative approach. Vertical gardens, often making urban forests, are a popular method for enhancing air quality, cleansing the visual palette and improving overall aesthetics. These ingenious green walls transform the constrained spaces of an apartment building into a sustainable environment, where the walls invite butterflies and moths, increasing biodiversity. Provisions for sky gardens where the user can create a mini ecosystem on their own are also gaining importance. Drip irrigation can be used to improve the quality of life of plants and ensure their life throughout the year. Climbing plants can lower heat on walls and sunny windows while planting deciduous trees around dwellings offers shade and natural cooling. Green roofs act as insulation, maintain thermal comfort inside urban homes, and lower the need for artificial cooling systems, decreasing the carbon footprint by saving electricity.  While incorporating water as an element to create a microclimate, one thing that the designers have to be mindful of is the deterioration of groundwater. Reusing and recycling water while investing in water conservation techniques like rainwater harvesting helps in replenishing our dying resources. Smart irrigation systems ensure optimum water usage and reuse grey water from sinks for gardens after filtration, which helps maintain the greenery, but without the fear of collapse of the water table.  Green architecture not only involves the use of greenery and natural elements but also includes the use of sustainable materials like recycled wood, bamboo or mud. Choosing to style interiors using organic fabrics or buildings using sustainable techniques like rammed earth can go a long way in helping residents mitigate the catastrophes of living in an urban environment, says Vineeta Singhania Sharma, Founder Partner & Principal Architect, Confluence \"Can cities become living ecosystems that nourish both people and the planet? With urban centres expanding rapidly, the environmental toll is evident. Indian cities are grappling with a rapid decline in air quality and public health, driven by relentless urbanisation and unchecked development. Unmitigated natural disasters like flooding and torrential rains have made these problems worse, with disastrous results for communities all over the nation. The answer is a paradigm shift toward sustainable architecture, which emphasises environmental care while improving livability. Modern cities are embracing this shift through innovative design strategies aimed at minimising  environmental impact . Incorporating passive building techniques like optimising natural light and ventilation, reduce energy consumption significantly. Consciously designing with eco-friendly materials such as recycled concrete and low-carbon alternatives make an impact in reducing carbon footprint. The way that urban planners are integrating nature into cityscapes is drastically changing public areas. The proliferation of green roofs, vertical gardens, and urban farms mitigates the urban heat island effect, improves air quality, and enhances community well-being. Innovative stormwater management systems, such as bioswales and rain gardens, address the risks of flooding while filtering pollutants, demonstrating how sustainable design directly responds to the challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events.  Moreover, cities are becoming role models for resource efficiency. Rainwater harvesting technologies fight water scarcity in highly populated areas, and solar panels and wind turbines are used to collect renewable energy. As cities continue to grow, the move towards greener, smarter urban spaces is no longer optional but essential, as a necessary response to the climate crisis. Reimagining cities as ecosystems, enhances the quality of urban life and builds resilience for future generations.\" says Bedanta Saikia â\\x80\\x93 Vertical Head, Corporate Architecture, Science & Technology, Edifice Consultants ',\n",
       "  'NEW DELHI:  Collective action  and  community involvement  are essential to understanding and managing  Commons , emphasized seven grassroots-level changemakers at the opening plenary of the â\\x80\\x98Commons Conveningâ\\x80\\x99 held at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre in New Delhi on August 27. This three-day event brought together key stakeholdersâ\\x80\\x94including government officials, civil society leaders, researchers, and community representativesâ\\x80\\x94from over 20 states and Union Territories to address the critical challenges facing the governance of India\\'s ecological Commons. Jishudan Dishari from Odisha, whose village Barakutni was awarded the Prakruti Mitra award in 2022, shared his personal journey towards protecting Commons. \"As a child, I learned from my grandmother that nature would save people. But growing up, I witnessed soil erosion and the degradation of our village forests, making me realize that now, people have to save nature,\" Dishari said. This realization led him to explore  conservation  techniques such as tree planting and improving irrigation systems to regenerate natural resources. Dishari now works with over 50 youths and 100 women from nearby villages and calls for broader societal participation in conserving Commons. He urged the convening to advocate for laws that empower communities and ensure that policies do not hinder conservation efforts. The opening plenary, which honored \\'Changemakers for Commons,\\' highlighted community stewardship and set the tone for deep discussions, collaborative learning, and strategic planning. The discussions emphasized the importance of Commons in achieving the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development  and meeting climate action goals. Y. Nuklu Phom, from Yongyimchen village in Nagaland, shared his community\\'s transition from hunting to wildlife conservation, which has resulted in the larger conservation of Amur falcons. \"Switching from shooting with guns to shooting with cameras was challenging, but it has made our forest corridors safer for the Amur falcons. Their arrival has bridged the gap between policymakers and community leaders,\" said Phom, a recipient of the Whitley Award for biodiversity conservation in 2021. Adding an urban perspective, Usha Rajagopalan, a lake activist from Bengaluru, emphasized that the concept of Commons is equally relevant in cities. \"Commons are not just for rural areas or forested regions; they are crucial in urban settings too. To prevent people from returning to villages and transforming them into cities, we need to make our cities more livable,\" Rajagopalan said. The event featured prominent speakers such as Rajesh S. Kumar, inspector general of Forests, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC); Muniraju S.B., Deputy Advisor, NITI Aayog; Sudarshan Iyengar, Chairperson, Foundation for Ecological Security; Ranjan Kumar Ghosh, Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; and Zeenat Niazi, Chief Advisor, Circular Economy and Climate Resilience Programs, Development Alternatives.

Kumar stressed the importance of institutionalizing Commons at the sub-national level, highlighting the need for collaboration between government and communities. \"To address the challenges facing Commons effectively, we need high-level convergence and collaborative actions. India has immense local wisdom at the panchayat level, and engaging at the sub-national level is key to protecting Commons,\" he said. The Commons Convening, co-organized by partners including Common Ground, Foundation for Ecological Security, Landstack, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS)-Mumbai, UNDP India, and Collaborating for Resilience (CoRe), seeks to elevate the significance of Commons in public discourse, promoting civic engagement and inspiring collective action. India\\'s Commonsâ\\x80\\x94community forests, pastures, and water bodiesâ\\x80\\x94span over 205 million acres, accounting for a quarter of the country\\'s landmass. These resources are crucial for the livelihoods of over 350 million rural poor, providing food, water, medicine, firewood, and timber, while also offering essential ecosystem services such as clean water, fertile soil, pollination, pest control, and carbon storage. The degradation of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s Commons and the traditional governance practices that sustain them highlight the urgent need for collective action. The convening aims to connect Commons management to broader issues like local self-governance, decentralization, food systems, rural incomes, freshwater ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, and the rural-urban continuum. It also seeks to explore the synergy between community governance (Samaaj), government (Sarkaar), and markets (Bazaar) to address systemic challenges. With at least 37 sessions planned, the event will cover themes such as area-based planning, community-led governance, womenâ\\x80\\x99s leadership, coastal Commons management, and social accountability. These sessions, led by speakers from diverse backgrounds, will also explore enhancing the livelihoods of marginalized groups through the value addition of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and address the challenges and opportunities posed by the evolving dynamics of peri-urban areas. The Commons Convening seeks to create a platform for dialogue, collaboration, and collective action, fostering a shared understanding and vision for the future of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s Commons. It provides stakeholders with an opportunity to explore, connect, and coordinate initiatives that can lead to impactful and scalable solutions.',\n",
       "  \"HAMBURG (Germany): The first  Hamburg Sustainability Conference  (HSC) brings together politics, science and business as well as civil society and international organizations to develop solutions for the challenges of the times. Around 1600 participants from 102 countries discussed a wide scope of issues in more than 60 sessions: from sustainable  hydrogen supply chains  for  global shipping  to  fair raw material relations  for battery production and an  international financial architecture  that is fair for all. The aim of the conference was to develop concrete initiatives to accelerate the implementation of the  UN Sustainable Development Goals  jointly agreed by all countries of the world. The Hamburg Sustainability Conference was an initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Michael Otto Foundation and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. It will continue to take place in the coming years and thus initiate and support long-term change processes, stated the initiators of the conference.  The conference was opened by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Hamburg's First Mayor Peter Tschentscher as well as the Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Achim Steiner. Among others, the President of Namibia Nangolo Mbumba, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva, the Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley, heads of the state of nearly a dozen countries, Chadian civil rights activist and representative of the indigenous peoples Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim and Kenyan activist Mercy Mutana participated in the conference. The collaboration of representatives from politics, business, science and civil society from all parts of the world enables new alliances for concrete initiatives.  Development Minister Svenja Schulze said â\\x80\\x9cThe principle of  international cooperation  is under enormous pressure worldwide. In many countries, nationalists advocate for isolation and stir up fears about the future. That the global community managed to adopt a pact for the future in September in New York under these circumstances is therefore a victory for  multilateralism . We want to build on this and develop concrete answers to questions about the future through new alliances. The major challenges of our time cannot be solved in a national shell but only through international cooperation. First Mayor of Hamburg Peter Tschentscher said â\\x80\\x9cWith the international Sustainability Conference, Hamburg is making an important contribution to more sustainable global development. Our city itself is pursuing an ambitious SDG strategy. With Germany's largest seaport and around 100 consulates, we have excellent connections to all continents. We look forward to new concepts and new ideas for implementing the United Nations' SDGs.â\\x80\\x9d UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said â\\x80\\x9cComing on the heels of world leaders agreeing to the Pact of the Future on the margins of the UN General Assembly, the Hamburg Sustainability Conference is the first next step towards turning these global commitments into tangible action to steer our world to a more sustainable pathâ\\x80\\x9d.  Michael Otto, Chairman of the Supervisory Board Otto Group said â\\x80\\x9cThe major challenges of our time can only be addressed through close cooperation and a collaborative effort among politics, business, and society. The global consensus on the  Sustainable Development  Goals is, therefore, a significant achievement of multilateralism. However, these goals must be pursued with much greater urgencyâ\\x80\\x9d.  Future issues including how shipping corridors can be created and supplied with green hydrogen so that it is possible to travel in a climate-neutral way. How can batteries, which are so important for climate protection, be produced using raw materials that are themselves sustainably sourced. How can the international financial architecture be reformed so that it can support all countries in sustainable development. How can the enormous potential of the private sector and civil society actors be better utilized to achieve the global goals for sustainable development for all and what guidelines can politicians set so that the sustainability pioneers of today set the standards of tomorrow and many more were discussed.\",\n",
       "  'Landscape architecture  in Bengaluru is witnessing a transformation. The extent of  green spaces  in gated communities is rising. There is a move towards more  native plants . Open spaces are being used creatively.  Sustainability practices  are becoming common. And with many Bengalureans secretly harbouring the dream of living in the countryside â\\x80\\x93 drawn by its slower pace of life, connection with nature, and close-knit communities â\\x80\\x93 some projects on the outskirts of the city are integrating  rural elements  into the metropolitan environment. Kannan Somasundaram, principal landscape architect at Design Milieu, says apartment landscapes used to be targeted towards providing as many amenities as possible to cater to all age groups and varied functional needs of the community. But today, he says, there is greater focus on greenery and sustainability. â\\x80\\x9cAlong with function and aesthetics, environmental and ecological aspects are gaining more importance,â\\x80\\x9d he says. Charulatha Rangarajan, principal architect and founder of Upasarg, says todayâ\\x80\\x99s landscape designs provide for open outdoor spaces for individual activities like reading, listening to music, lounging gazebos, working pods (work from home/garden). They provide picnic spaces, with barbeque facilities, for small groups, and celebration spaces like amphitheatre and party lawns for larger groups.  â\\x80\\x9cKnowledge gardens with open libraries also find place in the modern community garden,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Radhika Bhat, design director in Earth Studio, says landscape design in apartments is seeing a rise in outdoor gyms, balcony planters and terrace level community spaces for recreation and exercise. Rohit Marol, founder of Terra Firma Landscape Architecture, also emphasises the role of landscape architecture in creating functional and aesthetically pleasing open spaces such as sit-outs, decks, pavilions, and water bodies including swimming pools. The inclusion of wooded areas, he says, enhances the aesthetics and functionality of the spaces. â\\x80\\x9cLandscape architecture is not just about planting trees and cultivating gardens,â\\x80\\x9d he says. And when you are planting gardens, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to select the right plants. Some of the favourites include frangipani, various types of lilies, heliconias, ribbon grass, and anthuriums.  â\\x80\\x9cThese plants thrive well in the cityâ\\x80\\x99s climate and add vibrant colours to urban spaces,â\\x80\\x9d Anjum Jung, principal architect and founder of Morph Design Company and executive director at Prestige Group, says. Plants such as aloe vera and snake leaf are advantageous for indoor environments due to their low maintenance and air-purifying capabilities.  The trend of incorporating indoor plants is growing as people look for ways to enhance their living spaces with minimal effort. Landscape architects are also increasingly incorporating sustainable practices into their projects. Sekar James, founder of Master Plan, has designed fully automated irrigation systems that provide bio nutrients, instead of chemicals. Prasad G, a principal architect at Dhruva Landscape Architect, uses treated sewage water for irrigation, he uses solar lighting, and local materials to minimise the carbon footprint. Prasad has worked on projects for corporate offices like those of SAP Labs and HCL in Bengaluru, besides numerous real estate projects. Some projects incorporate water bodies that aid in recharging groundwater and storing rainwater. â\\x80\\x9cOne of our projects in Devanahalli and another on Old Madras Road feature ponds used for storing rainwater,â\\x80\\x9d says Ajay Koshy, head of design and development at Brigade Group. Madhup Mazumdar, who was the executive landscape architect for the Kempegowda International Airportâ\\x80\\x99s Terminal 2 and is currently working on the landscape design of a green IT park in Bengaluru and a number of premium housing estates in the city, says the trend of developing villa communities on the outskirts of the city, nestled within nature reserves, is gaining traction.  â\\x80\\x9cThese â\\x80\\x98stay in the woodsâ\\x80\\x99 projects offer a unique blend of wellness, forest living, and self-sustaining eco-living, providing an escape from urban life and a chance to connect with nature, appealing to those who wish to cut off from the urban hustle and immerse themselves in nature,â\\x80\\x9d he says. Somasundaram of Design Milieu is currently overseeing a 15-acre project that includes a 3.5-acre space dedicated to a fruit orchard and an organic kitchen garden aimed at fostering  community involvement . â\\x80\\x9cThe produce will be shared among all residents,â\\x80\\x9d he says. The design also features a DIY (do-it-yourself) kitchen garden space specifically for children. Embassy Springs, a 288-acre township in Devanahalli, also exemplifies this trend. It features over 45 acres of open green spaces and seven large community parks. Tirupathi Rao Vaddi, chief finance officer at Inflow Technologies, lives in another similar project, Prestige Augusta Golf Village near Anagalapura. â\\x80\\x9cI am the happiest when I am in my green paradise,â\\x80\\x9d smiles Tirupathi.

       "  'This  , Hyderabad was abuzz with series of  community-driven initiatives  that highlighted the cityâ\\x80\\x99s commitment to  social causes  and  environmental sustainability . Residents from diverse neighbourhoods, including the IT corridor, Secunderabad, and Abids, gathered to make a meaningful impact through their collective action. One notable effort was led by  Ismaili Civic India  in partnership with the  Scouts and Guides of Secunderabad.  They spearheaded a  plantation drive  in Secunderabad, aiming to address the urgent challenge of  climate change  by enhancing green spaces and fostering environmental awareness.  In another initiative, the Karimabad Scouts and Guides organised a food donation drive at Niloufer Hospital, where meals were distributed to 150 patients. Iqbal Mandani, president of the Secunderabad Council, underscored the importance of these efforts: â\\x80\\x9cIsmaili Civic is a pan-India initiative dedicated to driving societal change through impactful actions. Independence Day reminds us of our duty to confront the challenges our nation faces. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a time to focus on our responsibility towards environmental conservation and social support.â\\x80\\x9d Beyond the plantation drive, Ismaili Civic also coordinated blood donation camps across 22 cities in the country, showcasing their commitment to community service. Meanwhile, the Hyderabad Cycling Revolution (HCR) marked the day with a â\\x80\\x98Freedom Rideâ\\x80\\x99 from Madhapur to T Hub, attract ing over 150 cyclists. This event aimed to promote active mobility as a solution to urban pollution. Ravi Sambari from HCR highlighted their mission: â\\x80\\x9cOur initiative encourages people to walk for distances under one or two kilometres, use bicycles for trips up to five kilometres, and opt for public transport for longer journeys.  This approach not only reduces pollution but also promotes a healthier lifestyle.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       "  'HAMBURG: The  Hamburg Sustainability Conference  intends to build bridges between all those who are needed to solve complex problems â\\x80\\x93 such as transforming and building a  sustainable shipping industry . The Alliance on  Green Shipping Corridors  formed at the HSC is an example for this collaborative effort.  Green shipping corridors that is routes on which it is possible to navigate climate neutrally, tank  renewable fuels , based on green hydrogen - can make a substantial contribution to achieving climate goals. The shipping industry is responsible for over 80% of CO2-emissions of global trade and emits more greenhouse gas than Germany as a whole - and it will continue to grow.  The new Alliance on  decarbonizing global shipping  can make a substantial contribution to achieving our climate goals by jointly establishing green shipping corridors. The vision is to establish green shipping routes on which it is possible to tank or store renewable fuel that has been produced in a climate-neutral way.  This is a global challenge that can only be solved through international cooperation by a variety of actors that need to be on board: fuel producers, companies that can transport these new fuels, ports that offer the renewable fuels, shipping companies that buy them, ship builders that build in motors able to run with the new fuels, banks that support financing the needed investments and governments that provide the necessary environment for it.  Development cooperation can and will contribute to the solution: The German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development can point to a long tradition of very good cooperation, especially with countries that are regarded as the frontrunners in the production of green, sustainable fuels.  Development cooperation can thus function as a door opener for economic cooperation and sustainable development. In many of these partner countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, the conditions for producing renewable electricity are excellent. There is a special need for many of these countries to become key players in the rapidly growing global market for green hydrogen products. In addition, it is the chance for these countries to simultaneously advance their own energy transition, their local energy supply and domestic industry. For this to happen it is of particular importance to make the global hydrogen market a fairer and more equitable one than the fossil fuel world ever was. This means that from the outset other aspects of sustainable development have to be taken into consideration and be integrated into the new Green Shipping Corridors, such as ensuring that the local population also gets an affordable access to the new clean energy that is being used for hydrogen production, ensuring decent working conditions on hydrogen producing plants and safeguard the sustainable development of cities and communities around the new production sights. If done right, all actors along the value chain can profit from the great coordination effort for a global hydrogen ramp up: production countries in the Global South through development created by new hydrogen value chains, Germany and other European countries through stable and diversified supply relationships and businesses via chances for exporting hydrogen technology.',\n",
       "  'VIJAYAWADA:  Sri City , a leading industrial hub in the country, has taken a significant step towards  sustainable development  with the launch of its innovative SCORE (Sri City Online Resource Exchange) Portal. This web-based platform, unveiled on Tuesday, aims to advance  circular economy  practices within the industrial ecosystem. The virtual launch event was attended by environment managers and senior supply chain executives from various industrial units. Sudhakar G Reddy, Sustainability Expert from the University of Michigan, USA, was the Chief Guest. Mr Satish Kamat, President (Operations), presided over the ceremony.  P Venkateswaran, General Manager (Environment), explained that SCORE will establish an online network for resource sharing, provide material information, and support data analysis for environmental and economic impact. Sudhakar Reddy briefly spoke on the initiatives and operational schemes of waste minimisation and sustainability across the campus at the University of Michigan, we have all emerged from the concept â\\x80\\x98R3â\\x80\\x99 - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. He appreciated Sri Cityâ\\x80\\x99s initiative in launching the very useful portal. Ravindra Sannareddy, Founder Managing Director of Sri City, emphasised the portal\\'s significance, stating, \"Sri City\\'s zero-waste initiatives, exemplified by the  SCORE Portal , underscore its leadership in sustainability and set a benchmark for other industrial zones.\" As a vital component of Sri City\\'s zero-waste strategy, the SCORE Portal will serve as an information network for listing and exchanging unused or excess materials. This initiative aims to address the common challenge of accumulating surplus materials faced by many companies, promoting a culture of reduce, reuse, and recycle among the industrial community. The portal will facilitate connections between companies with excess resources and those in need, optimising resource utilisation and minimising waste. It is important to note that the SCORE Portal is designed solely for information exchange and does not facilitate commercial transactions. With this launch, Sri City further solidifies its position as a frontrunner in promoting sustainable practices and combating climate change through circular economy principles. The implementation of this model has already resulted in improved waste management systems, recycling programs, and the incorporation of sustainable practices across numerous industries within Sri City.',\n",
       "  'Nagpur: The   organised by the Paschim Nagariya Bengali Cultural Association ( PNBCA ) at Ladies Club Lawn, in Civil Lines, stands out in city year after year, thanks to the deep sense of  community bonding  among its members. With just 44 members coming together like a close-knit family, the celebration is more than just a religious event â\\x80\\x94 it\\'s a testament to their shared commitment, camaraderie, and passion for maintaining their  cultural heritage . Patron Harishankar Dutta proudly describes PNBCA as â\\x80\\x98one big family\\', where the primary aim has always been to ensure that every member feels welcome, engaged, and comfortable during the five days of festivities, fostering a sense of belonging. President Abhik Palit emphasizes that this spirit of community is at the heart of PNBCA\\'s celebrations. \"We place great value on bonding. That\\'s why all events are organised and performed by our own members,\" he notes.  \"From managing finances and overseeing pandal operations to coordinating mahaprasad distribution and staging evening cultural events, every aspect of the celebration is handled meticulously by dedicated members, reinforcing a true spirit of togetherness and collective effort, said general secretary Somshubhra Sarkar and treasurer Gautam Sanyal in one voice. This year\\'s festivities, now in their 11th edition, reflect this collaborative spirit even more vividly. On Maha Saptami, members captivated the audience with a lively and well-received drama performance, and on Maha Nabami, they honoured the late music icon Bappi Lahiri with a special musical tribute, blending his classic hits with contemporary songs, much to the delight of attendees. Inaugurated on October 8 by DCP (traffic) Archit Chandak and his wife Saumya Sharma Chandak, CEO of Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited, the vibrant celebration will culminate on Dussehra, leaving behind lasting memories of unity, joy, and the enduring spirit of togetherness for the entire PNBCA family.',\n",
       "  'When her parents moved to Bengaluru, Pranavi Maruvada was just 10 years old. But she remembers vividly that the city then was evergreen and cool all day.  Seventeen years since, Pranavi knows it in her bones that the city doesnâ\\x80\\x99t feel the same anymore. â\\x80\\x9cThe lush green canopies I took for granted are now glimpses that bring nostalgia. The famed weather has changed, and itâ\\x80\\x99s gut wrenching,â\\x80\\x9d says Pranavi, who holds a postgraduate degree in dermatology. She admits sheâ\\x80\\x99s worried about  climate change . â\\x80\\x9cClimate anxiety is a thing because itâ\\x80\\x99s real,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Environmental sustainability  continues to be among the top priorities of  Gen Z  and millennials, says a survey that Deloitte did earlier this year.  â\\x80\\x9cSix in 10 Gen Zs (62%) and millennials (59%) say they have felt worried or anxious about climate change, up two points for both generations from 2023,â\\x80\\x9d the report says. Itâ\\x80\\x99s concerning that sometimes when thereâ\\x80\\x99s no need to develop, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a constant push to develop, says Varada Vivek, a 20-year-old undergraduate law student. â\\x80\\x9cSo, for that reason, cutting down trees without replacing them in the same locality, is not justified. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not correct,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Echoing Varadaâ\\x80\\x99s words, Namma Bengaluru Foundation general manager and environmentalist Vinod Jacob says the  BBMP Forest Dept  must ensure  compensatory afforestation  is done within 5km radius of where the tree is cut.  â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot compensate for the trees cut in Bengaluru by planting saplings in Kolar. Even if the law lets you do it anywhere in Karnataka, it wonâ\\x80\\x99t help increase the cityâ\\x80\\x99s green cover,â\\x80\\x9d says Vinod.  It is stipulated that compensatory afforestation must be done at a ratio of 1:10, which means for each tree cut, ten saplings are to be planted. If you ask BBMP Forest Dept officers, they would say it is a struggle to find enough space to carry out compensatory afforestation within the city.  â\\x80\\x9cThis year we have plans to plant 2 lakh saplings, of which we canâ\\x80\\x99t find space for 50,000. When it comes to compensatory afforestation, you need to find space for 10 saplings in place of each tree, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s not easy,â\\x80\\x9d says B L G Swamy, deputy conservator of forests.  The BBMP forest dept gets a host of requests to fell trees â\\x80\\x94 for being dangerous, to widen roads, build metro or rail tracks. All the eight zones under the department are managed by just 15 officers. â\\x80\\x9cThe temperature of a region depends on solar energy, and if there are entities like vegetation or water body, it acts as a heat sink because it absorbs heat,â\\x80\\x9d says Professor T V Ramachandra of IISc, explaining how trees play an important role in regulating the microclimate of a region.  When the vegetation cover was good in 1992, the temperature in the city was 21Â°C, but it kept increasing as the city gradually lost its green cover â\\x80\\x94 it became 24Â°C in 2000, and 28Â°C in 2010.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd today, itâ\\x80\\x99s 36 to 39 degrees Celsius. Still, it is not too late. Even if you wake up today, we can have the corrective measures,â\\x80\\x9d he adds. Professor Rao suggests a solution to the land-starved govt. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you acquire land for a road project, acquire slightly more than what is required, so that when you are clearing the trees on the side you can do the replantation (there itself) as it is done in China and other countries.â\\x80\\x9d Twenty-year-old Myrah, a design student, thinks that the way we are debating climate change should improve.  â\\x80\\x9cEven when you just consider the fact that thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot more dust in the air, the entire environment is changing, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot more pollutants, thereâ\\x80\\x99s absolutely nothing thatâ\\x80\\x99s being done to improve it.â\\x80\\x9d She thinks thatâ\\x80\\x99s because the ongoing conversations are not designed well. â\\x80\\x9cWhen schools talk about climate change, itâ\\x80\\x99s seen as an educational topic, but not something that theyâ\\x80\\x99re invested in.â\\x80\\x9d Myrah firmly believes that patchwork solutioning, like electric cars, is not going to undo any of the damage. â\\x80\\x9cBut at the same time, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think even planting trees is something thatâ\\x80\\x99ll do us much good. The only thing that can truly save us is building entire ecosystems.â\\x80\\x9d College-goer Deeksha PK says despite climate change affecting millions round the year, there is not much being done to stop its progress.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is creating anxiety among many, especially the farming community, as the climate has become extreme and unpredictable.â\\x80\\x9d She adds that though social media has helped in bringing in more awareness on the topic, it has also built up a lot of anxiety on the same.  Deeksha suggests that one must start acting at some point, and may as well start with a small step of planting trees in the locality one lives in. Sometimes it can be scary to think about what our world would look like in the next few decades, says Shreya G A, a 20 year old PR trainee.  â\\x80\\x9cSocial media undoubtedly creates a community and amplifies the message. However, I have observed that social media can leave one feeling overwhelmed, adding to the anxiety and despair. Another problem is the lack of verified information. It only makes it harder to understand better,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Pranav Sajiv, an engineering student, believes that  climate anxiety  is caused by genuine reasons and the adverse changes itâ\\x80\\x99s already causing.  â\\x80\\x9cPeople have finally started taking notice of the rapidly increasing temperature of our summers and the fluctuations in rain timings, and are valid for developing anxious sentiments towards our planetâ\\x80\\x99s wellbeing and humanityâ\\x80\\x99s future,â\\x80\\x9d says the 18-year-old. In a first, BBMP has begun to count the number of trees in the city. DCF Swamy is confident that the data will be ready in another six months.  â\\x80\\x9cWe are estimating it for the first time. It was supposed to be done seven years ago.â\\x80\\x9d  Tree counting  has been completed in at least ten wards so far. Prof Rao says, while studying satellite data, it was observed that there has been a continuous degradation in the cityâ\\x80\\x99s tree cover.',\n",

Kishco CEO Nohar Nath is not surprised by the trend. He started his  pre-owned clothing  website Kiabza in 2020. At the time of the lockdown, the company, which procured branded second-hand clothes from various sources on a consignment basis, used to get an average of 800 products a month. Post April 15, 2020, it shot up to 1,400.  In 2023, Nath called a halt to the business despite the â\\x80\\x9cgood numbersâ\\x80\\x9d. â\\x80\\x9cIt canâ\\x80\\x99t be denied that thereâ\\x80\\x99s still a massive amount of excitement around fashion resale and most of it fuelled by the demand driven by Gen Z. But itâ\\x80\\x99s a business that has not been able to scale,â\\x80\\x9d he says. This is a potent reason why this sector is now going local. The hyperlocalised narratives in thrifting fi nd a new lease of life via social media platforms, with Instagram being the real playground for thrifters. â\\x80\\x9cYet, the charm of physical stores cannot be de nied.  Increasing the availability of high-quality, well-curated thrift stores can help convince the hesitant ones to try it out,â\\x80\\x9d says Sahar Mansoor, founder and CEO of Bengaluru-based Bare Necessities, a  social enterprise  that produces zero-waste products. An avid thrifter, Mansoor says, â\\x80\\x9cBengalureans have always been very open to trying new concepts and ideas, making it the ideal place for entrepreneurs and creators.â\\x80\\x9d The cityâ\\x80\\x99s support for startups, its elevated levels of eco-consciousness and the drive to search for sustainable alternatives have resulted in the birth of many offl ine thrift stores and boutiques in recent years. Meghna Khanna, 46, shut down her Indiranagar-based store Levitate in 2020 and joined the Ulsoor-headquartered The Preloved Co, a charity-based startup founded by health coach Mariam Begg. She swears by the circular fashion traditions in India.  â\\x80\\x9cWe have been exchanging clothes for utensils and wearing hand-me-downs from our mothers and cousins and elder sisters for years. With the rise of nuclear families, the circularity was affected. But now, women are at the forefront of thrift culture. A woman today needs an extensive wardrobe to assume multiple roles, whether itâ\\x80\\x99s for a board meeting on a Monday, or a Friday night out with the girls,â\\x80\\x9d she says. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that the fashion industry accounts for 2% to 8% of global carbon emissions. That fashion has a sustainability issue is self-evident. Fashion resale, on the other hand, has a profi t problem.  To counter this, Khanna started focusing on vibrant curations, themed displays and building narratives leveraging Instagram. â\\x80\\x9cPre-Covid, it was diffi cult to get people to part with their old clothes but post-Covid, people are starting to realise that feeling lighter (in their closets) made them feel better,â\\x80\\x9d she says. If  clothing donations  are anything to go by, thrift is the way to go. Devyani should know. The 48-year-old started Re-store â\\x80\\x94 a thrift shop in Whitefi eld selling â\\x80\\x98gently-used goodsâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94 eight years ago after a heavy rainfall affected the neighbouring hutmills. She called for a donation drive for clothes and received enough to fi ll a two-storey store.  She set up a small place with a â\\x80\\x98buy at whatever priceâ\\x80\\x99 model and purposely chose a semi-rural area. She now has an Instagram page that helps supplement her charity work. â\\x80\\x9cToday, we get orders from Udupi, Indore, Hubballi and Mysuru among other tier-2 cities,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Though she admits that the stigma attached to  secondhand goods  still very much exists. â\\x80\\x9cCelebrity endorsements, visiting college campuses, pop-ups, swaps, collaborations etc.  help make thrifting appear more trendy. It needs to gain social media currency,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Pai chimes in: â\\x80\\x9cIn order to normalise thrifting, stores really need to level up with other brands in the market.â\\x80\\x9d For Prerna Ponnappa, shifting her brand Thrift Therapy â\\x80\\x94 which used to operate from Beneath The Mango Tree in Benson Town â\\x80\\x94 to online channels earlier this year made operations smoother.  The brand helps supplement funds for her charities for girlsâ\\x80\\x99 education and the welfare of community dogs. She now liaises with 6 clutter free groups on WhatsApp, 3 times a week. â\\x80\\x9cYoungsters have a different mindset. They are more comfortable shopping online,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Twenty-seven-year-old Maya KV, a public policy graduate, turned to thrifting after she came across a few eco-conscious people on Instagram. â\\x80\\x9cHaving worn hand-me-downs from my cousins since my teenage years, the idea of preloved has always been familiar to me,â\\x80\\x9d she says, adding that she knows many who are, on the other hand, uncomfortable with the idea of buying â\\x80\\x98usedâ\\x80\\x99 clothing.  Alena Warrior, a 26-year-old marketing and brand strategy professional in the F&B sector, shifted to thrifting primarily because of sizing issues. â\\x80\\x9cAs someone whoâ\\x80\\x99s not on the skinny side, I fi nd it easier to spot fashionable clothes when I thrift, both online and offl ine. The thrift shops are more versatile in terms of the size range,â\\x80\\x9d she says. Prithvi Rao, one of the founders of now defunct wardrobe swap venture Exchange Room, says sheâ\\x80\\x99s happy thrifting is thriving now, compared to a decade ago when she started the offl ine event. â\\x80\\x9cWe always believed that if you treat pre-loved clothes with the respect they deserve, you can achieve fi rst-hand experience,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x97\\x8f The apparel industry churns out 100 to 150 billion items annually; production has doubled in the past two decades. Of this, only 1% actually gets recycled and 85% is discarded â\\x97\\x8f The industry generates 100 million tonnes of waste every year, predicted to rise by at least 50% before 2030 â\\x97\\x8f Globally, resale industry is growing at 5x the rate of overall commerce. Expected to reach $250 billion by 2027 â\\x97\\x8f The secondhand market is driven by young GenZ consumers, who favour brands that offer pre-loved items in addition to new products',\n",

       "  'Yesterday, the world celebrated International Car-Free Day, encouraging people globally to forgo cars for a day. By 2024, the number of cars is projected to reach 1.475 billionâ\\x80\\x94equating to one car for every 5.5 people, or 182 cars per 1,000 individuals. While this figure might seem large, the environmental impact is significant: a typical passenger vehicle emits around 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. When multiplied by 1.475 billion cars, the consequences become alarming.  Car-free cities  aim to reduce traffic congestion, lower pollution levels, and enhance overall quality of life. This movement promotes healthier transportation alternatives, such as cycling, walking, and public transit. Discover the various countries that have embraced this change. Car-Free Day is an annual event celebrated in many cities around the world to promote sustainable transportation and raise awareness about the environmental impacts of car use. On this day, local authorities often encourage residents to give up their cars for various modes of transport, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. The initiative aims to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and noise, while also promoting healthier lifestyles and community engagement. Car-Free Day typically features activities like street fairs, cycling events, and educational programs to inspire long-term changes in transportation habits. It\\'s part of a broader movement to create more livable and sustainable urban environments. Nestled at the foot of the iconic Matterhorn, Zermatt has been a car-free haven for as long as anyone can remember. Access for private vehicles is permitted only until TÃ¤sch, located 5 kilometres away. From TÃ¤sch, visitors can switch to a shuttle train that runs every 20 minutes to reach Zermatt. Once in the town, transportation options include walking, horse-drawn carriages, eTaxis, bicycles, and a free eBus that operates two routes: the skibus and the Winkelmatten bus. La Digue, a tranquil island in the Seychelles, is a place where time seems to stand still. With no traffic jams or honking horns, the best way to explore is by bike. The island\\'s main road offers scenic views and leads to the stunning Anse Source d\\'Argent, one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most photographed beaches. Visitors can also trek to Anse Coco, snorkel, or kayak in clear waters. For those with limited mobility, electric buggies are available to help navigate the island. Venice\\'s Centro Storico is renowned as Europeâ\\x80\\x99s largest pedestrian-only urban area. Built on a network of 126 islands, the city features over 400 bridges connecting various districts. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Venice attracts around 20 million tourists each year, all while remaining vehicle-free. In fact, locals have even considered banning rolling suitcases to maintain their peaceful, wheel-free environment. Lamu, home to one of the oldest Swahili towns, has outlawed cars entirely. Instead, donkeys provide land transport, while traditional dhows ferry visitors around the archipelago. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lamu boasts a rich history and features stunning architecture made from coral stone and mangrove timber. The Old Townâ\\x80\\x99s narrow streets and intricately designed buildings reflect a unique blend of Swahili, Arabic, Persian, Indian, and European influences. Fes el Bali, the larger of Fesâ\\x80\\x99s two medinas, is a remarkably preserved mediaeval city with over 13,000 historic structures. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981, it is likely the largest contiguous car-free area in the world. With some streets as narrow as 24 inches, the area is largely inaccessible to vehicles, making it a truly unique destination for visitors. Since 2017, the city centre of Ghent has been car-free, enhancing its mediaeval charm. The city offers a free park-and-ride shuttle, along with regular bus routes, tram lines, and even an electric boat service for eco-friendly mobility. Night buses and free transport for children under 14 further enhance the appeal of public transport in this vibrant university town. On the picturesque island of Hydra, cars and even bicycles are banned. The only way to navigate its charming alleys is on foot or via the islandâ\\x80\\x99s trusty mules. While mules may be slow, they provide a unique way to explore the island. Boats are the preferred mode of transportation to reach the more remote beaches.\\\\ Located just 75 miles from Amsterdam, Giethoorn is a postcard-perfect village without cars or paved roads. Known as the Dutch Venice, visitors can traverse the area by bike, boat, or foot over the many footbridges crossing its serene canals. The town\\'s name, which means \"goat horn,\" originates from the discovery of wild-goat horns by early settlers. Yelapa, a charming cove located in the Bay of Banderas, is completely car-free. Although a road leads to the outskirts, travel to and from the village is primarily by boat. In the 1960s and 70s, Yelapa became a haven for hippies, and today its laid-back vibe continues to attract visitors seeking a peaceful escape. The popular saying, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather have a palapa in Yelapa than a condo in Redondo,â\\x80\\x9d captures the island\\'s allure.',\n",

There's nothing like the charm of traditional  clay idols . You can also make one at home or opt for Ganpati idols made from  papier-mÃ¢chÃ© .  Tree Ganesha idols  are also a good option. These idols have seeds inside that grow into plants after immersion.  Ditch the plastic and synthetic decorations this year. Get creative with natural items like flowers, leaves, and jute. You can also make your own decor using recycled paper, cloth flowers etc. Instead of synthetic colours, use natural materials like rice flour, turmeric, flower petals, and seeds to create your designs. These materials are biodegradable and the seeds can also serve as food for insects or birds later. Consider purchasing your idols, decorations, and festival supplies from local artisans and vendors. It supports the local economy and reduces the carbon footprint associated with mass-produced, imported goods. You can also organise or participate in community events such as tree planting drives, clean-up initiatives, or recycling workshops during the festival.\",\n",

       "  'Private investment  is showing encouraging signs on the back of rising business optimism and a pick up in  consumption demand  during the ongoing festival season, according to the Reserve Bank\\'s October Bulletin released on Monday. In India, the aggregate demand is poised to shrug off the temporary slowdown in momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25 as festival demand picks up pace and consumer confidence improves, the article on the \\'State of the Economy\\' published in the Bulletin said. Further, rural demand is expected to get a boost from the improved  agricultural outlook . Private investment should pick up steam in response to signs of a pick-up in consumption demand and rising business optimism.  In India, aggregate demand is poised to shrug off the temporary slowdown in momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25 as festival demand picks up pace and consumer confidence improves.  The rural demand is expected to get a boost from the improved agricultural outlook.  \"Private investment should pick up steam in response to signs of pick up in consumption demand and rising business optimism,\" the article said.  With the financial sector ready to intermediate resources for productive investment, buffered by healthy balance sheets, and the government\\'s continued thrust on capex, the investment outlook appears bright.  The article authored by a team led by RBI deputy governor Michael Debabrata Patra said the global economy remained resilient in the first half of 2024, with declining inflation supporting household spending.  Stable growth momentum amidst monetary policy easing is becoming the prevailing theme across most economies.  \"In spite of geopolitical tensions, India\\'s growth outlook is supported by robust domestic engines,\" it said.  Some high-frequency indicators have, however, shown a slackening of momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25, partly attributable to idiosyncratic factors like unusually heavy rains in August and September.  \"Looking ahead, private investment is showing some encouraging signs in terms of lead indicators while consumption spending is shaping up for a festival season revival,\" the authors said.  The article further said recent data suggest that credit card transaction volumes have slowed as lenders are adopting caution in view of risks flagged in unsecured loans.  Incipient stress in the microfinance sector appears to have been driven by lenders\\' drive to disburse loans rather than borrowers\\' demand.  The self-regulatory organisation - Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN) - points to guardrails to mitigate asset quality challenges, such as capping a borrower\\'s loan repayment obligations at 50 per cent of the household\\'s income, limiting the number of microfinance lenders and capping total indebtedness.  Credit bureau data, the article said, indicate that retail credit growth has moderated as lenders have tightened personal loan supply.  It also noted that in the banking space, deposit rates are expected to stay elevated despite some slowing down of credit growth.  The article also said digital payment transactions are expected to gain from strong tailwinds with the onset of the  festive season , marked by mega e-commerce sales and rising demand from smaller towns and cities.  Increasingly, consumers in Tier 3 to 6 cities are using digital payment services daily.  \"These developments highlight the vast potential for driving adoption and ensuring sustained usage of digital payments at the grassroots level,\" it said.  Further, the article noted that liquidity conditions remain in surplus mode.  The Reserve Bank, it said, will continue to be nimble and flexible in its liquidity management operations and deploy an appropriate mix of instruments to modulate both frictional and durable liquidity to ensure that interest rates evolve in an orderly manner.  The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India.',\n",
       "  'Lucknow: Nearly 8.5 crore liquor bottles, packs and units were consumed in UP in a month with about 90% of the demand for country liquor, beer and IMFL being met through production units within the state. Home to 182 sugar mills, 88 distilleries and seven breweries, the molasses and grain-based alcohol and brew produced through these production units were carried forward to the retail market through close to 800 wholesale godowns or bonds. Having implemented an integrated excise supply chain management system, the department sat on a goldmine of data. With the demand and supply scenario touching the saturation point, the department explored various options on the table to increase its revenue.  Chasing a target of Rs 50,000 crore for the 2024-25 financial year, during the first half, the department was able to generate Rs 22,563 crore (between Apr 1 and Sept 30) as excise duty over  liquor sales . Caught in a paradox, a senior excise department officer said raising the bar further was not possible without finding new avenues. \"Promoting increased consumption of liquor among the youths inorganically is not a good idea. We must promote responsible drinking in society. Plus, we feel the elasticity of the price points is also right at the moment. Hence, we have to look at other options,\" said a senior officer from the department. Last month, the department approached the state govt to allow retail business through the 29,200 liquor vends across the state until 11pm instead of 10pm. The move could result in additional revenue income of Rs 2,000 crore annually. \"But the govt rejected the idea,\" said an officer. As the next step, the department decided to hire a  data analytics  company to study the sales pattern and suggest ways to increase the revenue further. Excise commissioner Adarsh Singh said, \"We are planning to take a data analytics agency on board as has been mandated in the excise policy to augment revenue. Tackling incidents of illicit liquor and unauthorised liquor sales is also on the agenda.\" Pushing products that generate increased excise duty would be possible once the state-wide  liquor consumption  data is evaluated. While per litre sale of country liquor yielded about Rs 260 as excise duty on average, the consumption of the same quantity of IMFL yielded Rs 440 as duty fees. Moreover, a beer can (500ml) provided Rs 80 to the department as duty on average.',\n",

In accordance with the new Kerala  Marine Fisheries  Regulation Rules 2018 and recommendations from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), the minimum legal size of 58 fish species has been established to prevent juvenile fishing. The total marine production in 2018-19 was approximately 6.09 lakh tonnes (LT), but it experienced a significant drop in the subsequent two years. The production decreased from 6.90 LT in 2022-23 to 5.8 LT in 2023-24. Despite this decline, Kerala stands second in the country in marine catches, the minister added. Although marine production has decreased, Cherian said there has been a notable increase in the catch from inland fisheries, rising from 2.05 LT in 2019-20 to 2.51 LT in 2023-24.  Moreover, aquaculture production has witnessed substantial growth over the past five years, increasing from 0.25 LT to 2.10 LT.\",\n",
       "  'Indore: A significant surge in  rural consumption  has bolstered the demand for  kirana items  in  Indore , a prominent trade and supply hub for grocery products.  Higher crop yields and better remuneration from crop sales have elevated spending in the country\\'s rural regions, traders and suppliers said. Kirana merchants from the city\\'s bustling  Siyaganj market  reported that the demand for kirana items in Indore from rural areas has increased and has surpassed the volume of previous festive season. Traders estimate that Indore\\'s  sugar consumption , which is currently around 6000 tonne per day, is expected to increase by another 8% during the festive month, while demand for edible oil, dry fruits, pulses, and grains is also expected to rise during the festivals. \"Rural purchases are expected to drive rural demand this season. Demand from rural parts of the state has increased sharply and is expected to rise further during the festive season due to higher crop production and better remuneration from crops,\" said Siyaganj Wholesale Kirana Merchant Association president Ramesh Khandelwal.  Indore is one of the oldest and most prominent trade centres, supplying kirana items within a 150-200 km radius. Traders have begun replenishing their inventories in response to increased enquiries and orders from rural markets in order to meet festive demand. \"We are anticipating a successful season and have placed larger than usual orders for the festive season. Although the next fortnight is likely to be slow due to \\'Pitru Paksha,\\' we anticipate increased purchases in the market after that,\" said Anand Agawal, a kirana trader from Siyaganj market. Siyaganj is one of Indore\\'s oldest kirana markets, with nearly 500 shops, while Malharganj, Malwa Mill, and Marothia Bazaar are other kirana wholesale markets in the city. ',\n",
       "  'In the era of being the fashion best, ever thought of how much it takes for the environment to make your wardrobe? And what happens to your clothes when you are done wearing it? According to the United Nations, fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, contributing to about 20% of wastewater and 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. Fast fashion refers to the rapid production of inexpensive clothing by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. This business model emphasizes quick turnaround times and low costs, leading to a culture of disposability where clothes are frequently discarded after a few wears. Sustainable fashion refers to a movement and process of fostering change in fashion products and the fashion system towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. It also involves examining the entire production process, from raw materials to the end consumer. Celebrities like Emma Watson have continuously shown their support for sustainable clothing along with Cate Blanchett, Kate Middleton and Alia Bhatt, taking a step towards practising the 3Rs, and re-wearing outfits at high-profile events to make a sustainability statement.',\n",
       "  'LONDON: Global fossil fuel consumption and  energy emissions  hit all-time highs in 2023, even as fossil fuels\\' share of the global energy mix decreased slightly on the year, the industry\\'s statistical review of world energy report said on Thursday.  Growing demand for fossil fuel despite the scaling up of renewables could be a sticking point for the transition to lower  carbon energy  as global temperature increases reach 1.5C (2.7F), the threshold beyond which scientists say impacts such as temperature rise, drought and flooding will become more extreme.  \"We hope that this report will help governments, world leaders and analysts move forward, clear-eyed about the challenge that lies ahead,\" Romain Debarre of consultancy Kearney said.  Last year was the first full year of rerouted Russian energy flows away from the West following Moscow\\'s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and also the first full year without major movement restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Overall global primary energy consumption hit an all-time high of 620 Exajoules (EJ), the report said, as emissions exceeded 40 gigatonnes of CO2 for the first time.  \"In a year where we have seen the contribution of renewables reaching a new record high, ever increasing global energy demand means the share coming from fossil fuels has remained virtually unchanged,\" Simon Virley of consultancy KPMG said.  The report recorded shifting trends in  fossil fuel use  in different regions. In Europe, for example, the fossil fuel share of energy fell below 70% for the first time since the industrial revolution.   \"In advanced economies, we observe signs of demand for fossil fuels peaking, contrasting with economies in the Global South for whom economic development and improvements in quality of life continue to drive fossil growth,\" Energy Institute chief executive Nick Wayth said.  Industry body the Energy Institute, together with consultancies KPMG and Kearney, has published the annual report since 2023. They took over from BP last year, which had authored the report, a benchmark for energy professionals, since the 1950s.  Fossil fuel accounted for almost all demand growth in India in 2023, the report said, while in China fossil fuel use rose 6% to a new high.   But China also accounted for over half of global additions in  renewable energy  generation last year.  \"China adding more renewables than the rest of the world put together is remarkable,\" KPMG\\'s Virley told reporters.  Here are some highlights from the report on 2023:  * Global primary energy demand rose by 2% in 2023 from 2022,to 620 EJ.  * Fossil fuel use rose 1.5% to 505 EJ, which accounted for 81.5% of the overall energy mix, down by 0.5% from 2022.  * Fossil fuel use did not increase in a single European country in 2023.  * Electricity generation rose by 2.5% in 2023, up slightly from 2.3% of growth the previous year.  * Renewable fuel generation (excluding hydro) gained 13% toa new record high of 4,748 terawatt-hours (TWh).  * Renewables\\' share of the overall energy mix excludinghydro was 8%, up from 7.5% in the 2022 report.  * Including hydro renewables accounted for 15% of the global mix.  *  Oil consumption  exceeded 100 million bpd in 2023 for the first time ever, following a 2% year-on-year rise.  * Oil supply growth was met by non-OPEC+ producers, with US output gaining 9% on the year.  * China overtook the US as the country with the largest refining capacity in the world last year at 18.5 million bpd, though refining volumes still lagged behind at 82% utilisation vs the US\\' 87%.  * Global gasoline consumption hit 25 million bpd last year, just above its 2019 pre-pandemic level.  * Biofuels production increased by 8% to 2.1 million bpd in2023, driven by gains in the US and Brazil.  * The US, Brazil, and Europe accounted for 80% of global biofuels consumption.  * Global  gas production  and consumption remained relatively flat on the year in 2023.  * LNG supply rose by almost 2% to 549 billion cubic metres (bcm).  * The US overtook Qatar as the leading global supplier of LNG after a 10% rise in production.  * Overall European gas demand was down 7% on the year in2023.  * Russia\\'s share of European gas supply was just 15% in2023, from 45% in 2021.  * Coal consumption hit a new high of 164 EJ in 2023, up 1.6% on the year, driven by China and India.  * India\\'s coal consumption exceeded that of Europe and North America combined.  * US coal consumption fell by 17% in 2023 and has halved in the last decade.  * The record high in renewable generation was driven by higher wind and solar capacity, with 67% more additions in those two categories in 2023 than 2022.  * As much as 74% of net growth in overall power generation came from renewables.   * China accounted for 55% of all renewable generation additions in 2023, and was responsible for 63% of new global wind and solar capacity.  * Emissions grew by 2% on the year to exceed 40 giga tonnes.  * Emissions rose despite the slight drop in fossil fuels\\' share of the energy mix, because emissions within the fossil fuels category became more intense as oil and coal use rose and gas held steady.  * The report notes that since 2000, emissions from energy have increased by 50%.',\n",
       "  \"We often ignore our health and do not think about it in the long run. We tend not to be careful when it comes to our physical and  mental health . We push ourselves harder everyday to meet targets and deadlines, we succumb to the demands and reliance of technology and we become a part of the rat race without realizing what it might cause to our health. Have you ever thought what less sleep might do to your body in a few years? Have you ever cared to put your thoughts in how bad is the one can of coke for your body? No! Here are a few things which you must read and share with your near and dear ones about how small acts of carelessness damages your brain. Physical activity is said to enhance cognitive functions such as memory and concentration. It is also believed to increase neurogenesis, or the birth of neurons. Lack of exercise may then lead to dullness in the mental capacity and even cognitive decline. Physical inactivity has also been linked to a higher level of stress and anxiety due to reduced levels of endorphins. This imbalance can be critical for disrupting mood regulation and overall mental health. Therefore, regular daily exercise is important for the maintenance of brain function and mental health. Continuous listening to loud music can result in damage to hearing and raise stress levels, which, in turn, can cause cognitive decline. The auditory cortex can become too worked up with the constant sound waves, since this part of the brain works to control focus and memory. The high-volume music will heighten the level of cortisol inside the body, which would directly affect mental health and cause anxiety. While music provides a number of benefits in terms of mood improvement and overall cognitive performance, it should be played with strict consideration toward volume to avoid hearing damage or, in general,  brain health . Overconsumption of sugar-rich foods can cause a lot of damage to brain health. Increase in sugar has been proven to be associated with impaired cognitive functions such as memory loss and poor learning ability. Sugar can cause inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which harm the cells of the brain and could even result in neurodegenerative diseases. A diet high in sugar can also lead to insulin resistance, which affects the metabolic functioning of the brain and leads to poor cognitive performance. Regular consumption of sugars also changes mood regulation and predisposes the individual to mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Keeping the consumption level of sugar in checked and keeping to a normal diet may ensure healthy brain functioning. Getting less sunlight causes issues with mental health as the production of serotonin and melatonin-the neurotransmitters that are vital for mood regulation and smooth sleep-will be disturbed. Sunlight increases serotonin levels and, therefore, enhances well-being with lower risks of depression. Without sufficient light, a condition referred to as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) might be triggered and exacerbate anxiety and depression. Besides these factors, reduced sunlight exposure can compromise the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D that is responsible for play-acting key roles in  cognitive function  and general brain health. According to many scientists, exposure to nature light tends to facilitate and maintain mental balance and cognitive performance. Chronic  dehydration  can severely impact brain health by impairing cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and overall mental clarity. The brain is highly sensitive to changes in hydration levels, and even mild dehydration can affect neurotransmitter production and brain cell communication. Persistent dehydration may lead to increased stress levels and reduced cognitive performance, making it harder to focus and process information. Additionally, inadequate hydration can cause headaches, mood swings, and decreased mental alertness. Maintaining proper hydration is crucial for optimal brain function and overall mental well-being, highlighting the importance of regular fluid intake for cognitive health. Chronic stress  has a profound impact on brain health, affecting both cognitive function and emotional well-being. Prolonged stress elevates cortisol levels, which can impair memory and learning by damaging the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for these functions. Additionally, chronic stress disrupts the balance of neurotransmitters, leading to mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. It also accelerates brain aging and can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Effective stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, exercise, and adequate rest, are essential for maintaining cognitive health and emotional stability, underscoring the need for proactive stress reduction strategies.\",\n",

       "  'Consumption of alcohol and its impact on the  liver  is a widely discussed topic in the health sector. The impact of consuming huge amounts of alcohol is known to all, but what remains unknown and unexplored is the data behind this. Alcohol-related liver diseases are rising, especially among young adults. As per a report published in the Journal of hepatology in 2023, liver disease accounts for two million deaths annually and is responsible for 4% of all deaths (1 out of every 25 deaths worldwide) and alcohol is one of the most common risk factors. Alcohol-related liver diseases and other chronic liver diseases account for more than 2% of the deaths in India. For instance, Goa Medical College data reveals that out of the 5,500 patients admitted every month, 25% could have alcohol-related issues. Since 2021, Goa Medical College has been seeing more than 300 deaths annually due to alcoholic liver disease. And the profile of the typical patient is changing too. A few years ago, patients in their mid-forties and fifties would get liver cirrhosis, but today, it isn\\'t common to see even men in their early twenties. The age of drinking has fallen. Also, the quantity of drink consumed in a single sitting by some is high,â\\x80\\x9d said senior psychiatrist Dr Rajesh Dhume, who is also a nodal officer at Drug Treatment Centre (DTC), North Goa district hospital told TOI.  The burden of liver disease, including cirrhosis, is increasing globally and in India. This necessitates creating awareness, knowing more about the liver diseases associated with alcohol, and ways to modify lifestyle.  Alcohol consumption  is a major concern globally. In 2018, a study published in the Lancet found that globally, one in three people drink alcohol (equivalent to 2.4 billion people), and 2.2% of women and 6.8% of men die from alcohol-related health problems each year, which is equivalent to 2.8 million deaths each year worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease, on the health risks associated with alcohol between 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries, published in the Lancet suggests that there is no safe level of alcohol as any health benefits of alcohol are outweighed by its adverse effects. 2.4 billion people worldwide consume alcohol and on average, each day women consumed 0.73 alcoholic drinks, and men drank 1.7 drinks. Alcohol exerts a multifaceted impact on the human body, affecting nearly every organ system and increasing the risk of various diseases and disorders. It is a ubiquitous part of many cultures worldwide and has a profound impact on the human body. From its initial consumption to its metabolism and eventual excretion, alcohol affects various systems and organs, sometimes with detrimental consequences. When alcohol is consumed, it rapidly enters the bloodstream through the walls of the stomach and the small intestine. Its effects begin to manifest as it reaches the brain, where it acts as a depressant on the central nervous system. This results in altered perception, impaired judgment, and reduced inhibitions, commonly known as intoxication. The extent of these effects depends on factors such as the amount of alcohol consumed, the individual\\'s tolerance, and their rate of consumption. Beyond the immediate effects on cognition and behavior, alcohol affects numerous bodily systems. It can disrupt the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure. Prolonged heavy drinking can contribute to the development of conditions like hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias, significantly increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Alcohol also affects the gastrointestinal tract, irritating the lining of the stomach and intestines and increasing the risk of conditions like gastritis, ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Chronic alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor for the development of gastrointestinal cancers, particularly those of the esophagus, stomach, liver, and colon. Moreover, alcohol impairs the body\\'s ability to absorb essential nutrients, leading to deficiencies in vitamins such as B12, folate, and thiamine. These deficiencies can have far-reaching consequences, contributing to neurological disorders like peripheral neuropathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and cognitive impairment. The immune system is also compromised by alcohol consumption, making individuals more susceptible to infections and impairing the body\\'s ability to heal from injuries and illnesses. Chronic alcohol abuse weakens the immune response, increasing the risk of infectious diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Alcohol\\'s impact extends to mental health as well. While it initially produces feelings of euphoria and relaxation, chronic alcohol abuse can lead to the development of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). These conditions can significantly impair an individual\\'s quality of life and increase the risk of self-harm and suicide. Furthermore, alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have severe consequences for both the mother and the developing fetus. Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), which encompass a range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive impairments, including facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral problems. While moderate alcohol consumption may have some purported health benefits, excessive or chronic abuse poses significant risks to physical and mental well-being. Education, awareness, and responsible drinking practices are essential for minimizing the adverse effects of alcohol on individuals and society as a whole.  Alcohol metabolism in the liver is a complex process that can have significant effects on  liver health  when alcohol consumption exceeds the liver\\'s capacity to metabolize it. The primary pathway for alcohol metabolism in the liver involves the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). ADH converts alcohol (ethanol) into acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct. Acetaldehyde is then further metabolized into acetate by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is less toxic and can be further metabolized into carbon dioxide and water for elimination from the body.  Acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of alcohol, is highly toxic and can damage liver cells. It reacts with proteins, DNA, and lipids, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. Acetaldehyde also impairs liver function by disrupting mitochondrial function, interfering with energy production, and inhibiting the synthesis of essential molecules. Alcohol metabolism generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as free radicals and peroxides, which can cause oxidative damage to liver cells. ROS are highly reactive molecules that can oxidize lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to cellular dysfunction and injury. Chronic alcohol consumption overwhelms the liver\\'s antioxidant defenses, leading to oxidative stress and further damage to liver tissue. Alcohol metabolism disrupts the normal metabolism of fats in the liver, leading to the accumulation of fat droplets within liver cells. This condition, known as alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), is an early manifestation of alcohol-induced liver damage and can progress to more severe liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. To create awareness around the liver and keep it healthy, World  Liver Day  is observed on April 19 every year. It was started by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in 2010. \"The liver, a critical organ in the body, carries out essential physiological functions such as detoxification, regulating metabolism, and producing vital proteins. It holds the distinction of being the body\\'s largest organ and plays a crucial role in purifying blood before circulating it throughout the body. Despite its pivotal role, liver health is often neglected, resulting in around 1.5 billion individuals worldwide suffering from various liver diseases annually, including fatty liver disease. Chronic liver diseases claim the lives of nearly 2 billion people each year. These statistics underscore the importance of adopting healthy liver practices to safeguard our liver health,\" says Dr Punit Singla, Director & HOD, Marengo Asia Hospitals Gurugram. Liver diseases may stem from various factors, spanning genetic predispositions to excessive alcohol intake and viral infections. \"Some tips for a disease-free, healthy liver are limiting alcohol consumption, Maintaining a healthy weight, Avoiding unhealthy foods, Getting regular check-ups, and timely vaccinations. Liver diseases can remain undetected for extended periods but may inflict significant harm in the interim or by the time symptoms manifest and the disease advances. This underscores the critical importance of routine evaluations of liver health, encompassing overall body health, to forestall the deterioration of liver conditions if they exist. Should symptoms of liver disease such as fatigue, jaundice, or abdominal discomfort arise, seeking prompt medical guidance is essential to address the issue as early as feasible,\" Dr. Singla recommends.  \"Here are some suggestions to help young adults moderate their alcohol intake: It\\'s important to know your personal boundaries; recognise the effects of alcohol on your body and adhere to them to prevent intoxication. Set limits for yourself by determining how many drinks you can have on any given occasion or week. To pace yourself and stay hydrated, switch up your alcoholic beverages with water or non-alcoholic ones to cut down on your overall intake,\" says Dr. Saibal Chakravorty, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine, Metro Hospital Noida. \"To avoid dangerously high levels of drunkenness and the risks that come with them, such as accidents and alcohol poisoning, avoid binge drinking. Keep an eye out for peer pressure and surround yourself with friends who appreciate your moderation when it comes to drinking. When drinking, schedule your transportation in advance, either by hiring a driver or taking public transportation,\" he added.  Balancing alcohol consumption with liver health is essential for minimizing the risk of alcohol-related liver diseases and maintaining overall well-being. Here are several strategies to help achieve this balance: Here are some key symptoms to be aware of:',\n",
       "  'Campa vs Coke, Pepsi:  Reliance Consumer Products  (RCPL) is intensifying the cola price war by expanding its Campa soft drink range to various new markets before the festive season, offering prices that are 50% lower than those of  Coca-Cola  and  PepsiCo .  In response, the multinational brands are ramping up consumer promotions at grocery stores and quick-commerce platforms, although they have not yet reduced their prices. Industry executives told ET that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are facing a dilemma: either drop prices and risk hurting profitability or maintain prices and potentially lose market share to a lower-priced competitor. Any pricing decisions, however, must be made in agreement with independent bottling partners. RCPL entered the Indian  soft drinks market , which is dominated by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, in 2022 by introducing the Campa range in various pack sizes and flavors at significantly lower price points than its established rivals in select markets. After a slow start, RCPL is now expanding the Campa brand across multiple markets, including southern states, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, at disruptive prices. An industry executive said, \"RCPL has hinged its FMCG strategy on affordable pricing across categories including beverages, biscuits, confectionery and detergents, at price points 30-35% lower than rivals.\"  This strategy aligns with the company\\'s internal policy of being \"consumer-centric\" rather than \"competition-centric.\"  For instance, Campa sells 250 ml bottles at Rs 10 each, while Coca-Cola and PepsiCo sell the same size for Rs 20. Additionally, Campa offers 500 ml bottles at Rs 20, whereas its larger competitors sell them at either Rs 30 or Rs 40. Ravi Jaipuria, chairman of RJ Corp, whose group company Varun Beverages is PepsiCo\\'s bottling and distribution partner, recently addressed an analyst\\'s question about the potential impact of Campa\\'s entry into the market. Jaipuria expressed confidence in the market\\'s growth potential, saying, \"We think every new person coming in has a chance to grow the market. Reliance is a formidable competition but they will have to put more investments, more plants, more visi-coolers and we are sure being Reliance, they will do a good job. The market is so large in India, with more investments the market will only grow much faster.\" Soft drink companies have been working to reduce the seasonal nature of their products by introducing new promotions and campaigns, particularly during the festive months of October to December, in addition to the peak summer quarter of April to June, which remains the most significant in terms of annual sales. According to a report released by global research firm Kantar in June, the consumption of bottled soft drinks in Indian households surpassed an annual penetration of 50% in 2023-24. The report stated, \"The bottled soft drink category grew 41% by MAT (moving annual total) in March \\'23 and continued to add more households and expanded 19% in MAT in March \\'24.\" Financial data accessed by Tofler, a business intelligence platform, revealed that Coca-Cola India reported a consolidated profit of Rs 722.44 crore in FY23, representing a 57.2% increase compared to the previous year. Varun Beverages also reported a strong performance, with a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,262 crore for the June \\'24 quarter, a 26% growth over the same quarter in the previous year, attributed to volume growth and improved margins.',\n",
       "  'The entire scenario of the beauty industry has taken a drastic turn over the past few years. Throughout history, hazardous substances such as parabens, formaldehyde, and synthetic scents have dominated the makeup industry and these chemicals have affected health by interfering with hormones, causing skin irritation. However, with time the focus has started to shift towards â\\x80\\x98clean beautyâ\\x80\\x99. Today people do not just mindlessly shop based on packaging and brand name. Ever since the pandemic, consumers have demanded much more transparency about the ingredients that are present in the products they use. Reports suggest that India is the third-largest consumer of vegan cosmetics in the world with an estimated consumption of US $1.5 billion. This shift is not just a trend but a response to increasing awareness about the potential health risks which are associated with conventional cosmetic ingredients and the environmental impact of their production. Vegan cosmetics are those products that are made without any animal-derived ingredients or by-products like beeswax, lanolin, collagen, and keratin. These ingredients are typically sourced from animals. Instead, vegan cosmetics rely on plant-based ingredients, minerals, and safe synthetic alternatives to achieve the same.  Choosing clean and vegan products offers environment-friendly benefits and boosts consumer attention while helping them achieve the perfect glow with the right product. Therefore, by eliminating these toxins, vegan cosmetics provide a safer option for consumers who are conscious of what they put on their skin. Additionally, the cruelty-free aspect of vegan cosmetics ensures that no animal testing is involved in the product development process. As sustainability continues to take centre stage with beauty products, today numerous beauty brands have shifted to producing vegan cosmetic products. Here are some essential steps to consider when selecting vegan cosmetic products: One of the first steps in choosing vegan cosmetics is to read the product labels thoroughly. Look for certifications such as \"vegan,\" \"cruelty-free,\" and \"toxin-free ingredients. These certifications indicate that the product does not contain animal-derived ingredients and has not been tested on animals. Also, make sure to familiarise yourself with common non-vegan ingredients to avoid, such as carmine (a red pigment made from crushed beetles) and gelatin (derived from animal bones and tissues). Conducting research is vital to understand the brands and products you are considering. Many reputable brands are transparent about their ingredient sourcing and production processes. Visit brand websites, read customer reviews, and check for third-party certifications from organisations like PETA, Leaping Bunny, or The Vegan Society. These certifications ensure that the products meet strict vegan and cruelty-free standards.  Before fully incorporating a new product into your beauty routine, it is essential to conduct a patch test. Apply a small amount of the product to a discrete area of your skin, such as the inside of your wrist or behind your ear, and wait 24-48 hours to see if any adverse reactions occur. This step helps to ensure that the product is suitable for your skin type and does not cause any irritation or allergic reactions. Today numerous brands are working towards producing beauty products that are safe, clean, and vegan. As a result, what began as a fad has gradually evolved into a way of life for people. Vegan products have now become a healthy and sustainable alternative to traditional beauty products. According to Statistics, the vegan cosmetic industry is set to increase at a CAGR of 3.53% by 2028 annually. As the availability of high-quality vegan cosmetic products continues to expand, the future of beauty looks brighter, cleaner, and more compassionate. And embracing this will not only benefit the skin but also the planet, making vegan cosmetics a win-win for everyone.

       "  'Cancer  is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is a complex challenge affecting millions globally. It claims many lives each year, but some risk factors are within our control. By addressing these modifiable factors through healthier lifestylesâ\\x80\\x94quitting smoking, eating nutritious foods, staying active, using sunscreen, and moderating alcoholâ\\x80\\x94we can reduce cancer incidences and save lives significantly. A new study published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, the flagship journal of the  American Cancer Society  close to 50% of all cancer cases can be prevented by making changes in 6 risk factors.  The study from the American Cancer Society has said: Lung cancer had the highest number of cancer cases (201,660) and deaths (122,740) attributable to evaluated risk factors, followed by female breast cancer (83,840 cases), skin melanoma (82,710), and colorectal cancer (78,440) for attributable cases and by colorectal (25,800 deaths), liver (14,720), and esophageal (13,600) cancer for attributable deaths. Large numbers of cancer cases and deaths in the United States are attributable to potentially  modifiable risk factors . Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer.  Smoking emerges as the most dominant modifiable risk factor for cancer, implicated in almost 20% of cancer cases and nearly one-third of cancer-related deaths. Its impact spans across several types of cancers, prominently lung cancer but extending to others like bladder, throat, and pancreatic cancers. The detrimental impact of tobacco smoke is multifaceted, from introducing carcinogens directly into the body to promoting genetic mutations and impairing immune function, thereby fostering tumor development and progression. Obesity is linked to higher risks of colorectal, breast (post-menopausal), and esophageal cancers, among others. Excess body weight is not just a number on a scaleâ\\x80\\x94it significantly impacts cancer treatment and outcomes in several profound ways. When we carry extra weight, our bodies undergo complex changes that can fuel cancer growth and make treatment more challenging. Excess body fat produces hormones and growth factors that promote inflammation and cell proliferation, creating an environment conducive to cancer development and progression. For example, in breast cancer, fat tissue can increase estrogen levels, which may stimulate hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Moreover, obesity can complicate cancer treatment itself. Surgical procedures may be more technically difficult and carry higher risks, such as wound complications or infections. Radiation therapy might be less effective in obese patients due to difficulties in targeting tumors accurately and increased toxicity to surrounding healthy tissues. Chemotherapy doses might need adjustment because drug distribution in fat tissue can alter its effectiveness. Fortunately, even modest weight loss can make a significant difference.  Alcohol consumption heightens the likelihood of developing cancers of the liver, mouth, throat, and breast. Its effects on cancer treatment are profound and often overlooked. The link between alcohol and cancer is well-established, with even moderate drinking increasing the risk of several cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, liver, breast, and colon. During cancer treatment, alcohol can interfere with the body\\'s ability to heal and recover. For instance, it can weaken the immune system, making it harder to fight off infections or recover from surgery. Alcohol also impacts how medications are processed in the body, potentially reducing the effectiveness of chemotherapy or increasing the risk of side effects. Liver cancer, in particular, is directly linked to alcohol consumption. Excessive drinking over time can lead to cirrhosis, which increases the likelihood of developing liver cancer. For those undergoing treatment for liver cancer, alcohol consumption can exacerbate liver damage and complicate recovery. Reducing alcohol consumption or abstaining completely can significantly improve cancer treatment outcomes.  Physical inactivity is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor for cancer. While exercise is well-known for its cardiovascular and muscular benefits, its role in reducing cancer risk is equally crucial. Sedentary lifestyles contribute to a higher likelihood of developing several types of cancer, including colon, breast (post-menopausal), and endometrial cancers. The mechanisms linking physical inactivity to cancer risk are multifaceted. Regular physical activity helps regulate hormones such as insulin and estrogen, both of which can promote cancer growth when levels are chronically elevated. Exercise supports a healthy immune system, crucial for detecting and eliminating early cancerous cells before they can proliferate. Physical activity plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy body weight. Obesity, often a consequence of insufficient exercise, is a significant risk factor for many cancers. Exercise helps to burn excess calories, reduce fat tissue, and maintain muscle mass, all of which contribute to a lower overall cancer risk. It promotes better circulation and oxygenation of tissues, which can reduce inflammationâ\\x80\\x94a common denominator in many chronic diseases, including cancer. Improved circulation also enhances the delivery of nutrients and removal of waste products from cells, supporting overall cellular health and resilience against cancerous changes. Incorporating regular exercise into daily routines doesn\\'t require extreme measures; even moderate activities like brisk walking, swimming, or cycling can make a difference. Small changes, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or scheduling short exercise breaks during the day, can gradually increase physical activity levels and reduce cancer risk. By prioritizing movement and regular exercise, individuals can significantly enhance their overall health and reduce their chances of developing cancer later in life. Infections like Human Papillomavirus (HPV) are directly linked to an increased risk of developing several types of cancer. HPV is a common virus transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, most often during sexual activity. While the body\\'s immune system can often clear HPV infections without any symptoms, persistent infections with high-risk HPV strains can lead to cellular changes that may progress to cancer over time. HPV is notably associated with cervical cancer, where nearly all cases are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV types. The virus can also lead to cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx (the middle part of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils). Vaccination against HPV has proven highly effective in preventing infections with the most common cancer-causing strains of the virus. The HPV vaccine is recommended for both boys and girls before they become sexually active, ideally between ages 9 to 12, as it provides the best immune response at this age. Regular screenings, such as Pap smears for cervical cancer, can detect precancerous changes early, allowing for timely intervention and treatment. \"These findings reinforce that the morbidity and premature mortality from cancer in the United States can be substantially reduced through broad and equitable implementation of known preventive initiatives, such as excise taxes on cigarettes to reduce smoking, screening for and treating HCV infection, and vaccination against  HPV infection ,\" the researchers have said. Reducing cancer risk through lifestyle changes involves practical steps that anyone can take. Start with quitting smoking, which is single-handedly the most impactful action. Seek support from friends, family, or cessation programsâ\\x80\\x94it\\'s tough but incredibly rewarding for your health. Next, maintain a healthy weight through balanced nutrition and regular exercise. Focus on a diet rich in colorful fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting processed foods, sugars, and fats. Stay active! Find activities you enjoy, whether it\\'s walking, dancing, or sportsâ\\x80\\x94it all counts toward lowering your cancer risk. Limit alcohol intake; moderation is key to reducing risks for cancers like breast and liver. Protect yourself from the sun with sunscreen, hats, and clothing to prevent skin cancer. Get vaccinated against viruses like HPV and hepatitis B, which can lead to certain cancers. Regular screenings and check-ups are crucial too; early detection saves lives. Always remember, small changes add upâ\\x80\\x94incorporate these steps gradually into your routine for lasting benefits. Your choices today can significantly impact your cancer risk tomorrowâ\\x80\\x94empower yourself with knowledge and take charge of your health!',\n",
       "  \"The rapid evolution of technology in recent years has catalyzed a notable shift in the  jewellery industry  towards  lab-grown diamonds . These gems, chemically and visually indistinguishable from their naturally occurring counterparts, are cultivated in controlled laboratory environments, presenting a compelling alternative to traditional mining practices. With a burgeoning demographic of socially conscious consumers, the appeal of these  environmentally friendly  and  sustainable  creations continues to grow. Lab-grown diamonds, also referred to as lab-created diamonds, undergo a fascinating process of cultivation. Beginning with a tiny diamond seed, these gems are nurtured in chambers replicating the natural conditions found deep within the Earth's crust. Through methods such as High Pressure-High Temperature (HPHT) or Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), carbon atoms are meticulously added to the seed over weeks or months, resulting in the formation of a genuine diamond crystal. Beyond their aesthetic allure, lab-grown diamonds represent a significant step towards  ethical consumption . The traditional diamond mining industry has long been plagued by controversies, including associations with child labour and the financing of conflicts in vulnerable regions. In contrast, lab-grown diamonds offer a guilt-free alternative. Compared to the significant ecological footprint of traditional diamond mining, the cultivation of lab-grown diamonds minimizes soil disturbance, air pollution, and carbon emissions. This evolving landscape reflects changing consumer sentiments towards cultured diamonds. Once viewed with skepticism, consumers now see them as a pathway to larger, more affordable gems, untethered from the ethical concerns of traditional mining. Lab-grown diamonds possess the transformative potential to democratize access to luxury goods. By providing comparable quality at lower price points, they broaden the appeal of high-end jewellery to a broader audience. This inclusivity mirrors the shifting cultural values towards affordability and diversity, enabling individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to revel in the elegance and prestige historically associated with diamond jewellery. Moreover, the growing acceptance of lab-grown diamonds signals a paradigm shift within the industry. Established jewellery brands and retailers are expanding their offerings to include these innovative creations, acknowledging their value and market potential. In tandem, India's robust manufacturing infrastructure and skilled workforce fortify its status as a key player in the thriving lab-grown diamond market. Leveraging its expertise in diamond processing, the country contributes to the production of top-tier synthetic gems, fulfilling the escalating global demand for sustainable alternatives. India stands out for its specialization and leadership in the certification of Type IIA diamonds through CVD technology. Conversely, HPHT diamonds, laden with metal impurities, are predominantly manufactured in China. Moreover, advancements in technology have significantly bolstered the appeal of lab-grown diamonds. Revolutionary innovations in diamond-growing techniques have yielded gems virtually identical to their mined counterparts, both in optical properties and chemical composition. This meticulous quality assurance not only reflects the essence of mined diamonds but also instills consumer confidence, driving the widespread adoption of lab-grown diamonds as the ethical and exquisite choice for discerning buyers. Consequently, this rising popularity of lab-grown diamonds opens new avenues for market growth and innovation, especially when it comes to larger solitaires (over 1 carat). In particular a much higher demand for lab-grown solitaires between 2-5 carats, along with the adoption of coloured diamonds. However, this shift also necessitates adaptation and strategic planning to navigate changing consumer preferences and competitive dynamics. With technological advancements and heightened consumer consciousness, these synthetic gems are not merely alternatives but heralds of a new era, where responsible choices meet timeless beauty. While India's market for lab-grown diamonds is currently nascent, its potential for expansion is undeniable, fuelled by shifting preferences and a steadfast dedication to sustainability. As we embrace these diamonds of the future, we pave the way for a brighter, more conscientious future in the world of jewellery. Inputs by By Ricky Vasandani, CEO of Solitario\",\n",
       "  'Indore: Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s  palm oil  consumption has increased to around 38 per cent of the total  edible oil consumption , said Asian Palm Oil Alliance ( APOA ) on Friday claiming increase in  domestic cultivation  of palm oil may cut down edible oil imports.  APOA is an apex edible oil industry association formed by five major palm oil importing countries India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal with an aim to promote cultivation of palm oil and safeguard the economic interest of palm oil and marginal farmers associated with cultivation of the vegetable oil.  Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s annual domestic consumption of edible oil is around 24-25 million tonne of which 9 million tonne is palm oil.  To meet the domestic demand, India imports around 15-16 million tonne edible oil annually, according to APOA. Atleast 9-10 million tonne additional edible oil is required annually to bridge the deficit in domestic demand. â\\x80\\x9cIndia is the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest importer of palm oil and is committed to becoming self-sufficient in edible oil production. Palm oil has been a staple in various food and non-food products in India for centuries. Though in recent years, misleading reports about its impact on health, nutrition and environment have surfaced, causing harm to marginal farmers and the economy,â\\x80\\x9d said APOA chairman Atul Chaturvedi. Under the National Mission on Edible Oils â\\x80\\x93 Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), govt of India is aiming to push production of palm oil to 1.12 million tonne, covering close to 1.0 million hectare by 2025-26.  â\\x80\\x9cWe have created an Indian palm oil sustainability standards platform and have asked the govt to adopt it. Despite its pivotal role, palm oil faces negative perceptions fueled by myths regarding its environmental and health impacts. These misconceptions not only harm the industryâ\\x80\\x99s reputation but affect the Indian economy. We along with an agri conglomerate are working with thousands of farmers who have taken palm cultivation in India,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr Shatadru Chattopadhyay, managing director, Solidaridad Asia, an international civil society organisation working to facilitate development of socially responsible, ecologically sound and profitable supply chains.  Industry players from the oil industry spoke about usage of palm oil and cultivation adopted by farmers in India in a conference held by Solidaridad, APOA and Solvent Extractorsâ\\x80\\x99 Association on Friday.  â\\x80\\x9cPalm oil gives 5-10 per cent higher oil production than other oil seeds and it can help India achieve self-sufficiency in domestic consumption because its consumption is growing significantly and economic costing makes it a perfect vegetable oil for consumption,â\\x80\\x9d said APOA secretary general Suresh Motwani.',\n",
       "  'After a long work week, weekends are usually a time to unwind and have fun with friends. The excitement of a night out often includes cocktails or a quick shot, but they come back to haunt us on a Monday morning. Headaches, nausea, and fatigue â\\x80\\x93 the dreaded  hangover  â\\x80\\x93 can turn a relaxing weekend into a struggle. This feeling, coupled with the looming work week, can make Monday mornings a nightmare. This can make it difficult to focus, reduce productivity, and set a negative tone for the rest of the week. However, by understanding the causes of hangovers and adopting some preventative measures including herbal formulations, you can enjoy your weekend and conquer the  Monday morning dread , even after a fun night out. Here are some effective strategies to help you bounce back and start your week off on the right note. When you drink alcohol, your body breaks it down into acetaldehyde, a compound that causes hangover symptoms. The build-up of acetaldehyde in your liver leads to headaches and nausea. Dehydration and loss of electrolytes also contribute to these symptoms. Preventing a hangover involves minimizing the effects of acetaldehyde and staying hydrated. Natural hangover remedies can help reduce the severity of hangover symptoms. Consider looking for herbal solutions that combine traditional wisdom with modern research. Effective natural remedies include key ingredients such as dates, grapes, Andrographis paniculata (creat), and chicory. These are rich in antioxidants that combat oxidative stress caused by alcohol.  While it is important to drink responsibly, natural remedies can assist you with the Monday morning dread. Additionally, you can always lean on over-the-counter anti-hangover products that are suitable for everyday use, clinically proven, and safe, which furthermore protect your liver and help you feel better the next day. Remember, however, that responsible drinking is always the best approach.',\n",
       "  \"There is much excitement in nutrition circles with the release of the latest edition of the  Dietary Guidelines  for Indians-2024 by the ICMR-NIN Expert Committee on May 8, 2024. While there is much to discuss about these guidelines, letâ\\x80\\x99s focus on fats and oils. Guideline 7 of the document states, â\\x80\\x9cUse oils/fats in moderation; choose a variety of oil seeds, nuts, nut cereals, and legumes to meet daily needs of fats and  essential fatty acids  (EFA).â\\x80\\x9d Evidently, a  healthy diet  does not need to be fat-free. Even diets aimed at weight loss do not recommend completely eliminating fats.  Fats and oils  provide fullness, satisfaction, and delay hunger. Despite this, for various reasons, this food group has acquired a bad reputation. It is important to understand that our fat requirements should be met from the foods we eat, including the fats/oils used for cooking. Almost all the foods we consume, whether cereals, millets, pulses, beans, or vegetables, contain some fat. Nuts, oilseeds, meats, and dairy products are particularly known for their inherent fat content. These fats, though not visible, are crucial for meeting our  nutritional needs , especially for essential fatty acids. The oils/fats used for cooking should be consumed in moderation to complement our daily nutrient requirements. Fats are known to be calorie-dense, but their metabolic functions are less widely understood. They play a major role in hormone production, gene expression, and cell signalling. Additionally, fats enhance the palatability of food by improving flavour, texture, and taste, which can sometimes lead to overconsumption. This is where Guideline 7 becomes essential. According to Dr. Neelanjana Singh, registered dietitian and wellness consultant, â\\x80\\x9cFats consist of fatty acids, categorised into three types: Saturated fatty acids (SFA), Polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). It's essential to obtain n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA from our diet, hence they are referred to as essential fatty acids. Maintaining the ideal ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA is critical and in our current diets very high levels of n-6 PUFA has become a concern.â\\x80\\x9d The guidance on trans fats (hydrogenated oils) is clear: avoid them actively. They are commonly found in many bakery items, ready-to-eat processed foods. Checking food labels can help avoid these fats. It's advisable to limit processed foods and prefer freshly cooked meals. While not downright harmful, saturated fats do become detrimental if consumed in excess. Fats like ghee, coconut oil, and palm oil are high in saturated fats. It's recommended to limit saturated fat to one part of the total fat intake (SFA: MUFA: PUFA ratio should be 1:1:1), allowing only a teaspoon of such fats in an adult's daily diet. The uniqueness of each saturated fat should be understood to leverage their properties. Coconut oil and ghee are used in certain therapeutic diets for their special absorptive properties.  Contrary to popular belief, palm oil or palmolein can also be part of the healthy balanced diet when consumed responsibly in appropriate amounts. Natural compounds present in palm oil, such as tocotrienols and beta-carotene, support cardiovascular health and provide neuroprotection. Palm is a stable oil at high temperatures, hence oxidative products are minimised when cooking. Moreover, Palm oil has 40% of its fatty acids as MUFA which are known to play a role in reducing atherogenesis (fatty deposits in the arteries). About 30% of the calories in a 2000 calorie diet should come from fat, which equates to approximately 55 grams, including both visible and invisible sources. The visible fat from  cooking oil  should be limited to 20-25 grams or 4-5 teaspoons per day, with only one teaspoon coming from saturated fats like ghee, palm oil or coconut oil. Virgin and  cold-pressed oils  are highly valued. Cold-pressed oils (kacchi ghani ka tel) are extracted without using heat treatment thus preserving phytonutrients, whereas virgin oils are obtained from the first extraction process, which may involve mechanical pressing with or without heat. Such oils can contain undesirable compounds such as gums, waxes, pesticide residues, aflatoxins and allergens. Refining oils removes these compounds, making them safer for consumption, but also reducing beneficial components like antioxidants and phytosterols. Heat, light, and air are the three enemies of fats. It's important to store fats/oils in dark containers, away from light and heat, with tightly fitting lids. After frying foods, filtering out food particles from the leftover oil is a must. This oil should be used only for low-temperature cooking (not for frying again) and consumed within a day or two. Repeated frying in the same oil generates toxic compounds. The belief that adding fresh oil to used oil will counteract any negatives is incorrect; it actually leads to quicker deterioration.  Balancing different kinds of fatty acids can be challenging. Dietitians can assess diets and suggest approaches to achieve this balance. Cooking methods that require little added fat, like steaming, boiling, poaching, sautÃ©ing, and grilling, should be preferred. Fried foods prepared in suitable oil may be consumed occasionally in limited portions. Let's not undermine the importance of this food group, but also be conscious of not underestimating the amounts consumedâ\\x80\\x94much of it is invisible! This awareness can lead to better health outcomes.\",\n",
       "  \"A newborn's nutrition and development is significantly enhanced by breastfeeding, which supplies antibodies and other necessary nutrients that strengthen the infant's immune system. Making sure there is a sufficient supply of breast milk can be a worry for many new mothers. A number of variables, such as nutrition, hydration, and general health, are important for milk production. Breastfeeding  promotes the supply and demand of milk, but specific foods and dietary habits might help maintain and improve an adequate supply of breast milk.  1. Oats: Oats, being high in fiber and iron, are thought to aid in the formation of milk. They give energy and support normal blood sugar levels, both of which are vital for breastfeeding moms. 2. Fenugreek: Traditionally, this herb has been used to boost milk production. You can drink fenugreek tea or add it to food to help induce lactation. 3. Fennel: Phytoestrogens found in fennel seeds and bulbs may improve milk production. One popular beverage among nursing moms is fennel tea.  4 Nuts and Seeds: Essential fatty acids and proteins found in almonds, flaxseeds, and chia seeds help improve the production of breast milk. They are a wonderful supply of nutrients and energy as well. 5. Milk and Dairy Products: According to Dr. Pallavi Vasal- Clinical Director Obstetrics and Genecology, Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram, â\\x80\\x9cProtein intake must be increased for the formation of milk, and consuming milk and other dairy products aids in this process. They also supply calcium, which is essential for the mother and the child.â\\x80\\x9d 6. Lentils: Lentils are a fantastic source of protein and can stimulate the production of breast milk. They are high in fiber and iron as well. 7. Porridge and Seasonal Millets: In addition to being nutrient-dense, these whole grains support sustained energy levels. They aid in the production of milk and are simple to digest. 8. Thoroughly Washed Green Veggies A healthy intake of vitamins and minerals is ensured by consuming a range of green vegetables. Cleaning thoroughly gets rid of any dangerous pesticides or bacteria. It's essential to stay hydrated if you want to continue producing enough milk. Throughout the day, nursing moms should make an effort to consume lots of water, herbal teas, and natural juices. For general health and maximum milk production, a diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables must be balanced. Increasing your consumption of milk, lentils, and almonds will help your body meet its demands for protein during nursing. Making sure there is an adequate supply of breast milk is a major responsibility for nursing mothers. A balanced dietary intake, staying hydrated, and include  lactogenic foods  in the diet can all help to dramatically increase milk production. Moms can give their babies the finest start in life by concentrating on certain nutritional practices, which will promote the growth, health, and well-being of their little ones.\",\n",
       "  'A recent   development has brought attention to  Patanjali Ayurveda , a company co-founded by the well-known yoga guru Baba Ramdev. The   has issued notices to  ,  Patanjali  Ayurveda, and the Central government following a petition that claims one of Patanjaliâ\\x80\\x99s products,  Divya Manjan , contains  non-vegetarian  ingredients despite being marketed as  vegetarian . This case has sparked significant interest and concern among consumers and regulatory bodies alike. The controversy centers around Divya Manjan, an herbal tooth powder produced by Patanjali. The product is labeled with a green dot, a symbol that indicates it is vegetarian. However, the petitioner, advocate Yatin Sharma, alleges that the product contains an ingredient called  samudraphen , which is derived from Sepia officinalis, commonly known as cuttlefish bone. This ingredient is of animal origin, which contradicts the vegetarian label on the product. Yatin Sharma, who belongs to a Brahmin community, has used Divya Manjan for a long time, trusting its vegetarian claims. He discovered the presence of samudraphen through recent research and was deeply distressed by this revelation, as his religious beliefs prohibit the consumption of non-vegetarian products. Sharmaâ\\x80\\x99s petition argues that this misbranding violates the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and has caused significant emotional distress to him and his family. The petition also highlights that Baba Ramdev himself admitted in a YouTube video that samudraphen is an animal-based product used in Divya Manjan. Despite filing complaints with various government agencies, including the Delhi Police, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, and the Ministry of Ayush, Sharma claims that no action has been taken so far. This lack of response prompted him to seek judicial intervention. On August 30, 2024, the Delhi High Court took up the plea and issued notices to Patanjali Ayurveda, Baba Ramdev, the Central government, and Patanjaliâ\\x80\\x99s Divya Pharmacy, which manufactures the product. Justice Sanjeev Narula sought responses from all parties involved, and the next hearing is scheduled for November 28, 2024. The courtâ\\x80\\x99s decision to issue notices indicates the seriousness of the allegations and the need for a thorough investigation. The case has raised broader questions about product labeling and consumer rights in India. The green dot symbol is widely recognized and trusted by consumers who follow vegetarian diets for religious or personal reasons. Any misrepresentation of this symbol can lead to significant breaches of trust and potential legal consequences for companies. Patanjali Ayurveda, founded by Baba Ramdev and  , has grown rapidly since its inception, offering a wide range of Ayurvedic and herbal products. The company has built a reputation for promoting natural and traditional Indian remedies. However, this case could impact its credibility and consumer trust if the allegations are proven true. The outcome of this case will be closely watched by consumers, regulatory bodies, and the business community. It underscores the importance of accurate product labeling and the need for companies to adhere to regulatory standards. As the legal proceedings continue, the focus will be on ensuring transparency and accountability in the marketing and labeling of consumer products.',\n",

Our work at the ISA directly supports the implementation of the Paris Agreement and contributes to the broader UN framework for sustainable development. ISA is working with Member Countries to help shape conducive policies to bring in investments in solar energy, a sustainable pipeline of solar-powered projects, and help build skills to sustain solar projects in the long term.â\\x80\\x9d To watch out for SolarX Startup Challenge, launched by ISA in collaboration with Invest India in 2022, at COP27 in Egypt, the challenge aims to foster entrepreneurship by supporting scalable and replicable solar energy business models in ISA\\'s Member Countries. The STAR-C initiative, launched in 2022 by ISA, UNIDO, and the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs, France, aims to build capacity and align skills with national training needs. It enhances quality infrastructure and standards for photovoltaic and solar thermal products to drive economic growth and job creation.  Global Solar Facility: launched in 2022, enhances solar investments in underserved regions, particularly Africa, using tools like the Solar Payment Guarantee Fund and Solar Insurance Fund.  The First International Solar Festival, launched in September 2024, brought together corporates, academia, youth, community leaders, and other stakeholders to exchange ideas, promoting creativity and international cooperation for a future driven by solar energy. The Assembly\\'s seventh session will be followed by â\\x80\\x98High-Level Conference on New Technologies for Clean Energy Transitionâ\\x80\\x99 on November 5. The Assembly proceedings will conclude on November 6, 2024, with a visit to a farm site on the outskirts of New Delhi showcasing the practical implementation of agrivoltaic systems. 120 countries are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 102 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.  The Seventh Session of the ISA Assembly will deliberate on initiatives of ISA that impact energy access, security, and transitions with a focus on: Empowering Member Countries to adopt solar energy as the energy source of choice. Make energy access universal by supporting solar entrepreneurs to scale up local solutions. Mobilise finance to speed up solar deployment.',\n",

Harris secured the  Democratic nomination  after President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election. The campaign has spent at least $3.8 million on private flights in just six weeks, according to a review of Federal Election Commission (FEC) records. The Harris campaign made payments to various private jet companies, including  Advanced Aviation  Team, Private Jet Services Group, Principal Aviation, and FlexJet between July 24 and August 30. The largest share of the payments went to Advanced Aviation, a company offering luxurious aircraft ranging from smaller jets for short trips to ultra-long-range planes with amenities and flight attendants for journeys up to 16 hours. Harrisâ\\x80\\x99 campaignâ\\x80\\x99s use of private jets has sparked criticism due to the significant environmental impact of such travel. According to the National Library of Medicine, private aviation is the most energy-intensive form of air travel, using 10 to 20 times more fuel per passenger than commercial flights. Harris has long positioned herself as a champion of climate action, referring to  climate change  as an â\\x80\\x9cexistential threatâ\\x80\\x9d to humanity. During a 2019 interview with CNN, she said, \"Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no question we have to be practical.

The participants took out a march from the ITO metro station to Delhi Secretariat, where participants presented their demands. They asked for immediate reduction in  greenhouse gas emissions , adequate policies to empower cyclists in Delhi, urban flooding and stormwater management in Delhi-NCR, adequate waste management policies, and imposition of hefty fines for improper waste management, as well as climate education and awareness. Swayansiddha Panda, a second-year student at Delhi University, said five trees are being cut down every hour in Delhi. \"Many of us are already struggling with respiratory issues and rely on medication. It is crucial for all govts to take immediate action to protect our forests and tree cover. We are here to demand the preservation of these natural oxygen towers, which will play a major role in our future and on our health,\" said Panda.

       "  'NEW YORK: Activists geared up Friday for protests around the world to demand action on climate change just as a pair of major weeklong climate events were getting underway in  New York City . The planned actions in Berlin, Brussels, Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi and many other cities were being organised by the youth-led group  Fridays for Future , and included the group\\'s New York chapter, which planned a march across the Brooklyn Bridge followed by a rally that organizers hoped would attract at least 1,000 people. More protests were planned Saturday and Sunday.  New York is hosting Climate Week NYC, an annual event that promotes  climate action , at the same time the U.N. General Assembly takes up the issue on several fronts, including raising trillions of dollars to aid poorer countries suffering the most from climate change.  The New York protest was to take aim at \"the pillars of fossil fuels\" - companies that pollute, banks that fund them, and leaders who are failing on climate, said Helen Mancini, an organiser and a senior at the city\\'s Stuyvesant High School.  Youth  climate protests  started in August 2018 when  , then an unknown 15-year-old, left school to stage a sit-down strike outside of the Swedish parliament to demand climate action and end fossil fuel use.  In the six years since Thunberg founded what became Fridays for Future, global carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels has increased by about 2.15%, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor carbon pollution. The growth of emissions has slowed compared to previous decades and experts anticipate peaking soon, which is a far cry from the 43% reduction needed to keep temperature increases to an agreed-upon limit.  Since 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from coal have increased by nearly 1 billion tons (900 million metric tons), while natural gas emissions have increased slightly and oil pollution has dropped a tiny amount, according to the International Energy Agency. That growth has been driven by China, India and developing nations.  But emissions from advanced or industrialized economies have been falling and in 2023 were the lowest in more than 50 years, according to the IEA. Coal emissions in rich countries are down to levels seen around the year 1900 and the United Kingdom next month is set to shutter its last coal plant.  In the past five years, clean energy sources have grown twice as fast as fossil fuels, with both solar and wind individually growing faster than fossil fuel-based electricity, according to the IEA.  Since Thunberg started her protest six years ago, Earth has warmed more than half a degree Fahrenheit (0.29 degrees Celsius) with last year setting a record for the hottest year and this year poised to break that mark, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European climate agency Copernicus.

Data revealed that  central India  alone accounts for 50,884 (50%) deaths.  The study was carried out by researchers led by Fakir Mohan University, Balasore, Odisha. Lightning, though a common natural phenomenon, especially during the monsoon, is less talked about, Professor Manoranjan Mishra of the university\\'s department of geography said, stressing that climate-induced extreme events were witnessing an increasing trend across India. He attributed increased incidence of lightning strikes to  environmental degradation ,  climate change , regional variability, high population exposure, geographical and climatic diversity, inadequate  early warning systems  and socio-economic factors. The study was meant to provide insights into the reasons behind patterns of increasing lightning fatalities and to contribute to the development of effective lightning protection systems, policies. Prof Mishra also said the significant changes observed in central India, northwest India and south peninsular India could be attributed to several interconnected factors.  Citing how the US, Australia and Latin America tackle lightning-related disasters, he said: \"We too can prevent lightning deaths with improved awareness and education. We need to have early warning systems and lightning-safe infrastructure in place. Also, increased investment in research and data collection and community engagement are key.\" The study explains that developing countries like India are well-prepared for cyclones, floods, and droughts, but ill-equipped to deal with lightning and heat waves. The study, published in the journal, \\'Environment, Development and Sustainability\\', said the Northeast, which has been experiencing changes in rainfall patterns, temperature and extreme weather events, has also seen a sharp rise in  lightning incidents  thanks to massive deforestation, depletion of water bodies, global warming.  The  National Disaster Management Authority  has instructed states and Union territories to prepare lightning action plans.  However, only seven out of the 36 states and union territories have come up with these plans so far. Most vulnerable states, including Telangana, MP, Odisha,   and Bengal have not yet prepared the action plans, the researchers said.',\n",

These women work on pertinent and diverse issues, including climate justice, nature-based solutions, climate technology, public engagement for climate, and climate-related health and food security, spanning regions and areas of expertise. The 2023 report â\\x80\\x98Feminist climate justice: A framework for action,â\\x80\\x99 by the UN Women points out that by 2050, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty and see 236 million more face food insecurity.  Though climate change significantly affects those working in the natural resource sectors, such as agriculture, its impact is not the same on men and women. Women happen to be more vulnerable due to various soci0-economic and cultural factors. Climate change also compounds the issues faced by underserved women and girls by deepening existing inequalities, disrupting education, health services, mobility and curtailing employment opportunities.  In India, where the effects are particularly pronounced, these challenges are compounded by regional vulnerabilities impacting underserved women and girls the most. This will deepen existing inequalities and disrupt education, health services, mobility, and even employment opportunities.  Recognising the pivotal role that women can play in driving effective climate action, the  Women Climate Collective  (WCC), a collective of women working in the climate or gender ecosystem, is strategically consolidating its efforts to amplify women-led initiatives. Their cohort highlights the unique challenges faced by women while also underscoring their contributions to the global climate discourse.  In 2023, the WCC programme built the capacities of 16 women  climate leaders , some of whom represented India on key global platforms including COP28 and were recognised through prestigious awards including Nidhi Pant who won the Earthshot Prize, Elsie Gabriel who received the face of India Achievers Award, and more.  KG Sreeja, who was part of the 2023 cohort, said, â\\x80\\x9cBeing part of the WCC cohort has helped in gaining a more granular gendered perspective of our work on co-creating community resilience to tidal flooding. It has helped in thinking and acting in gender specific ways over and beyond gender inclusive strategy and planning. Gender specific action has helped us identify the singular strength of women in the climate action space. It has become the natural progression from gender inclusive work and I strongly believe it is due to the work and networking I have been doing with WCC.â\\x80\\x9d  The leaders of new cohort will be provided tailored  leadership  training, communication, and access to international and national events, enabling them to participate in global climate discussions and showcase their work on an international platform. By elevating their groundbreaking work, the WCC platform aims to foster collaboration, networking, and knowledge sharing among the leaders, ultimately promoting  gender-inclusive  climate solutions in India. They will also have access to industry experts in the form of WCC Ambassadors, that will further support the climate leaders to grow and scale their efforts; Mamta Borgoyary, Executive Director, SHE Changes Climate and Shloka Nath, CEO, India Climate Collaborative, both prominent women leaders in nurturing climate action in India, will be supporting the new cohort of WCC women leaders.  Reflecting on the impact of the program, Mamta Borgoyary, Executive Director, SHE Changes Climate, shared her thoughts: â\\x80\\x9cThe WCC programme's unwavering commitment to fostering women's leadership in climate action is truly inspiring. The new cohort is composed of exceptional women dedicated to addressing critical climate issues, and I am thrilled to support them. I have witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of WCCâ\\x80\\x99s programs, and I am confident that these emerging women leaders will drive meaningful change and amplify their voices within India's climate ecosystem.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAs India faces repercussions of climate change - from floods, landslides to severe heatwaves, the urgency for a just climate transition is undeniable. Women, who are disproportionately impacted by climate change, facing higher risks of displacement, water scarcity and food insecurity must have equal opportunity to lead mitigation and adaptation strategies. That's why, for the second year running, the  Fondation L'OrÃ©al  welcomes 20 inspiring women to our Climate Collective. Because supporting women leadership in climate action isn't just the right thing to do â\\x80\\x93 it's the only way forward.â\\x80\\x9d says Rachel BarrÃ©, Fondation Lâ\\x80\\x99OrÃ©al Women and Climate program Director.

       "  'New Delhi: A state-level action plan to address climate change will concentrate on seven critical sectors:  energy and power ,  urban planning , water, forest and biodiversity, transport, agriculture and horticulture, and health. Each of the sectors will have respective mitigation and adaptation measures. Environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday announced that Delhi govt was in the process of finalising the plan. Rai said that while Delhi govt already had an existing climate change action plan in place â\\x80\\x94 it was implemented in 2019 and is set to remain in effect until 2030 â\\x80\\x94 the new action plan was essentially a revision of the previous one, as mandated by Centre. At a roundtable conference, chaired by Rai and attended by over 40 departments, experts and officials on Wednesday, the urgent need for action was highlighted, with the city facing unprecedented heatwaves and record rain. Rai said a comprehensive policy would be crafted and sent to Centre for approval. \"The way nature has been tampered with in the blind race of development all over the world has led to climate change globally, and now it has started having a direct impact on people\\'s lives. This year, the people of Delhi had to face heatwaves. Apart from this, the monsoon rains broke the records of the last several years. Similarly, we are also battling air pollution and are constantly working to reduce it. Today, policies are being made on climate change all over the world so that its components can be identified and controlled,\" he said. Rai said the pace of climate change had compelled govt to revise its policy. \"Delhi govt started the process of revising the policy of climate change two years ago. A core group was formed among different departments and stakeholders for this, under which several meetings were held. A steering committee was formed under chairmanship of chief secretary to finalise the proposal of the core group. That committee proposed a draft policy for climate change in Delhi,\" he said. He added that Centre was working on making this policy in the entire country in collaboration with German Technical Cooperation Group (Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ). \"This group helped us prepare the draft for Delhi. These 40 institutions, including IIT Delhi, GGIPU and Technical Energy and Research (TERI), along with various departments of Delhi govt and Centre, participated in this conference,\" Rai said. He said a proposal had been made to identify the sources of climate change in different sectors and devise a comprehensive policy, and Delhi govt was sending the same to Centre. A detailed action plan of the policy will follow soon after suggestions from Centre are received. ',\n",
       "  'At the UN climate conference in Baku, countries must agree on a new goal for international  climate finance  that truly meets the needs of developing nations, with  public finance  at its core, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said on Thursday. He said  COP29  must be the \"stand-and-deliver\" COP, recognising that climate finance is critical to saving the global economy and billions of lives and livelihoods from the devastating impacts of climate change.  Addressing a virtual event hosted by the Brookings Institution, Stiell said, \"At COP29 in Baku, all governments must agree on a new goal for international climate finance that truly responds to the needs of  developing countries ... It is not my job to prejudge what the new goal will look like. But it is clear public finance must be at the core.\"  He added that as much of this finance as possible should be in the form of grants or concessional funding and made more accessible to those who need it most.  \"And we must make climate cash count, wherever possible, leveraging more private finance and sending signals to financial markets that green is where the gains are,\" he said.  At this year\\'s UN climate conference (COP29), countries are expected to agree on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), the new amount developed nations must mobilise every year starting in 2025 to support climate action in developing countries.  Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, high-income industrialised countries are responsible for providing finance and technology to help developing nations combat and adapt to climate change.  These developed countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and EU member states such as Germany and France have historically benefited from industrialisation and contributed significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.  At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, these nations pledged to provide USD 100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries.  However, this target has not been fully met, creating a significant financial gap that has eroded trust and hindered climate action in developing nations.  In May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that developed countries had surpassed the USD 100 billion-a-year target by providing nearly USD 116 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2022, with nearly 70 per cent of the money provided in the form of loans.   Stiell noted that the countries could decide \"who pays and how much\" at COP29 in Baku but cautioned, \"We are not going there to renegotiate the Paris Agreement\", referring to efforts by some developed nations to broaden the list of countries contributing to climate finance, with Switzerland and Canada proposing criteria to expand the donor base.   Developing countries argue that discussions on expanding the contributor base go beyond the mandate for the NCQG and could derail negotiations on the new climate finance goal.   Some developed nations, led by the EU and the US, argue that the global economic landscape has changed significantly since the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. They suggest that wealthier nations that have emerged during this period, such as China and some Gulf states, should also contribute to the new climate finance target.   Developing countries view this as an attempt to shift responsibility away from those who have historically benefited from industrialization and contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions.   They argue that expecting them to contribute, especially when many are still grappling with poverty and inadequate infrastructure amid worsening climate impacts, undermines the principle of equity.   Stiell also stressed the importance of implementing mechanisms to track and ensure that promised funds are delivered.   \"More work also has to be done to rapidly ramp up funding for adaptation and get international carbon markets working for everyone. We must fund a new generation of national climate plans.   \"To protect the progress we made at COP28 and convert the pledges in the UAE Consensus -- to triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency, boost adaptation, and transition away from fossil fuels -- into real-world, real-economy results,\" he said.   The UN climate change chief warned that the world is at a moment of profound fracture between and within nations.   \"In times like these, there is a temptation to turn inward. A delusional belief that what happens in my neighbour\\'s backyard is not my problem or concern. If we go down this path, it will soon be game over in the world\\'s climate fight.\"',\n",
       "  'All   stadiums across the U.S. face huge financial loss threats due to global warming. As estimated by Climate X, a climate risk analytics firm, by 2050, the venues might experience up to $11 billion in damages due to  climate change . Such damages would translate into higher insurance premiums, higher prices for repairs and might disrupt both the local economy and league operations. Of the 30 stadiums analyzed in this study, many of them stand out particularly concerning the vulnerability to natural hazards brought about by flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat. New Jersey\\'s  MetLife Stadium  is the most vulnerable, with a total amount of projected losses standing at $5.64 billion, which was caused primarily due to storm surge and surface flooding, mostly surpassing the estimated value to replace the stadium. Also Read -  MetLife Stadium is expected to experience extreme future loss,\" said Austin Clack, solution engineer at Climate X. He further averred that the two major contributors to the loss include surface flooding and storm surge. The identification of these perils enables one to consider adaptation measures to reduce the possible damage. In California, the priciest NFL venue,  SoFi Stadium , is likely to incur approximately $4.38 billion in losses mostly from flooding. Similarly, the Arizona Cardinals State Farm Stadium may account for almost $965 million damages, bringing the three stadiums closer to nearly 30% projected losses in 2050. Climate X uses its Spectra platform to analyze risks from authoritative climate models. Even though this report gives ample insight, it is warning over the assumption and uncertainty of adaptations in the future. With the accelerated change of climate, continuous modeling has become the need of the hour. Also recent incidents such as hurricane Milton which devastated the Tropicana Field highlighted urgent risks from extreme weather. \"We have to reduce CO2 emissions to mitigate climate impacts,\" Clack said. Awareness constitutes the first step to resilience and real action, says Clack, and its failure in case of climate impacts will put the NFL in financial ruin since it is the most followed sports league in the world, both widely and lucratively.

These lands provide essential  ecosystem services  that support the livelihoods of billions globally. The brief emphasizes the urgent need to integrate the economic value of land commons into policy-making and land acquisition processes to ensure their sustainable management and protection. The COP 2.0, organized by Asar, Policy and Development Advisory Group (PDAG), and Damodar Bachao Andolan, focused on enhancing decentralized governance and the critical role Panchayats and Panchayati Raj Institutions can play in advancing  localized climate action plans . The consultation brought together stakeholders from various levels to discuss collaborative approaches to support locally-led climate initiatives. Drawing on data from the paper \"Valuing Ecosystem Services Provided by Land Commons in India: Implications for Research and Policy\" by Harpinder Sandhu et al., the brief highlights the pivotal role of Jharkhandâ\\x80\\x99s land commons in the state\\'s economy and environment. With a heavy reliance on agriculture and natural resources, Jharkhand is particularly vulnerable to climate change, affecting most of its 24 districts. Key Findings: The brief warns of the pressing threats to these commons, including overuse, degradation, and inadequate governance, leading to the loss of valuable ecosystem services and affecting the livelihoods of millions. It calls for legal and institutional reforms, sustainable management practices, and community-based management to protect these lands. Additionally, the report advocates for the inclusion of the economic value of land commons in state accounts and policy decisions, contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring the well-being of future generations. This brief is a crucial resource for policymakers, environmentalists, and community leaders, urging them to recognize and safeguard the socio-ecological and economic values of Jharkhandâ\\x80\\x99s land commons.',\n",
       "  'Dehradun: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankar urged urgent action on  climate change , biodiversity loss, and resource depletion. He was speaking at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Indian Institute of Petroleum in Dehradun on Saturday. He is on a two-day visit to Uttarakhand and will also visit Rishikesh and Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC) in Dehradun. He praised the institution for \"developing a patented single-step catalytic process to produce biofuel from plant-derived materials and waste\". He added, \"The world requires collaborative solutions to issues that threaten our existence and demand bold action. Challenges of climate change transcend borders, affecting vulnerable communities and ecosystems.\" Dhankar said the transition to  renewable energy  is vital, and India aims to become carbon neutral by 2070. \"We must also focus on optimal utilisation and preservation of natural resources, basing our usage on actual needs rather than financial means. Our economic progress must harmonise with  sustainability , in which science and research play a crucial role,\" he added. He highlighted India\\'s strides in quantum computing, green hydrogen, and 6G technology, cautioning against an overemphasis on govt jobs: \"Enormous opportunities are available in various fields through which  youth  can make contributions to national and global welfare.\" He stressed the need to \"de-silo govt opportunities\" and urged the youth to explore new areas. He added, \"India\\'s rise is assured because of the demographic youth power. All we have to do is keep national interest above partisan and self.\" He also asked the youth to stay vigilant against those who undermine democracy. \"It is concerning that threats to our democracy come from former leaders and those who held positions of authority. Vigilant sections of society, especially the youth, must expose them. The narrative that what occurs in a neighbouring country can happen here is condemnable. The challenges we face are daunting but not insurmountable,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'A new report from leading climate scientists has issued a new warning that Earthâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98vital signsâ\\x80\\x99 have reached â\\x80\\x98critical levels,â\\x80\\x99 with the â\\x80\\x98the future of humanityâ\\x80\\x99 hanging on a delicate rope. This comes from a 2023 assessment published in the journal Bioscience, which analysed 35 key indicators of planetary health and found that 25 have already declined by record levels, including rising   levels and rapid population growth. According to the scientists, the world is entering a new, unknown territory of â\\x80\\x98critical and unpredictable new phase of the climate crisis.â\\x80\\x99 The scientists call for immediate transformative measures to combat the  climate crisis  and emphasise on restoring the ecosystem.  Driven by record fossil fuel consumption, Earthâ\\x80\\x99s surface and ocean temperatures reached all-time highs in 2023. The report reveals that the global population is increasing by approximately 200,000 people each day, along with 170,000 new cattle and sheep. These trends are contributing to record greenhouse gas emissions, further intensifying  . The scientists identified 28 feedback loops, such as emissions from thawing permafrost, which could trigger catastrophic tipping points, including the collapse of Greenlandâ\\x80\\x99s icecap. Global warming is accelerating extreme weather events across the world. Hurricanes in the U.S. and heatwaves exceeding 50Â°C in India are exposing billions of people to dangerous levels of heat. The experts emphasise that without rapid, decisive action, the human toll will be catastrophic. \"Weâ\\x80\\x99re already in the midst of abrupt climate upheaval,\" said Professor William Ripple from Oregon State University, who co-led the report. \"Ecological overshootâ\\x80\\x94taking more than the Earth can sustainâ\\x80\\x94has pushed the planet into dangerous conditions, unlike anything humans have ever witnessed.\" Climate change  is already displacing millions of people, and the report suggests that hundreds of millions or even billions could be forced to migrate in the future. Such displacement could lead to geopolitical instability, and in the worst case, partial societal collapse. The report also notes that the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has reached record levels. Methane is 80 times more powerful than CO2 over a 20-year period and is emitted by fossil fuel operations, waste dumps, cattle, and rice fields. The accelerating growth of methane emissions is particularly concerning, according to co-author Dr. Christopher Wolf. Despite a 15% increase in wind and solar energy use in 2023, coal, oil, and gas remain the dominant sources of energy. The report attributes this to the strong resistance from industries that benefit financially from the fossil fuel-based system. The report also referenced a Guardian survey of hundreds of climate experts conducted in May 2023. The survey found that only 6% believe the world will keep global warming below the internationally agreed limit of 1.5Â°C. The researchers stress that avoiding even the smallest increases in temperature is crucial, as each tenth of a degree of warming could expose an additional 100 million people to unprecedented heat. The climate crisis, the report argues, is part of a larger ecological and social breakdown, driven by pollution, the destruction of nature, and rising inequality. The scientists emphasise that climate change is a symptom of deeper systemic issues, namely ecological overshootâ\\x80\\x94where humanity is consuming resources faster than the Earth can replenish them. Without transformative changes, these systemic issues could lead to widespread human suffering and the degradation of ecosystems across the planet. The scientists call for bold, transformative changes to combat the climate crisis. Among the policies they recommend are reducing the human population through education and empowerment for girls and women, restoring ecosystems, and integrating climate change education into global school curriculums. As nations prepare for the UNâ\\x80\\x99s COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan in November, the report concludes with a final warning: only through decisive action can we avert severe human suffering and protect future generations.

       "  \"A study by Punjab-based environmental researchers has exposed alarming levels of pollution in the Satluj that pose a significant threat to  water quality  and  aquatic life . The investigation revealed stark contrasts in water chemistry between upstream and downstream sites, painting a worrying picture of the riverâ\\x80\\x99s health. While upstream areas remain relatively unpolluted, downstream sites are plagued by moderate to severe pollution. The most disturbing finding is the excessive presence of  heavy metals  at downstream sites, which surpass critical thresholds and endanger the riverâ\\x80\\x99s ecosystem, underscoring the urgent need for action to mitigate pollution and protect the Satlujâ\\x80\\x99s water quality. River pollution has reached crisis levels in recent decades, with harmful chemicals, heavy metals, excess nutrients, and household waste contaminating waterways at an alarming rate. The Satluj in Punjab is particularly vulnerable, suffering from pollution caused by domestic and industrial effluents and agricultural runoff. A comprehensive study was conducted to analyse physicochemical parameters along the riverâ\\x80\\x99s course in Punjab during different seasons. The research focused on identifying seasonal distribution patterns of cyanobacteria, their relationships with water chemistry variations, and informing continuous monitoring efforts to ensure water quality. The Satluj originates in Himachal Pradesh and flows into Punjab near Nangal town, passing through Ropar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, and Kapurthala districts before converging with the Beas at Harike and entering Pakistani territory. For this study, the focus was on the portion of the river within Punjab. A thorough survey of the Satluj in Punjab identified eight strategic sampling sites: Nangal, Jol Village, Miani village, Katli, Ropar, Saidpur, Chak Dango, Chuharwal, and Talwandi Kalan. The findings of the study, â\\x80\\x9cSpatiotemporal Distribution of Cyanobacteria in Relation to Water Chemistry of Satluj River, Punjab (India),â\\x80\\x9d conducted by Gurdarshan Singh Rangra, Yadvinder Singh, Komal Thapa and Jasvir Inder Singh Khat- tar and Davinder Pal Singh has been published in the International Journal â\\x80\\x9cEnvironmental Monitoring and Assessmentâ\\x80\\x9d. The  River Pollution Index  (RPI) of various sampling sites along the river revealed significant varia- tions in water quality. Sites with minimal human impact, like Nangal, boasted an RPI of 1.5, indicating unpolluted conditions. Conversely, areas like Jol village exhibited moderate pollution, with RPI values ranging from 3.3 in summer and winter to 4 during monsoons, primarily due to sewage waste from Nangal City and the National Fertilizer Limited. Miani village and Katli, Ropar, recorded RPI values of 2.3 and 2.8, respectively, categorising them as negligibly polluted. Saidpur, Ropar, with an RPI of 3.3, faced contamination from agricultural runoff and Ropar City sewage. In stark contrast, Chuharwal, Ludhiana, and Talwandi Kalan exhibited alarming RPI increases, denoting severe pollution. Notably, Chuharwal marks the confluence of Buddha Nullah with the Satluj river, while Talwandi Kalan lies downstream. The substantial pollution spike at these sites underscores Buddha Nullah's significant contribution to pollutant levels. The study revealed a disturbing trend of increasing heavy metal concentrations along the Satluj River's course. Upstream sites (1-4) showed significantly lower levels of heavy metals, whereas downstream sites (5-8) exhibited substantially higher concentrations. This suggests cumulative additions of heavy metals and other pollutants as the river flows downstream from site 1 to site 8. Arsenic levels ranged from a low of 1.2Â±0.1 Âµg L Â¹ at site 1 during summer to an alarming high of 41.8Â±2.1 Âµg L Â¹ at site 8 during winter. Similar patterns were observed for other heavy metals, including cobalt, chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, iron, manganese, and zinc, underscoring the escalating pollution threat downstream. The heavy metal pollution index (HPI), a key metric for assessing aquatic heavy metal contamination, revealed alarming spatial and temporal variations across the Satluj river. HPI values ranged from 53.02 (site 2, summer) to 2820.18 (site 8, winter), exceeding critical thresholds at downstream sites. Upstream sites (1-4) showed relatively low contamination, with HPI values below 100 (53.02-147.04) across all seasons, indicating reduced heavy metal pollution and better water quality. This suggests minimal anthropogenic impact and effective natural filtration in these areas. Downstream sites exceeded critical HPI thresholds (103.08-2820.18) across all three seasons, signalling severe heavy metal pollution.\",\n",
       "  'A recent study has revealed that a vast reservoir of liquid water may be hidden deep beneath the surface of  Mars , possibly holding enough to cover the entire planet in a global ocean. This groundbreaking finding, based on data from NASA\\'s  InSight lander , suggests that the  Martian subsurface  might offer conditions conducive to microbial life, either in the past or present. The InSight lander, which operated from 2018 until its mission concluded in 2022, provided seismic data that helped scientists uncover this potential water reservoir. Located approximately 7.2 to 12.4 miles (11.5 to 20 km) below the surface, this water is trapped within fractured igneous rocks. At these depths, the temperature is warm enough to sustain liquid water, unlike the surface, where water would be frozen. \"Temperatures on present-day Mars become warm enough for stable liquid water near the top of mid-crust, and pores are expected to have closed at the bottom of the layer,\" the study said. Planetary scientist Vashan Wright from the University of California, San Diego, and lead author of the study, explained that the presence of liquid water deep within the Martian crust was determined by analysing the speed of seismic waves. These waves change speed based on the rock composition, presence of cracks, and what fills them. The data indicates that a mid-crustal layer of cracked rocks filled with liquid water best explains both the seismic and gravity data collected by InSight. Wright noted, \"If the InSight location is representative, extracting all the water from these fractures could fill a global ocean 1 to 2 kilometers deep.\" The discovery of such a vast  underground water reservoir  has significant implications for our understanding of Mars\\' history and its potential to support life. More than 3 billion years ago, Mars was a warm and wet planet with rivers, lakes, and possibly oceans. This study suggests that instead of escaping into space, much of that ancient water seeped into the crust. \"Large volumes of liquid water transiently existed on the surface of Mars more than 3 billion years ago. Much of this water is hypothesized to have been sequestered in the subsurface or lost to space,\" the study explains. Planetary scientist Michael Manga from the University of California, Berkeley, a co-author of the study, explained that the water likely infiltrated from the surface, similar to Earth\\'s groundwater processes. This historical movement of water suggests that the Martian crust could have been water-rich from its early history. The presence of subsurface water also holds promise for future human exploration. While Mars harbors ice at its poles, accessing this underground liquid water could be challenging due to its depth. Drilling to these depths is a formidable task, but researchers propose investigating regions like Cerberus Fossae, where geological activity might expel water to the surface. The findings from InSight\\'s data provide a tantalizing glimpse into the possibilities for  life on Mars . While the existence of water doesn\\'t guarantee life, it creates environments that could potentially support microbial life. The study, titled \"Liquid water in the Martian mid-crust\" was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and was authored by Matthias Morzfeld and Michael Manga and included contributions from researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and Berkeley.',\n",
       "  'It\\'s 2024 and what if tell you that life saving element, water, has been found on the red planet Mars. Sounds futuristic, right? Well, the Insights Lander which has been on Mars since 2018, has shown the presence of liquid water below the surface of the planet. Water is considered essential for life, and geological studies show the planet\\'s surface had lakes, rivers and oceans more than 3 billion years ago. The findings of the lander have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study has found that the volume of liquid water predicted beneath the surface is \"more than the water volumes proposed to have hypothesized ancient Martian oceans. Scientists hypothesize that water might have infiltrated from the surface to below just like it happens on the Earth. \"On Earth, groundwater infiltrated from the surface\" to deep underground, one of the authors, Vashan Wright of the University of California San Diego\\'s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"We expect this process to have occurred on Mars as well when the upper crust was warmer than it is today.\" The study found that large reservoirs of liquid water in fractures 11.5 kilometres (7.15 miles) to 20km beneath the surface best explained the InSight measurements. The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) was a NASA Discovery Program mission that placed a single geophysical lander on Mars to study its deep interior.  \"It addressed one of the most fundamental issues of planetary science: understanding the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner solar system (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. The mission ended in December 2022 after more than four years of collecting unique science on Mars,\" NASA says about this ambitious mission. InSight was launched on May 5, 2018. The red planet is a stubborn one in hiding secrets and scientists are curious enough to find it out. In 1996, NASA scientists published a paper outlining possible chemical traces of life-forms in a Martian rock that fell to Earth. Known colloquially as the Allan Hills meteorite, or by its official number, ALH84001, it had been collected in Antarctica more than a decade earlier. \"It contained chemical traces similar to those left behind by Earth microbes; some photographs even revealed microscopic features that looked something like bacteria,\" scientists have said. One of the major goals of the Mars 2020 mission was to find life on Mars, NASA says. The earliest attempt to reach Mars and study the possibility of life happened in 1960. After multiple failures, the first successful mission to Mars was NASA\\'s Mariner 4 in 1965, which provided the first close-up images of the Martian surface. Since then, several missions have followed, including NASA\\'s Viking 1 and 2 in the 1970s, which were the first to land on Mars and send back detailed images and data.  The 1990s saw the arrival of the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Pathfinder missions, which delivered groundbreaking information about Mars\\' geology and climate. In the 2000s, missions like NASA\\'s Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency\\'s Mars Express expanded our understanding of the planet.  The 2010s brought significant milestones with NASA\\'s Curiosity rover and InSight lander, each contributing valuable scientific data. India\\'s Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) in 2014 marked a notable achievement by making India the first country to successfully orbit Mars on its maiden attempt.  Currently, several Mars missions have been successful and some are still operational. India is a frontrunner in this ambitious mission. India\\'s Mangalyaan, officially named the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), represents a significant achievement in space exploration.

       "  \"Mornings set the tone for the rest of the day, and the habits we cultivate during these early hours can significantly impact our long-term health and  longevity . While there are numerous ways to start the day, focusing on practices that promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being can make a big difference. Below are five  morning habits  that can contribute to a long and healthy life. Mindful  meditation  is a practice that involves focusing on the present moment, which can reduce stress and anxiety. Research published in the journal Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging found that meditation can increase the grey matter in the brain, which is associated with improved memory, learning, and emotional regulation. Starting your morning with just 10-15 minutes of meditation can set a calm and focused tone for the day, helping you manage stress more effectively and promoting long-term mental health. Hydration is crucial after a night's rest, and starting the day with warm water and lemon can offer several benefits. Lemon water is rich in vitamin C, which supports the immune system, and warm water helps kickstart your metabolism. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition found that consuming lemon regularly can help reduce body fat and improve insulin resistance. This simple habit can aid digestion, boost your immune system, and improve your skin health, contributing to overall well-being. Physical activity  in the morning is a powerful way to boost your energy levels and maintain a healthy weight. A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercise enhances cognitive function and decision-making abilities throughout the day. Whether it's a brisk walk, yoga, or a quick workout session, getting your body moving in the morning can improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and increase longevity. Breakfast is often referred to as the most important meal of the day for a reason. A balanced breakfast rich in nutrients provides the energy and essential vitamins needed to start the day right. According to a study published in Circulation, eating a nutritious breakfast is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Go for foods high in fibre, healthy fats, and protein, such as oatmeal, nuts, fruits, and eggs, to fuel your body and brain for the day ahead. Cultivating a sense of gratitude in the morning can profoundly affect mental health and overall well-being. Research from the Journal of Positive Psychology shows that regularly practising gratitude can lead to increased levels of happiness, improved relationships, and a greater sense of life satisfaction. Start your day by reflecting on a few things you're grateful for, which can shift your mindset towards positivity and reduce stress levels, contributing to a healthier, longer life.\",\n",
       "  'The  James Webb Space Telescope  (JWST) has made a groundbreaking discovery that could change our understanding of the solar system. Using its advanced instruments, astronomers have found evidence suggesting that Ariel, one of Uranusâ\\x80\\x99 moons, might harbor a  hidden ocean  beneath its icy surface. Ariel, discovered by William Lassell in 1851, is the fourth-largest moon of Uranus. It has intrigued scientists for decades due to its unique geological features and the presence of   ice on its surface. The JWST, launched on December 25, 2021, has provided new insights into this distant moon, located about 2.9 billion kilometers from Earth. The discovery was made by a team led by Richard Cartwright from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. They used the JWST to analyze the light spectra from Ariel, which revealed the chemical composition of its surface. The data showed that Ariel has some of the most carbon dioxide-rich deposits in the solar system. This finding is puzzling because, at the distance of Uranus from the Sun, carbon dioxide should turn into gas and escape into space. This suggests that some biological process is replenishing the carbon dioxide on Arielâ\\x80\\x99s surface. One theory is that the carbon dioxide is being produced by interactions between Arielâ\\x80\\x99s surface and charged particles trapped in Uranusâ\\x80\\x99 magnetosphere. This process, known as radiolysis, involves ionizing radiation breaking down molecules and leaving carbon dioxide. However, the new evidence from the JWST suggests that the source of the carbon dioxide might be internal, possibly from a  subsurface ocean . The presence of a hidden ocean on Ariel could explain the continuous replenishment of carbon dioxide. If there is  liquid water  beneath the surface, it could interact with the moonâ\\x80\\x99s rocky core, producing carbon dioxide and other compounds that eventually make their way to the surface. This theory is supported by the detection of carbon monoxide on Ariel, which should not be stable at the moonâ\\x80\\x99s surface temperatures. The carbon monoxide would need to be actively replenished, indicating ongoing geological processes. The discovery of a potential subsurface ocean on Ariel is significant because it adds to the growing list of moons in the solar system that might harbor liquid water. Other examples include Europa and Enceladus, moons of Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. These moons are considered prime targets in the search for  extraterrestrial life  because liquid water is essential for life as we know it. The JWSTâ\\x80\\x99s findings have opened up new avenues for research and exploration. Future missions to Uranus and its moons could provide more detailed information about Arielâ\\x80\\x99s subsurface ocean and its potential for supporting life. The discovery also highlights the importance of advanced space telescopes like the JWST in expanding our knowledge of the solar system. The James Webb Space Telescope continues to revolutionize our understanding of outerspace. Its ability to observe distant objects with unprecedented clarity has already led to numerous discoveries, and its work is far from over. As scientists continue to analyze the data from the JWST, we can expect more exciting revelations about the mysteries of our solar system and beyond. Did you like this article?

       "  'BATHINDA: An international group of leaders and experts warns that unless humanity acts with greater boldness and urgency, an increasingly out-of-balance water cycle will wreak havoc on economies and humanity worldwide. In a report, â\\x80\\x98The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Goodâ\\x80\\x99, the Global  Commission  on the  Economics of Water  (GCEW) says the water crisis puts at risk more than half of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s food production by 2050. It also threatens an 8% loss of GDP in countries around the world on average by 2050, with as much as a 15% loss in lower-income countries, and even larger economic consequences beyond. Weak economics, destructive land use, and the persistent mismanagement of water resources have combined with the worsening climate crisis to put the global water cycle under unprecedented stress, GCEW says. Nearly three billion people and over half of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s food production are in areas experiencing drying, or unstable trends in total water availability. Further, several cities are sinking due to the loss of water below the ground.  â\\x80\\x9cToday, half of the world\\'s population faces water scarcity. As this vital resource becomes increasingly scarce, food security and human development are at risk â\\x80\\x94 and we are allowing this to happen,â\\x80\\x9d observed Johan RockstrÃ¶m, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and one of the Commissionâ\\x80\\x99s four co-chairs.  â\\x80\\x9cFor the first time in human history, we are pushing the global water cycle out of balance. Precipitation, the source of all freshwater, can no longer be relied upon due to human caused climate and land use change, undermining the basis for human wellbeing and the global economy.\" The report argues that existing approaches have led to the water crisis. They ignore the multiple values of water across whole economies and in preserving natureâ\\x80\\x99s critical ecosystems. The widespread under-pricing of water today also encourages its profligate use across the economy and skews the locations of the most water-intensive crops and industries, such as data centres and coal-fired power plants, to areas most at risk of water stress. Proper pricing, subsidies and other incentives must be used to ensure water is used more efficiently in every sector, more equitably in every population, and more sustainably. â\\x80\\x9cThe global water crisis is a tragedy but is also an opportunity to transform the economics of water â\\x80\\x93 and to start by valuing water properly so as to recognize its scarcity and the many benefits it delivers,â\\x80\\x9d said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the  World Trade Organization  and a co-chair of the Commission.  Current approaches also deal predominantly with the water we can see â\\x80\\x93 the â\\x80\\x9cblue waterâ\\x80\\x9d in our rivers, lakes, and aquifers. They typically overlook a critical freshwater resource, namely â\\x80\\x9cgreen waterâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 the moisture in our soils and plant life, which ultimately returns and circulates through the atmosphere, generating around half the rainfall we receive on land. A stable supply of green water is hence linked inextricably to stable patterns of rainfall, itself critical to economies and livelihoods. It also provides crucial support for the natural storage of carbon dioxide in the soil and mitigation of climate change. The water challenge becomes even more pressing when we recognise how much water each person needs daily to live a dignified life. The Global Commission offers a new perspective on a just access to water: While 50 to 100 litres per day is required to meet essential health and hygiene needs, a dignified life â\\x80\\x93 including adequate nutrition and consumption â\\x80\\x93 requires a minimum of about 4,000 litres per person per day. Most regions cannot secure this much water locally. Although trade could help distribute water resources more equitably, it is hampered by misaligned policies and the water crisis itself. The Commission argues that the crisis demands bolder, more integrated thinking, and a recasting of policy frameworks â\\x80\\x93 in short, a new economics of water. It begins by recognising that the water cycle must now be governed as a global common good. This can only be done collectively, through concerted action in every country, through collaboration across boundaries and cultures, and for benefits that will be felt everywhere.  Critically, we must redefine the way we value water properly to reflect its scarcity, while at the same time recognising the multiple benefits of water and a stable global hydrological cycle across economies. We must shape economies to allocate and use water properly from the start, and avoid having to fix problems such as water pollution and other â\\x80\\x9cexternalitiesâ\\x80\\x9d after the fact. The report calls for a fundamental regearing of where water sits in economies, enabled by a â\\x80\\x9cmission-drivenâ\\x80\\x9d approach. This paradigm shift requires the participation of all stakeholders, from local to global, to achieve the missions that address the most important challenges of the global water crisis.   Such missions would encourage innovations, capacity building and investments, and be evaluated not in terms of short-run costs and benefits but, rather, for how they can catalyse long-run, economy-wide benefits. â\\x80\\x9cWe must move beyond a reactive market-fixing approach toward a proactive market-shaping one that catalyses mission-oriented innovation and builds symbiotic partnerships around our biggest water challenges. Only with a new economic mindset can governments value, govern, and finance water in a way that drives the transformation we need,â\\x80\\x9d said  Mariana Mazzucato , Professor at University College London where she is Founding Director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP), and one of the co-chairs of the Commission. The report recommends five such missions: Launch a new revolution in food systems, transform agriculture to sustain the planet by scaling up micro-irrigation and radically improving water productivity, reducing reliance on nitrogen-based fertilisers, spreading regenerative agriculture, and shifting progressively away from animal to plant-based diets.  Conserve 30% of forests and restore 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030. Priority should be given to protecting and restoring those areas that can best contribute to a stable water cycle.  Capture the full value of every drop by treating and reusing wastewater, reducing distribution inefficiencies and recovering valuable resources.  Renewable energy, semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) are defining a new economic era. We must spur innovation with high ambitions and secure equity, sustainability and efficiency to ensure their growth does not exacerbate global water stresses or constrain the benefits they provide. Currently, over 1,000 children die every day from unsafe water. Ensure access to clean water for rural and hard-to-reach communities, including investing in decentralized water treatment and sanitation systems.  The Commission has identified critical enablers for the five missions, reflecting key aspects of this new way of governing, nationally and internationally to benefit people and the planet: Govern partnerships, property rights, and contracts for a just and sustainable water future. Forge more symbiotic partnerships and address legacy water rights using conditionalities. Shape finance for a safe, just and sustainable water future. Address public and private underfunding; redirect harmful subsidies; establish â\\x80\\x9cJust Water Partnershipsâ\\x80\\x9d to design, implement and finance transition towards a just and safe water future in low- and lower-middle-income countries.  Improve global water data infrastructure; promote corporate water footprint disclosure covering green and blue water, and value water as natural capital. Create a multi-sectoral Global Water Pact to address both green and blue water challenges and stabilise the hydrological cycle.  The Report calls for governments across the world to deliver a â\\x80\\x9cnew course for water at every scaleâ\\x80\\x9d and reinvigorate structures of international cooperation to address shared water challenges.  Tharman Shanmugaratnam , President of Singapore and one of the co-chairs of the Commission, said: â\\x80\\x9cWe can only solve this crisis if we think in much broader terms about how we govern water. By recognising waterâ\\x80\\x99s interactions with climate change and biodiversity. By mobilising all our economic tools, and both public and private finance, to innovate and invest in water. By thinking and acting multilaterally.',\n",
       "  'Most people want to have a job that makes them happy and have a good  work-life balance , and they strive for it their whole life. But considering the fast-paced world we live in and the hectic schedules people have, it seems to be a distant dream for many. More recently, a post regarding this has garnered much attention on social media. It makes one ponder over what leads to true happiness-- the lure of the corporate world or the simple farm life. In a recent tweet,  Blackmarsh Homestead , which is the official profile of a family living on an isolated farm in the Croatian lowlands, asked their followers a simple question which soon sparked an online debate amongst netizens. Their tweet which was posted on September 15 read, \"Would you rather make spreadsheets in someone else\\'s office, or haul manure on your own farm?\" and within 48 hours of being posted, it got roughly 5 million views and some 900 comments (and counting). This simple question about what kind of lifestyle one would prefer soon became a topic of debate amongst many. While the post got mixed reactions by people, it surely made one think about what  true happiness  means to them. Here\\'s what some of them said: Commenting in favour of working in the corporate world, X user named Triode replied, \"Spreadsheets hands down. People romanticize farming but itâ\\x80\\x99s not that great having to milk cows every day at the same time rain or shine, or if youâ\\x80\\x99re sick or well. Weeding gardens on your hands and knees is back breaking work.\" While X user Menandros said, \"I would rather not tire heavily my back and my arms again. Don\\'t romanticize harsh manual labor, it\\'s more gruesome than you believe and it will leave you absolutely destroyed.\" Another X user Curt K jokingly said, \"At least hauling manure on your own farm you know how much shit you\\'ll have to deal with.\" Talking about the many benefits of working on a farm, X user 3Sheepinatrenchcoat wrote, \"It doesn\\'t matter who\\'s farm it is, I\\'d take the manure any day. When compared to the exercise, meditation, and just overall freedom that comes with working outdoors, working in an office is a miserable affair. We weren\\'t designed for it and it destroys both mid and body.\" Whereas, X user Mapple shared his views on striking a fair balance between the corportae and farm lives. \"Done both, going back to spreadsheets (and IT in general) fulltime and parttime farm management ;) It\\'s a great way of life and can work if you either don\\'t need much money, or have a ton of money and can do it at a huge scale. Smaller scale and big mortgage etc doesn\\'t work :)\". Joe Coco, another X user, shared that his dream job is to have his own farm. \"I was an investment advisor for decades. I only did it so I could retire early, buy a farm, and grow my own food. Farming is in my blood. It is almost magical producing food from your own land\". Another X user Emma shared how her parents used to destress by being on the farm every summer. \"I see Finnish on her top! I think in my case, it\\'s a two wolves kinda thing. My parents had high ranking executive corporate jobs, but during the summer leave they\\'d chop firewood, renovate, carry water to the sauna, forage & empty the outhouse at our summer house for months.\" Netizens\\' mixed reactions to the post shows that while some people would prefer grinding in the corporate world and making more money, others would choose to have a simpler life on the farm. Well, to each their own as long as it makes them happy. What are your views on it? Would you rather grind in the office or work on the farm? Tell us in the comments below.',\n",
       "  \"NEW DELHI: The faecal levels, depicting  untreated sewage  and high-level pollution in the river  , reached an all-time high in September. This occurred even as the levels of  dissolved oxygen  (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which, despite being below standards, have slightly improved, thanks to the surplus rain in August. However, even the August rain couldn't improve the levels of  faecal coliform , which at its peak was a whopping 4,900,000 MPN (most probable number)/100 ml. This is 1,959 times higher than the standard of 2,500 units and 9,800 times the desired limit of 500 units. This was the worst pollution in the river, in terms of faecal coliform, since February 2022, when the faecal level at Agra Canal (one of the stations at the river stretch in the city) had reached 6,300,000 units. The faecal level in the river was assessed by the  Delhi Pollution Control Committee  (DPCC) for the month of September, a report of which was released on October 4, with samples collected on September 4. The report comes at a time when certain stretches of the river are already showing heavy frothing, a visible proof of pollution when mixed pollutants like surfactants and phosphates are churned out to reveal their presence, even if the DPCC doesn't test those parameters. Due to the surplus monsoon this year, which retreated on October 2, the river Yamuna managed to have a good flow as additional water was released from upstream. This, however, improved the status of dissolved oxygen, which depicts the presence of life in the river, or potential, throughout its stretch. As per standards, BOD must not exceed 5 mg/l, and DO must not go below 5 mg/l, which is the standard for outdoor bathing. While BOD depicts the capacity of water to clean itself, as it is the amount of oxygen required for water to treat organic matter in it, the faecal coliform, however, represents the presence of untreated sewage in the water. According to the DPCC report, at its entry to the city at Palla, the DO level was 8 mg/l, while the BOD was 3 mg/l, and the faecal level was 1,600 unitsâ\\x80\\x94all within the standards. However, as the river traversed further, the pollution load increased. By the time the river reached Wazirabad, the DO and FC were within standards; however, BOD had already breached the standards. At the ISBT bridge, the next point of analysis, both BOD and FC went beyond standards, and by the time the river reached the ITO bridge, all three major factorsâ\\x80\\x94DO, BOD, and FCâ\\x80\\x94were beyond standards. The condition of the river deteriorated as FC had reached a whopping 240,000 units, BOD 23 units, while DO was 4.1 units. As the river reached Nizamuddin, the FC reached 1,100,000 units, worsening further to 3,500,000 units at Okhla, 1,100,000 units at Agra Canal, and 4,900,000 units at the cityâ\\x80\\x99s exit after the confluence of Shahdara and Tughlakabad drains. Interestingly, due to the flow in the river, the DO, which in the previous month went nil or zero past the ISBT bridge, however, had some value even if it was below standard. â\\x80\\x9cThe source of high faecal coliform could be untreated or inadequately treated sewage from the STPs, sewage mixing through open drains coming from unauthorised colonies, intrusion or mixing of septage, faeces of animals, etc.,â\\x80\\x9d stated a senior official involved with the cleaning of the Yamuna river. Earlier in August, the highest faecal coliform level recorded was 920,000 unitsâ\\x80\\x94a substantial increase from the 160,000 units observed in July. The Times of India had earlier in September, referring to another DPCC report, stated that 56% of the  sewage treatment  plants in Delhi failed to meet the standards in August, the same as earlier in July and June. The Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) mostly failed to meet the standards for TSS, BOD, COD, and faecal coliform. The sewage treated from STPs often makes its way to the river Yamuna or is often used for horticulture.\",\n",
       "  'â\\x80\\x99s  Europa Clipper  spacecraft, which is robotic and solar-powered, took off on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket under clear skies. The US space agency\\'s launched this spacecraft from Florida to investigate whether the conditions on Jupiter\\'s moon  Europa  are suitable to support life, with a mission to focus on the large subsurface ocean that is thought to exist beneath Europa\\'s thick outer layer of ice.  The launch, originally scheduled for last week, was delayed due to Hurricane Milton. The probe was launched aboard SpaceX\\'s powerful Falcon Heavy rocket and is scheduled to reach Europa, one of Jupiter\\'s numerous moons, in approximately five and a half years. After a journey of approximately 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km) over 5-1/2 years, the probe is expected to enter orbit around Jupiter in 2030.  Over the course of three years, starting in 2031, Europa Clipper is set to perform 49 close flybys of Europa, approaching as near as \"16 miles (25 kilometers)\" to the moon\\'s surface. Operating in the vicinity of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, Europa Clipper will face a highly radioactive environment.  Jupiter is surrounded by a magnetic field that is approximately 20,000 times stronger than Earth\\'s.  This spinning magnetic field traps and accelerates charged particles, generating radiation that could potentially damage spacecraft.  To safeguard its delicate electronics from this radiation, Nasa constructed a protective vault for the Europa Clipper using titanium and aluminum. To reach Jupiter, Nasa has equipped Europa Clipper with over 6,060 pounds (2,750 kg) of propellant.  During the launch, the spacecraft was secured inside the rocket\\'s protective nose cone. Rather than following a direct route to Jupiter, the spacecraft will first fly by Mars and then return to Earth, utilizing the gravitational pull of each planet to gain speed, similar to a slingshot effect. The spacecraft\\'s large solar arrays, which were stowed for the launch, will collect sunlight to power its nine scientific instruments, as well as its electronics and other subsystems. The Europa Clipper measures 30 meters (98 feet) in width when its large solar panels, designed to harness the faint light that reaches Jupiter, are fully extended. The Voyager probes captured the first close-up images of Europa, one of Jupiter\\'s moons, in 1979, revealing intriguing reddish lines across its surface, despite the moon\\'s existence being known since 1610. In the 1990s, Nasa\\'s Galileo probe reached Europa and discovered strong evidence suggesting the presence of an ocean on the icy moon. The Europa Clipper, equipped with a range of advanced instruments such as cameras, a spectrograph, radar, and a magnetometer, will study the moon\\'s surface structure and composition, ocean depth, and salinity, as well as the interaction between the surface and the ocean. The mission aims to determine if the three essential elements for life - water, energy, and specific chemical compounds - are present on Europa. If these conditions are met, primitive bacteria could potentially exist in Europa\\'s ocean, according to  Bonnie Buratti , the mission\\'s deputy project scientist. However, these bacteria would likely be too deep for the Europa Clipper to detect directly. During a pre-launch briefing on Sunday, Nasa Associate Administrator  Jim Free  said that Europa presents one of the most promising environments for potential habitability in our solar system, aside from Earth. However, he clarified that this mission will not focus on searching for any actual living organisms. \"What we discover on Europa will have profound implications for the study of astrobiology and how we view our place in the universe,â\\x80\\x9d Free added. The deputy associate administrator of Nasaâ\\x80\\x99s science mission directorate,  Sandra Connelly  said: \"Scientists believe Europa has suitable conditions below its icy surface to support life. Its conditions are water, energy, chemistry and stability.â\\x80\\x9d Nasa official  Gina DiBraccio , ahead of the launch said: \"With Europa Clipper, we\\'re not searching for life on Europa, but we\\'re trying to see if this ocean world is habitable, and that means we\\'re looking for the water.â\\x80\\x9d \"We\\'re looking for energy sources, and we\\'re really looking for the chemistry there, so that we can understand what habitable environments might be throughout our whole universe,\" she added. If our solar system turns out to host two habitable worlds, Europa and Earth, \"think of what that means when you extend that result to the billions and billions of other solar systems in this galaxy,\" said Niebur, the Europa Clipper program scientist. \"Setting aside the \\'Is there life?\\' question on Europa, just the habitability question in and of itself opens up a huge new paradigm for searching for life in the galaxy,\" he added.',\n",
       "  ' In light of the increasing water levels in the Ganga River, the Bihar government has ordered the closure of 76 schools across the state. The decision, announced by District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh. As per the official notice, these schools will remain closed until Saturday, September 21, 2024. The schools affected are located in several blocks including Athamalgola, Badha, Bakhtiyarpur, Mokama, Sadar, Danapur, Fatuha, and Maner. These areas have been identified as being in the danger zone due to the rising water levels, and the order to close schools has been implemented immediately. According to the official notice from the Bihar Education Department, the decision to close the schools was made in accordance with Letter No. 677 dated August 24, 2024. This was issued following concerns over the potential threat to life and safety posed by the rising Ganga River, which has now crossed the danger mark. Meanwhile, the rising water levels have caused flooding in low-lying areas, exacerbating concerns for residents. The Central Water Commission has issued forecasts predicting further increases in water levels, leading the Water Resources Department to increase vigilance along embankments. Engineers and officials have been directed to patrol the affected areas at night to ensure the safety of the region.',\n",
       "  'NEW DELHI: A scientific revelation has sparked widespread fascination across social media platforms as researchers unveil the existence of a  colossal ocean  concealed beneath the  Earth\\'s crust , residing 700 kilometers below the planet\\'s surface. The finding published in the 2014 scientific paper titled \\'Dehydration melting at the top of the lower mantle,\\' has reignited curiosity about the mysteries lurking within our planet. The oceanic reservoir, within a mineral known as  ringwoodite , surpasses the combined volume of all surface oceans thrice over, presenting a challenge to our understanding of Earth\\'s  water origins . Geophysicist  Steve Jacobsen , in the discovery team, sheds light on the unique properties of ringwoodite, describing it as a \"sponge\" with an unparalleled capacity to trap water deep within the Earth. Jacobsen said, \"I think we are finally seeing evidence for a whole-Earth water cycle, which may help explain the vast amount of liquid water on the surface of our habitable planet. Scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades.\" The breakthrough came after the analysis of  seismic activity , with seismometers detecting shockwaves reverberating beneath the Earth\\'s surface. By scrutinizing seismic data from over 500 earthquakes using a network of 2000 seismographs across the United States, researchers discerned a discernible slowing of seismic waves passing through hydrated rock, indicative of the presence of this expansive subterranean water reserve. \"The high water storage capacity of minerals in Earth\\'s mantle transition zone (410- to 660-kilometer depth) implies the possibility of a deep H2O reservoir, which could cause dehydration and melting of vertically flowing mantle. We examined the effects of downwelling from the transition zone into the lower mantle with high-pressure laboratory experiments, numerical modelling, and seismic P-to-S conversions,\" said the scientists. \"This is substantial evidence that water on Earth came from within,\" Jacobsen asserts, underscoring the paradigm-shifting implications of the discovery. Furthermore, the findings challenge conventional theories regarding the origins of Earth\\'s water, suggesting that it may have originated from within the planet rather than arriving via comet impacts, as previously proposed. This revelation not only captivates with its sheer magnitude but also offers a fresh perspective on Earth\\'s water cycle, proposing that water may seep from the planet\\'s core, gradually shaping the surface we inhabit. The implications extend beyond mere scientific curiosity, as Jacobsen highlights the significance of this reservoir in sustaining terrestrial ecosystems. Without this concealed water source, Earth\\'s surface would be devoid of the life-sustaining liquid, fundamentally altering the planet\\'s landscape as we know it.',\n",
       "  'Chennai: Having choked  River Cooum  to death by rampant discharge of untreated sewage and turning a blind eye to encroachments, Chennai is repeating all these mistakes to take life out of Cooum\\'s cousin â\\x80\\x93 River Kosasthaiyar â\\x80\\x93 which drains one-third of Chennai\\'s water. As of now it has still some life left and it is not too late for the govt and its agencies such as the  Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust  (CRRT) and the  Water Resources Department  (WRD) to step in and save it. The CRRT has failed to propose any worthwhile project for the river for two decades now, despite spending several hundred crores of rupees for Adyar and Cooum. \"Till Manali, the river is relatively free from heavy sewage and obstructions. Reviving the floodplains here, especially in areas like Nappalayan and Vallur, could significantly increase the river\\'s capacity. Downstream, a sewage interceptor with decentralised treatment plants could be built to tackle the pollution from Buckingham Canal,\" said T Kanthimathinathan, state disaster management coordinator. He added that nearly 50,000 encroachments need to be removed from the North B Canal. Experts also stress the need to focus on the estuary, where salt pans, mangroves, wetlands, and native species have all perished. Ennore\\'s wetland area has shrunk from 877 hectares in 1996 to just 277 hectares in 2022, according to submissions to the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Running to 136 km from Andhra Pradesh\\'s Ammapalli Dam,  Kosasthalaiyar  had a brush with disaster twice last year alone: an oil spill that polluted the estuary up to Manali and a severe flooding in Dec 2023, when a bund breach submerged Manali, affecting nearly 1 lakh residents. Yet, no restoration efforts have been made. The river\\'s drainage capacity below Manali stands at a meagre 20,000 cusecs. A spot visit by TOI revealed over 1,000 encroachments along Manali\\'s Sadayankuppam area, crowding the river\\'s floodplains, with no flood barrier walls in place. The encroachments have reduced the river\\'s carrying capacity from 1.1 lakh cusecs to just 60,000 cusecs beyond Manali. Last year\\'s breach occurred with only a 40,000 cusec release from Poondi, submerging roads to Ennore Port and halting truck traffic. The river\\'s surplus channel, stretching from the Thamaraipakkam Dam near Poondi to Cholavaram and Puzhal, is also neglected. There are no boundary walls at Madhavaram, Mathur, or along the 200-feet bypass road in Manali, and sewage continues to seep into the water. Downstream in the Ennore Estuary, high levels of pollution from fly ash and industrial chemicals have rendered the area lifeless. Dredging has not been carried out in over a decade at the estuary, with a half-submerged, rusted dredging machine near Mugathwarakuppam serving as a grim reminder. While some dredging has been done at Kattukuppam, the extracted mud piled high is ash-grey, underscoring the river\\'s heavy pollution. Further downstream, yellow and brown chemicals continue to pour into the water near the Buckingham Canal, where sewage and industrial waste from over a dozen factories â\\x80\\x94 many of them encroaching on the river\\'s floodplains â\\x80\\x94 are dumped unchecked. Despite its dire state at the estuary, experts believe Kosasthalaiyar has better restoration prospects than Chennai\\'s other rivers like the Adyar, Cooum and the Buckingham Canal, thanks to its concentrated pollution sources. Most of the contamination begins beneath the North Buckingham Canal, which drains 10,000 cusecs of floodwater from areas like Tondiarpet, Thiruvottiyur, and Kodungaiyur. Watersheds like Ambattur, Korattur, and Retteri lakes also feed into the river, alongside the Kodungaiyur and Otteri Nullah waterways. Santha Sheela Nair, a member of the river restoration expert committee, said hefty penalties collected by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board from polluting industries should be redirected towards restoration efforts, particularly targeting fly ash and chemical pollutants. \"The surrounding environment and livelihoods that depend on the river are in ruins. We need immediate action, and we will see changes,\" she urged. Joint Chief Engineer of the Water Resources Department, C Podupanithilagam, added that plans are in place to construct four reservoirs near Poondi to conserve more water. \"Work is underway. After the last floods, we recommended building revetment walls and have blocked sewage drains in Manali. A detailed project report on the downstream restoration, prepared by the NGT expert committee, will be released soon,\" he said. MSID:: 113433715 413 | ',\n",

       "  \"Our everyday routines shape the course of our lives. While some habits help us grow and thrive, others silently chip away at our well-being and might become dangerous to our health. Below are 12  daily habits  that, if left unchecked, can eventually destroy our lives. A not-so-active lifestyle can be damaging in more ways than one. Lack of movement weakens muscles, slows metabolism, and increases the risk of diseases like heart problems and diabetes. Small steps like daily walks or stretching can go a long way toward being a healthy human. Water is vital for almost every bodily function. Dehydration causes fatigue, headaches, and digestive issues. Over time, inadequate  hydration  can lead to kidney problems and affect your skinâ\\x80\\x99s appearance. Make it a habit to drink water regularly throughout the day. What you eat directly impacts your energy levels, mood, and long-term health. Junk food might sound amazing, but relying on those meals can result in nutrient deficiencies, weight gain, and serious illnesses like hypertension. A balanced diet full of vegetables, proteins, and healthy fats is essential for well-being. Taking care of your skin is more important than you think. Your skin is the bodyâ\\x80\\x99s largest organ and acts as a barrier against harmful elements. Skipping sunscreen, failing to moisturize, and not cleansing properly can lead to premature ageing, dryness, and even skin cancer. An irregular diet throws off the body's normal rhythm. Overindulging in food after midnight or going without meals might disrupt one's metabolism, lead to stomach problems, and potentially result in weight gain. Maintain consistent mealtimes. It will support the maintenance of your energy levels and healthy metabolism. Your mindset shapes how you experience life. Constant negativity breeds stress and anxiety, which takes a toll on mental and physical health. Itâ\\x80\\x99s essential to maintain positive thinking and practice gratitude. Bad  posture  doesnâ\\x80\\x99t just hurt your backâ\\x80\\x94it affects your mood, energy, and confidence. With time, it can lead to chronic pain, breathing issues, and even digestive problems. Everyone should make sure to sit and stand properly to prevent these long-term issues. There's a reason why breakfast is known as the most significant meal of the day. It starts your metabolism and gives you the energy you need for the day. The most crucial meal should never be skipped since it might cause low energy, poor focus, and overeating in the afternoon. Lack of sleep has dangerous consequences that no one would expect. It affects everything from cognitive function to emotional regulation. Over time, poor sleep habits can increase the risk of heart disease, obesity, and depression. Chronic stress is a silent killer. It elevates cortisol levels, weakens the immune system, and increases the risk of serious health issues like heart disease and depression. Adding stress-relief practices, such as meditation or physical exercise, can significantly improve mental and physical health. Blame-shifting impedes personal development. When you blame others all the time, you miss out on opportunities to grow as a person and fail to learn from your mistakes. Growth, prosperity, and improved relationships all depend on accepting responsibility. Learning maintains mental acuity and increases mental dexterity. You run the risk of stagnating when you stop learning new things. This may hinder your growth and make it harder for you to adjust to new challenges in both your personal and professional lives. Ongoing education keeps your mind active and stimulated.\",\n",

Kelgeri lake is now engulfed by invasive plant Eichornia Crassipes, known as  water hyacinth , which has spread to over 70% of the water area. Water hyacinth has formed dense colonies blocking sunlight into the water and causing considerable harm to the aquatic ecosystem and the water body itself. It is considered invasive because it grows rapidly and forms a thick layer over the water. These mats shade out the other aquatic plants. Eventually, these shaded plants die and decay. According to experts, the decaying process depletes the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. As oxygen levels decline, fish struggle to survive. Often the water below the hyacinth masses become devoid of life, the experts said. This invasive plant had descended on the Kelgeri lake a decade ago, but after constant efforts by environmentalists to save the lake, govt made the lake free from water hyacinth. However, the members of  Save Kelgeri campaign  said there is no effort from any of the govt agencies to protect this lake which is a hotspot for migratory birds.The volunteers are cleaning the lake twice or thrice in a year. Noted environmentalist late Professor JC Uttangi, who had seen Dharwad during its days of ecological and cultural glory, had said the large watershed area on the eastern side of the tank which was once the catchment area has been misused for constructing a colony of concrete houses that are obstructing the inflow of rainwater.  He had suggested that steps should be taken to chop down the hilly part and push the loose earth into water to provide a suitable â\\x80\\x98Littoral zone' for the aquatic plants to grow there. A â\\x80\\x98Limonitic zone' should be left open for the sunrays to penetrate to induce plants to grow and multiply there. The zone thus created will help in attracting many rare migratory birds into the tank along this edge, Uttangi has suggested.\",\n",
       "  'Numerous bird species worldwide look for soulmates, just like people do. These birds make permanent relationships with partners they can live out their whole lives with. A bird may, nevertheless, occasionally look for a new mate if it loses its current one. Their relationships are incredibly captivating and astounding due to their beauty and complexity. When it comes to establishing and preserving partnerships, these birds go above and beyond the minimum, frequently displaying behaviours that are intricate and captivating. Their extensive courtship rituals usually include beautiful and sophisticated calls, elaborate dances, and reciprocal expressions of caring and affection. They do these rituals in an attempt to locate and ensure their \"happily ever after. These remarkable birds demonstrate a profound commitment to their mates, showing how essential and fulfilling lifelong bonds can be. Their dedication to one another and the strength of their ties can be a moving reminder of the deep relationships found in the natural world, highlighting the unique ways in which these creatures find love and companionship. Discover the eight bird species who mate for life below. The black vulture, sometimes called the American black vulture, is found in Uruguay, Central Chile, Peru, and the Southeast United States. It can easily burrow into animal carcasses because of its short, hooked beak, and featherless, greyish-black head and neck. They take a wash following a meal, and the latitude determines when they breed. After engaging in courtship rituals, pairs form and lay their eggs in hollow logs or on the ground in forested settings. They might use metal objects, broken glass, or plastic in vibrant colours to adorn the surroundings. A fish-eating bird of prey, the Bald Eagle (sometimes called the Sea Eagle) is the largest nest-building eagle in the United States. It is America\\'s national symbol and a lifelong partner. Bald eagles court one another with complex cries and aerial displays, and they have a high percentage of mate fidelity. They make their nests and lay their eggs in the middle of February. Their young are flung from the nest in late June or early July. They are early breeders. A species of waterfowl native to Africa and Eurasia, the mute swan was brought to North America. It is white with a prominent bump on its orange beak. The females of the species lay four to ten eggs every 36 days, and the cygnets hatch between May and July. Because they can\\'t fly until they are 120â\\x80\\x93150 days old, young swans can only be found in the northernmost portion of their range. An incredible and uncommon species is the Whooping Crane, the tallest bird in North America. With the help of creative migration plans, wetland management techniques, and captive breeding, numbers have increased to roughly 600 now despite a drop in the 1940s. In late April or early May, the cranes lay their eggs in their nests on elevated wetlands. After around a year, the relationship between the parent and child ceases. Breeding populations spend the winter close to Rockport, Sunset Lake, Matagorda Island, Isla San Jose, and parts of the Lamar Peninsula on Texas\\' Gulf coast. Critically endangered, the California condor is the largest land bird in North America. Even though the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classed it as endangered, captive breeding programs have led to an increase in the species\\' population. The California condor has a wingspan of 9.5 feet and weighs 20 to 25 pounds. Adults have bare heads and necks and are black with a white triangle mark on them. California Condors are extremely rare birds that take six to eight years to attain sexual maturity. They are listed as endangered on Audubon\\'s Watchlist. After mating, the birds remain together for years, if not forever. Aerial displays guide the pairs to various nest locations during courtship, which is similar to looking for a possible place to call home. Naturally, the female gets the last choice on the birds\\' location. Commonly referred to as Atlantic puffins, these seabirds are endemic to the Atlantic Ocean and can be found in many different nations. The IUCN has classified them as vulnerable since they are the only native puffins found in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic puffin\\'s body and underparts are white, its cheek patches are pale grey, and its crown and back are black. It is an above-water swimmer that eats crabs, tiny fish, and zooplankton.  The species features orange legs and a large, brightly patterned red-and-black beak. The juvenile has a thinner bill and dark grey cheek patches, but the adult male and female seem the same. During the late spring breeding season, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas, where it nests in colonies atop cliffs and feeds on whole fish. They get their full flight at six weeks and leave the coast to swim. Rainbow-coloured macaws live together and prey on each other and their young. Scarlet macaws raise chicks after fledging and independence. Both male and female macaws have identical appearances. The cobalt-blue hyacinth macaw is the largest parrot, while the scarlet macaw is the best-known New World parrot. In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the monogamous Laysan Albatross is a common species of seabird. It can sail hundreds of miles a day on its remarkable six-foot span, and it couples for life. It can even glide over the broad ocean without a flap. They go through a grieving phase and a wooing dance to locate a new partner if they are lost.',\n",
       "  \"Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, are believed to have subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts that may harbour life. Recent   experiments indicate that if these oceans do support life, organic molecules like amino acids and nucleic acids might survive just below the ice surface despite intense radiation. This means that robotic landers exploring these moons might not need to dig very deep to detect these molecules. Alexander Pavlov of NASAâ\\x80\\x99s Goddard Space Flight Center notes that, for Europa, amino acids could be found up to eight inches (around 20 centimetres) below the surface in areas less impacted by meteorites. On Enceladus, amino acids may survive even closer to the surface, less than a tenth of an inch (a few millimetres) from it. While the harsh surface conditions of these moons, marked by high radiation from their host planets and cosmic events, render them uninhabitable, their subsurface oceans, warmed by tidal forces, could potentially support life if they contain necessary elements and compounds. Lead author Alexander Pavlov from NASAâ\\x80\\x99s Goddard Space Flight Center notes that for Europa, a sampling depth of about eight inches (20 centimetres) in relatively undisturbed areas could be sufficient to detect amino acids. In contrast, on Enceladus, these molecules could survive within just a few millimetres of the surface. The harsh surface conditions of these moons, characterised by high radiation from their planets' magnetic fields and cosmic events, make their icy exteriors inhospitable, but their subsurface oceans, heated by tidal forces, remain promising habitats for life. The research team conducted experiments to understand how amino acids might survive under these moons' conditions. By simulating Europa and Enceladus environments, they found that amino acids degrade more quickly when mixed with dust but are more stable when associated with microorganisms. This suggests that biological material might offer some protection against radiation, potentially preserving life-signalling molecules longer. These findings are crucial for designing future missions to Europa and Enceladus. Understanding where and how to sample is essential, as areas with less silica-rich dust might offer better chances for detecting preserved organic molecules. This research enhances our ability to search for life beyond Earth, providing valuable insights into where to look for signs of life in our solar system and beyond.\",\n",
       "  \"Have you ever wondered if there is life beyond  Earth  but havenâ\\x80\\x99t found one except our Universe? But actually, how to determine the search of life beyond your home Universe? According to the scientists, they suggest that there are three core ingredients which are determined to make life easier and livable. Additionally, life requires time to develop, so one should explore worlds where sufficient time has passed for life to potentially emerge. Jupiter's icy moon Europa may contain these crucial elements and is as old as Earth.  â\\x80\\x99 s  Europa Clipper  spacecraft is the one which helps to conduct an in-depth study of Europa and assess whether its subsurface ocean can support life. Understanding Europa's habitability will enhance the knowledge of the potential for life beyond our planet and guide our ongoing search. Liquid water is the primary ingredient for life, and Europa is abundant in it. Scientists believe that beneath Europaâ\\x80\\x99s icy crust lies a salty ocean containing twice as much water as all of Earthâ\\x80\\x99s oceans combined. Water is vital as it dissolves nutrients for organisms, facilitates chemical transport within cells, supports metabolic processes, and helps eliminate waste. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s strong evidence of a rocky seafloor beneath Europa's ocean, and hydrothermal activity could provide chemical nutrients that support living organisms. Europa appears as a half-sphere against the dark backdrop of space. Its surface is off-white with a slight bluish tint, featuring long, dark rusty lines. On the left side, these lines are tightly packed, while on the right side, they extend deeper and curve across the moonâ\\x80\\x99s surface. The image reveals more of the moon at the bottom, fading into darkness. This intriguing surface of Europa is showcased in a reprocessed colour image derived from photographs taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. The best evidence for an ocean beneath Europa was gathered by the Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Although Europa lacks its own magnetic field, the Galileo spacecraft detected a magnetic signature during 12 close flybys, likely caused by a global ocean of salty water beneath its surface. Europaâ\\x80\\x99s bright, icy exterior is unlike any found on Earth. It is the smoothest body in the solar system, with few mountains or deep basins. The surface is crisscrossed by ridges and grooves, and many features align with long, dark reddish streaks stretching over 600 miles (1,000 kilometres). Additionally, domes, pits, and clusters of icy blocks suggest warm ice may be rising from below. Images of Europa's surface reveal patterns of cracks and ridges indicative of a global ocean capable of producing large tides that deform the surface. The largest impact structures on Europa show concentric patterns, suggesting that impacts may have breached the icy shell into liquid water. Moreover, the moonâ\\x80\\x99s surface geology indicates that warm ice has likely risen from the ice-ocean interface. Models propose that Europa's icy shell is stretched and released by Jupiter's gravitational pull as the moon orbits the giant planet. This phenomenon, known as tidal flexing, generates internal heat within Europa, possibly maintaining the liquid ocean beneath its surface. In addition to water, life as we know it requires specific chemical elementsâ\\x80\\x94such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphurâ\\x80\\x94that are fundamental building blocks. These elements are abundant in the universe and constitute 98% of living matter on Earth, combining to form organic molecules essential for life. Scientists believe these elements were incorporated into Europa during its formation and were later augmented by organic materials from colliding asteroids and comets. While all life on Earth is composed of organic molecules, simply discovering these molecules does not necessarily indicate the presence of life. They can form through non-biological processes as well. However, finding such molecules on Europa would help determine whether the essential ingredients for life ever existed on the icy moon. Some of these vital chemical elements may currently reside within Europaâ\\x80\\x99s icy shell, while others could originate from its core and the weathering of the moon's rocky interior. Tidal flexing may facilitate the cycling of water and nutrients among the moon's rocky interior, icy shell, and ocean, creating a chemically rich aquatic environment conducive to life. The third vital ingredient for life is energy, which all living organisms require. On Earth, most energy comes from the Sun, with plants harnessing sunlight through photosynthesis to produce energy. This energy is then transferred to humans, animals, and other organisms when they consume plants. However, any potential life forms on Europa would likely depend on chemical reactions rather than photosynthesis, as they would exist beneath the ice, far from sunlight. Europa's surface is bombarded by radiation from Jupiter, making it inhospitable for surface life. Yet, this radiation might create energy sources for life within the ocean below. The radiation can break down water molecules (Hâ\\x82\\x82O) in Europa's thin atmosphere, allowing hydrogen to escape while much of the oxygen remains, potentially bonding with other elements. This reactive oxygen could facilitate chemical reactions that release energy, possibly supporting microbial life if it reaches the ocean. Additionally, Europaâ\\x80\\x99s ocean is likely in direct contact with warm rock at its seafloor. As Europa orbits Jupiter, its interior flexes, generating heat (similar to how bending a paperclip produces heat). The more the moon flexes, the more heat is generated, which can provide hydrogen and other chemicals to the ocean. If the rocky ocean floor is heated by tidal flexing, it could supply energy in the form of chemical nutrients through hydrothermal vents. This process is analogous to what occurs in hydrothermal vents on Earth, first discovered in 1977 on the Galapagos Rift in the Pacific Ocean. These discoveries revolutionised our understanding of life on Earth and are considered among the most significant breakthroughs in ocean science.\",\n",

Despite his immense influence and control over more than 30 companies operating in over 100 countries across six continents,   lived a modest life and never appeared on any list of billionaires. Ratan Tata joined the family firm after acquiring a B.S. in architecture from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, in 1962. He started his career by working on the shop floor, acquiring hands-on experience across different   businesses.  In 1971, he was appointed director-in-charge of National Radio and Electronics Co. (Nelco), one of the groupâ\\x80\\x99s companies. He became chairman of Tata Industries a decade later and in 1991, took over as the chairman of the Tata Group from his uncle, JRD, who had been in charge for more than half a century. Tata's ascension to the role of chairman coincided with India's economic liberalization in 1991. Under his leadership, the Tata Group, which had humble beginnings as a small textile and trading firm in 1868, transformed into a global powerhouse with diverse operations ranging from salt and steel to cars, software, power plants, and airlines. Ratan Tata led   for over two decades, during which the group pursued aggressive expansion. Also Read |  Under his leadership, Tata Sons acquired several high-profile companies, including Tetley Tea for $431.3 million in 2000, Daewoo Motors' truck-manufacturing operations for $102 million in 2004, Corus Group for $11.3 billion, and Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Company for $2.3 billion. In December 2012, he handed over control of Tata Sons to his then-deputy, Cyrus Mistry. However, disagreements arose over Mistry's leadership, leading to his removal in October 2016, marking the end of the first non-Tata family member's tenure as chairman. Ratan Tata was among the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on various projects, including the decision to discontinue the loss-making small car, Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata. Following Mistry's removal, Tata took on the role of interim chairman from October 2016 until January 2017, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed as the new chairman of the Tata Group.  Since then, Ratan Tata has been serving as the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons.

       "  'In the intertidal zones of the Indo-Pacific region, stretching from the eastern coast of Africa to the islands of the Pacific Ocean, lives a creature that defies the conventional boundaries of  aquatic life . These areas, characterized by their fluctuating tides and muddy shores, provide a challenging habitat for marine life. Yet, this fish has not only adapted to these conditions but has also developed the ability to move on land. This ability is particularly useful during low tide when the water recedes, leaving behind vast expanses of mudflats. The fish in question is the  mudskipper , a member of the Gobiidae family. Mudskippers are  amphibious fish  that can breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth and throat, a process known as cutaneous respiration. This adaptation allows them to survive out of water for extended periods. They are also equipped with strong pectoral fins that enable them to â\\x80\\x9cwalkâ\\x80\\x9d on land, making them one of the few fish capable of  terrestrial locomotion . Mudskippers are known for their distinctive behavior and physical characteristics. They can often be seen hopping or skipping across the mudflats, hence their name. Their bulging eyes, which can move independently, provide them with a wide field of vision, crucial for spotting predators and prey. These eyes are adapted to see both in and out of water, giving mudskippers a significant advantage in their dual habitats. The diet of mudskippers is as varied as their habitat. They feed on a range of organisms, including small fish, crustaceans, and insects. Their ability to hunt both in water and on land makes them versatile predators. Mudskippers are also known for their territorial behavior. Males often engage in elaborate displays to attract females and ward off rivals, including raising their dorsal fins and performing acrobatic jumps. Mudskippers have been the subject of numerous studies due to their unique  adaptations . Researchers have explored their  respiratory mechanisms , locomotion, and behavior to understand how these fish have evolved to thrive in such challenging environments. Studies have shown that mudskippers can survive out of water for up to two days, provided their skin remains moist. This remarkable endurance is a celebration of just how extraordinary nature is. The presence of mudskippers in various parts of the world highlights the incredible diversity of life on our planet. From the mangrove forests of Southeast Asia to the coastal regions of Africa, these fish have carved out a niche for themselves in some of the most dynamic and challenging ecosystems. Their ability to live both in water and on land serves as a reminder of the adaptability and resilience of nature.',\n",
       "  \"Plastic pollution  has become a significant global environmental issue, affecting ecosystems both on land and in the oceans. With millions of tons of plastic waste generated each year, much of it ends up in waterways, where it threatens  marine life  and pollutes natural habitats. Plastics take hundreds of years to break down, during which time they release toxic chemicals and fragments into harmful microplastics. These tiny particles are ingested by wildlife, contaminating food chains and ecosystems. As plastic production continues to grow, addressing this   through reduction, recycling, and responsible waste management is crucial for the health of our planet. While enjoying the soothing rhythm of waves on the beach, it's hard to face the fact that the ocean has turned into a massive pool of garbage, primarily filled with plastic. Sadly, millions of tons of debris are floating in the water, posing a serious risk to marine life. According to a study published in Science, the equivalent of 136 billion milk jugsâ\\x80\\x99 worth of trash enters the ocean every year. This relentless flood of waste entangles animals or ends up being ingested as it breaks into microplastics. Worse yet, plastic pollution in the ocean is nearly impossible to reverse, taking centuries to decompose and leaking harmful chemicals in the meantime. Shockingly, about 80% of this pollution originates from land, not from people dumping waste at sea.\",\n",

       "  'The black garden queen ( Lasius niger ) ant plays a crucial role in the survival and growth of her colony. As the sole reproducer, she is responsible for laying thousands of eggs throughout her life, ensuring the colonyâ\\x80\\x99s expansion. Distinguished by her large size and long lifespanâ\\x80\\x94up to 15 yearsâ\\x80\\x94the queen is a fascinating figure in the ant world. After a single mating flight, where she stores sperm for life, the queen devotes herself to producing offspring. Her diet, mostly supplied by worker ants, includes sugars, proteins, and, surprisingly, sometimes her own infected larvae. This cannibalistic behaviour is not only a defence mechanism against dangerous fungal infections but also helps recycle nutrients for future generations. Explore the queenâ\\x80\\x99s unique adaptations, including her physical traits, mating process, habitat, and remarkable behaviour. Queen ants are significantly larger than worker ants, making them easy to distinguish in a colony. The black garden ant queen can grow up to 15 millimetres, nearly twice the size of a typical worker. Queens initially have wings, which they shed after mating to establish a new colony. Their bodies are robust and specialised for reproduction, with a larger thorax and abdomen, housing the reproductive organs. Once settled, the queen remains in the nest for the rest of her life, focusing on laying eggs and producing thousands of offspring. The mating process of the black garden ant queen is known as the \"nuptial flight.\" On warm summer days, virgin queens and male ants leave their colonies en masse. Mating occurs mid-air during this flight. Afterward, the males die, and the queen lands to find a suitable location for her new colony. She sheds her wings and lays her first set of eggs, nurturing them until they hatch into worker ants. She stores sperm from the mating flight in a special organ and uses it to fertilise eggs throughout her life, eliminating the need for future mating. Queen ants live far longer than their worker counterparts. The black garden ant queen has a lifespan of up to 15 years, while worker ants typically only live for a few months. This extraordinary longevity allows the queen to produce thousands of offspring during her lifetime, ensuring the colonyâ\\x80\\x99s continuity. Queen ants primarily consume the same types of food as their workers. Their diet consists of sugars and proteins. In particular, they rely on:  A sugary liquid secreted by aphids, which ants \"farm\" by protecting aphids from predators. Insects: Worker ants bring back protein-rich food like insects to feed the queen and larvae. : In certain cases, as we\\'ll explore below, queens consume infected or dead larvae to recycle nutrients. The diet of a queen is essential to sustain her energy and enable her to produce a constant supply of eggs for the colony. Workers feed her throughout her life, ensuring she has the sustenance needed to maintain her reproductive role. Black garden ants thrive in temperate climates and are commonly found in gardens, grasslands, and urban areas. Queens establish colonies underground, often beneath stones or within decaying wood. The nest features a complex system of tunnels and chambers, where the queen resides in a deep, protected chamber. Once the colony is established, the queen rarely leaves the nest, entrusting the worker ants with gathering food and defending the colony. One of the more shocking behaviours observed in black  queen ants  is their tendency to eat their own larvae. But this act is not random or cruelâ\\x80\\x94it serves a critical purpose in the survival of the colony. Black garden ant larvae can sometimes become infected by a deadly fungus. If allowed to spread, the fungus can quickly infect the entire colony, killing all larvae and putting the queen at an 80% risk of death. To combat this, queens have evolved an extraordinary behaviour: cannibalism of infected larvae. When a larva becomes infected and cannot be saved, the queen kills and eats it. By doing so, she removes the threat to the rest of the colony while recycling the nutrients in the infected larva. These nutrients are then used to produce new, healthy offspring. Interestingly, queens do not become infected by consuming the larvae. Ants have a special venom gland that produces an acidic, antimicrobial substance. This venom is typically used to clean the nest or ward off predators. When consuming the infected larvae, queens groom themselves with this venom, likely using its antimicrobial properties to neutralise the fungus and protect themselves from infection. How does the queen know which larvae are infected? While this is not fully understood, researchers believe that infected larvae send chemical signals that trigger the queenâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour. Essentially, the larvae signal to the queen that they pose a danger to the colony, prompting her to consume them. Though this may seem gruesome, it is a highly evolved survival strategy. Since only queens reproduce, it is in the infected larvaâ\\x80\\x99s best genetic interest to sacrifice itself for the good of the colony and the queenâ\\x80\\x99s continued survival.',\n",

       "  'BENGALURU: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge\\'s family-run trust Sunday withdrew an approved request for a five-acre site within Bengaluru\\'s Aerospace Park for a proposed \" multi-skill development centre \", less than a fortnight after Karnataka CM  \\'s wife surrendered 14 plots amid an investigation into her land-swap deal with Mysore Urban Development Authority (Muda). \"We withdraw our proposal and request the board to cancel the allotment of the CA (civic amenities) site, per Clause 8 of the allotment letter,\" Rahul Kharge, one of the AICC chief\\'s sons and chairperson of Siddhartha Vihar Trust, said in a letter to the CEO of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. The site was allotted to the trust in March, prompting BJP to accuse the Congress govt of favouring the party president\\'s family. The trustees include Kharge, his wife Radhabai, elder son and minister Priyank Kharge, son-in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani, and Rahul. \"An educational institute cannot function effectively while facing mala fide, baseless, and politically motivated allegations... We do not wish to be drawn into controversies that will divert our attention and efforts from our primary objective of empowering the disempowered through education and social service,\" states the letter to the board. While the request for land had been approved, the site was still to be handed over to the trust, sources said. Defending his brother\\'s decision, Priyank said BJP tried to create \"a needless controversy\" and the family decided to step back rather than make an issue of it. The Kharge family had been stoutly defending the  land allotment  until recently. \"Rahul is a mild-mannered person who does not know how to counter these politically-motivated allegations, unlike us who are in public life. Siddhartha Vihar Trust is an educational, cultural, and charitable trust, and not a family or private entity,\" Priyank said, also taking a dig at Union home minister Amit Shah without naming him. \"The irony is that a person who cannot hold a bat can become the chairman of ICC or BCCI when BJP governs at the Centre, but a person (Rahul) who was conferred Agni Award by DRDO for excellence in self-reliance cannot build a skill development centre for the youth. So, he felt bad and decided to return the plot.\" BJP MP Lahar Singh Siroya wrote on social media that he felt vindicated by the Kharge family\\'s decision to return the land. \"When I raised this issue, I was threatened and abused by Kharge Jr and his cronies. Truth has prevailed,\" he said. The legislator suggested that since Siddaramaiah was on shaky ground, the return of land could even be a ploy to gain moral advantage. \"This may be a tactical move to seek the CM\\'s chair,\" he said BJP had called for a CBI investigation into the land allotment and petitioned the governor to dismiss Priyank from the state cabinet. When the controversy broke, CM Siddaramaiah had said, \"The allotment has been done in accordance with law. Their trust is eligible, so we have done it.\"',\n",

The restaurant staff had mistakenly mixed  caustic soda  in the fennel instead of sugar crystals (mishri), which caused severe burns and blisters in the woman's mouth. Acting on the complaint of the woman's brother, Piplani police on Monday registered a case against the errant hotel staff under section 125b (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of BNS and started investigations.

       "  'New Delhi: The capital is likely to get a  registered vehicle scrapping facility  (RVSF) to dismantle  overaged vehicles  in a scientific manner. At its recent meeting, the  Delhi Pollution Control Committee  categorised vehicle dismantling units as an orange category industry and said it would give consent to any private entity planning to operate such units. Officials said DPCC would authorise these units under various rules, including those on the management of hazardous waste, e-waste and plastic waste. At present, Delhi has no such scrapping units. To reduce vehicular pollution, the transport department is acting against  end-of-life vehicles  (ELVs) and sending the seized ones to RVSF in the neighbouring states. All petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles more than 10 years old are considered ELVs. The Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal have directed that registration and plying or deemed plying (parked in public space) of ELVs must be restricted. At its board meeting on Sept 27, DPCC observed, \"It was decided that in view of the age limits prescribed by the central govt for deregistering overaged vehicles, the number of vehicles to be scrapped in a scientific manner is increasing. The committee is of the view that if such facilities are not allowed in Delhi, illegal units will flourish in residential or non-conforming areas without any pollution control. As the activity is a service industry and also helps in the circular economy, consent may be granted to such units in approved industrial areas.\" RVSFs will be an orange category industry in Delhi. Based on the level of pollution involved, CPCB categorises industry in four colours â\\x80\\x94 red, orange, white and green, the last being least polluting. A DPCC official said since there is a plan to impound ELVs on a large scale this winter and given the jump in electric vehicles, the board decided to permit RVSFs in Delhi. \"Any private entity with access to land in an industrial area and capital can apply for consent to operate. Monitoring of air and water in the locality, especially for lead, will be undertaken by DPCC,\" said the official. Out of around 50 lakh ELVs in the city, 15,401 have been impounded so far in 2023 and 2024. The Commission for Air Quality Management informed the Supreme Court that although harvest stubble burning has reduced by half in the last three years, the large fleet of ELVs in these states accentuated the pollution. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, \"A well-organised scrappage infrastructure is an integral part of any fleet renewal policy and schemes to replace the older vehicles with new and e-vehicles. While this can reduce emissions from the older and polluting vehicles, it also helps recover material from the old fleet for reuse while preventing toxic contamination of the environment.\" Roychowdhury added that even as the scrappage infrastructure was expanded, efficient implementation had to ensure proper identification of all ELVs and that they reached RVSFs.

       "  'NEW DELHI:  , a controversial  Islamic evangelist  who is wanted in India on  terror-linked charges , landed in Islamabad on October 1 with   Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcoming the fugitive with wide arms and cosy hugs. Pakistan\\'s move to roll out the red carpet for Naik, who is there for a month-long visit, reek of mischief by the Sharif dispensation with the objective of opening up a new front of confrontation with India, which has virtually suspended its bilateral relations with Islamabad since the 2017 Uri and 2019 Pulwama terror attacks. India had carried out surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes in response to these terror attacks. The tension between India and Pakistan was palpable at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting last week, when external affairs minister S Jaishankar tore into Islamabad and warned that its \"cross-border terrorism policy can and will never succeed\". In a strong-worded reply to Pakistani  PM Shehbaz Sharif \\'s UNGA speech where he accused New Delhi of \"escalating tensions\" in Kashmir, Jaishankar warned that Islamabad\\'s \"actions will most certainly have consequences\". In the backdrop of such strained relations, Pakistan\\'s invitation to Zakir Naik has raised eyebrows, with some experts of the view that the fugitive\\'s visit is likely planned to fuel tension between the two nations. \"As a purveyor of hate speech, Zakir Naik has been banned from several countries including India. In giving him a royal reception, Pakistan is announcing that it is committed to embracing fundamentalism and is willing to set aside global opinion,\" social activist Pervez Hoodbhoy told Deutsche Welle. Amit Ranjan, a research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, said: \"As Pakistan is already facing violence related to social and political problems, giving space to Naik is nothing but an addition to the existing tensions.\" In Naik\\'s Pakistan visit, the only silver lining perhaps is that it provides New Delhi with a fresh opportunity to justify its claims that the neighbouring country continues to welcome and facilitate \"anti-India\" elements. \"There is a lesson in this invitation to Zakir Naik for those who advocate some diplomatic opening towards Pakistan, be it in sports, trade etc. Even reviving SAARC. The NC and PDP in Kashmir want India to talk to Pakistan. Shehbaz Sharifâ\\x80\\x99s speech at the UN was intemperate. Linked Kashmir to Palestine, talked of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s colonial settlement project in Kashmir and the Islamophobic Hindu supremacist agenda in India. Not a discourse intended to lower tensions with India. Shehbaz may get â\\x80\\x9cshabashâ\\x80\\x9d domestically but wonâ\\x80\\x99t improve Pakistan\\'s condition. Jaishankar gave a befitting reply in the UNGA to Sharif,\" Kanwal Sibal, former Indian foreign secretary, wrote on X. The controversial \"televangelist\" has been living in Malaysia since India\\'s anti-terror agency launched an investigation against him in 2016. Naik has been accused of promoting radical views similar to those of groups like the Islamic State and the Taliban, leading to bans on his speeches in India, Bangladesh, Canada and the United Kingdom. Naik has delivered over 1,500 public lectures since 1994, often asserting that Islam is the only true religion and criticising other faiths, as well as non-Wahhabi Islamic sects such as Shias, Sufis, and Barelvis. Naik is the founder of  Peace TV , a channel on comparative religion with a reported audience of over 100 million. It faces a ban in India in connection with alleged money laundering and hate speeches.  India also banned   in 2016, accusing it of encouraging followers to promote enmity and hatred. He fled India in July 2016 after Bangladeshi authorities claimed that one of the attackers on a cafe in Dhaka was inspired by Zakir Naik. The incident had left 22 people dead.  The   filed a charge sheet under Section 10 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, which has been replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The investigation revealed that Naik is the founding trustee and a member of an \"unlawful association\" â\\x80\\x93 IRF.',\n",
       "  'NEW DELHI:  \\'s top five judges, part of the  collegium  for transfer of HC judges and comprised the bench that had taken suo motu cognisance of  Justice V Srishananda \\'s unwarranted gratuitous remarks, had mulled transferring him outside Karnataka HC. Between September 20, when the bench of  CJI D Y Chandrachud , and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy took cognisance of  Justice Srishananda \\'s remarks, and Sept 25, when it admonished him prior to closing the case, the collegium comprising the same five judges had weighed the option of shifting the judge outside his parent HC. As the Karnataka HC Registrar General\\'s Sept 23 report, prepared in consultation with the HC chief justice N V Anjaria, referred to many past gratuitous and unwarranted observations of Justice Srishananda, the five-member Collegium deliberated on the option of shifting the judge to another HC to register SC\\'s strong objection to such remarks. Interestingly, a day after the SC took suo motu cognisance of Justice Srishananda\\'s June 6 gender insensitive remark and Aug 28 illogical reference to a Bengaluru locality as \\'part of Pakistan\\', the judge during the post-lunch session of court proceedings on Sept 21 said that his observations were unintentional and tendered apology in open court. The regret and promise to mend his ways crept into deliberations of the collegium, with some judges opposing transfer proposal on three grounds - Justice Srishananda has realised and regretted his mistake and this, along with the clarification that he did not wish to hurt any individual or community and apology tendered suo motu should be treated as mitigating factors.  They also cautioned that a transfer would become a precedent warranting transfer of all the outspoken judges as well as an incentive for the vigilantes who would be encouraged to pluck a seemingly controversial remark and wrench it from the context to set up a campaign against judges they don\\'t like. The reservations saw the Collegium failing to reach unanimity on whether to transfer Justice Srishananda leading them to settle suo motu  judicial proceedings  being taken to the logical conclusion on Sept 25. Taking a larger view even as they admonished the erring judge, the five-judge bench Wednesday laid down basic parameters for a judge\\'s conduct in a courtroom saying they, as well as all stakeholders including lawyers, should be mindful of what they say in a courtroom as live telecast and video conferencing facilities reach the judicial proceedings to a vast audience beyond the courtrooms. The bench closed the proceedings saying, \"Courts therefore have to be careful not to make comments which may be construed as misogynistic or prejudicial to certain sections of our society... We emphasise this point, as it is necessary for every stakeholder in the institution to understand that the values which must not die are the values enshrined in the Constitution (Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).\"',\n",
       "  'In the wake of the R G Kar incident, the  Bengali community  in Hyderabad has adapted women empowerment and safety, as their theme for this year\\'s   festivities. If some pandals are seeing women lead traditional rituals, others are using art to create awareness about the need for women\\'s protection. As a tribute to the victim of the heinous crime, a few have also decided to keep their celebrations low-key. Show of strength, unity To drive home a powerful message about the strength of women, the  Cyberabad Bangali Association  in Miyapur had about a 100 women members collectively blow the shankh (conch shell) to mark the onset of  , on Tuesday evening. Dressed in colourful attire, they gathered around the Durga idol â\\x80\\x93 united in their fight for women\\'s rights. \"The shankh dhwani is usually performed to welcome the goddess on Panchami (fifth day of the festival), but this year it also calls for justice for the RG Kar victim,\" said Swarnashree Saha Chatterjee, who led the women\\'s group that gathered to welcome the goddess. The association has also invited a team of women cooks from West Bengal for the festival this year, who will prepare bhog (prasadam) for thousands of devotees visiting the pandal over the next few days. \"It\\'s our way of upholding the notion of women\\'s empowerment through tradition,\" said Subhro Mukherjee, general secretary of the association. In the driver\\'s seat  While women have always played a key part in the Durga Puja organised by the Hyderabad Bangalee Samity, who have been hosting puja for the past 83 years â\\x80\\x94 the oldest in the city â\\x80\\x94 this year they have taken centre stage. And that\\'s also to symbolically reinstate their position in society, where women are often frontrunners. \"If we can run homes and offices, we can very well organise a Durga Puja,\" said Mousami Chowdhuri, first woman president of the association referring to the all-women leadership team that\\'s been set up, for the first time, to organise this event at NTR Gardens. Chowdhari also shared how the festival will see 50 women come together for the traditional dhunuchi dance, a devotional offering to the goddess. \"The dance, combined with the harmonious sound of the conch, represents the strength of women,\" said Joy Kumar Dutta, general secretary of the association adding how after the RG Kar incident, it\\'s imperative for all communities to rally for women\\'s safety. \"This Puja is not just a tribute to the RG Kar victim but to all women who have faced injustice in their lives,\" he said. Using art to depict challenges Amid the dhak-dhol (drums) and bhog, the walls of the pandal in Masab Tank, organised by the Bengalee Cultural Association, will ensure that every person walking in is educated about the gaps in women\\'s safety â\\x80\\x93 strongly reinforced post the R G Kar incident. \"Through posters and paintings made by women, we have decided to draw the attention of people to what happened in the Kolkata hospital and how women in other workplaces are facing similar challenges. We have shown the many battles that a woman has to wage and how sticking together, as a community, is the only way to fight societal evils,\" said Sujata Pan, convenor of the cultural committee. \"Durga Puja is more than just a religious festival for us; it\\'s about honouring the strength and wisdom of women,\" said Sanjay Bose from the association. He highlighted their â\\x80\\x98Nari Shakti\\' team, which provides essential support to underprivileged families, reinforcing their commitment to women\\'s empowerment. To continue fight for justice Since Aug, a large group of members from the Utsav Cultural Association in Gachibowli â\\x80\\x93 many of them IT professionals â\\x80\\x93 have led rallies demanding justice for the R G Kar victim and better security for women in workplaces. To keep their fight going, members of this group have decided to stick to low-key festivities this year so that those in places of authority do not think that the people\\'s movement across India has died out. \"We will follow all traditions and rituals through the five-days of Durga Puja, but in the middle of it all, we cannot forget what happened to one of our sisters in Kolkata. We initiated the protest, and we cannot abandon it until justice is achieved. The Goddess herself symbolises feminine power, making this the perfect time to raise our voice for justice. We will not find peace until that is achieved,\" said Sayantani Chatterjee, a member of the association. \"We do not want to celebrate extravagantly while this injustice remains unaddressed,\" added Indranil Aditya, joint secretary of the association.',\n",

We have already donated his eyes to  LV Prasad Eye Institute  (in Hyderabad), and his body will also be donated tomorrow,\" Saibaba\\'s daughter Manjeera told news agency PTI. Roughly seven months after he was cleared of having links with  Maoists , the ex-DU passed away on Saturday night due to post-surgery complications at  Nizamâ\\x80\\x99s Institute of Medical Sciences  hospital. Saibaba was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and underwent surgery two weeks ago, but later experienced complications.  Following his release from jail, he received medical care in Delhi for several health issues that arose due to his extended imprisonment. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I went to prison, I had no ailment other than my disability. Now, my heart is 55% functional... liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected,â\\x80\\x9d he had said at the time of his release from jail. His daughter recalled that the last time she spoke with her father was the day before evening and he told that it was going to be fine. \"None of us, not even he could have anticipated something like this would have happened.\" \\'We were hoping for another miracle to happen, it did not happen this time. His body had borne too much all these years,\" Manjeera told news agency PTI. Meanwhile, GN Saibaba\\'s brother told news agency ANI: \"NIMS doctors declared his death at 8:36 pm today because of many ailments. He had his gallbladder surgery in NIMS. The surgery was successful and he was able to talk to us able to move freely in the wheelchair he was very good for the last five days after surgery. But all of a sudden we don\\'t know what happened a pus formed inside and he started getting fever and severe abdominal pain for five days doctors did some medical medication but still either pain or temperature control. They found that a pus inside and then they did a procedure to remove the pus two days back...But later the next day they found that there was internal bleeding in the stomach and they made a procedure to stop it. But after stopping also he could not recover\". His friends and colleagues remembered Saibaba, whom they fondly reffered Sai, as a fighter.  â\\x80\\x9cHe got polio when he was five years old. That is when his struggle began and never ended,â\\x80\\x9d said Nandita Narain, former St Stephenâ\\x80\\x99s College professor.  â\\x80\\x9cI learnt about him when I was elected member of DUâ\\x80\\x99s Executive Council from 1996 to 2000. He once came to my house with his wife when he didnâ\\x80\\x99t have a wheelchair. He was just dragging himself, but had a big smile on his face.â\\x80\\x9d Narain added, â\\x80\\x9cThose 10 years in jail left him completely broken. He was thrown around and dragged when he got arrested. He had 21 ailments when we last counted. They did this to him because he spoke up on issues that nobody spoke about. They wanted to crush his voice. He still had the determination. In the prison, he used to teach inmates.â\\x80\\x9d She also remembered, â\\x80\\x9cWhen he came out of prison, he made pickles with lemons from Medak himself and gave them to me. He said it would be good for my health.â\\x80\\x9d  Saibaba had a strong presence and he drove things, recalled Karen Gabriel, vice principal of St Stephenâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x9cWe had common issues that we were fighting like land grabbing, illegal mining, etc., and we became good friendsâ\\x80\\x9d.  Gabriel said Saibaba hadnâ\\x80\\x99t ever been fragile. â\\x80\\x9cThen we saw how fragile they made him in prison. He was barely able to lift his right arm when left jail. His organs were damaged,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI spoke to his family and they are in a shambles.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSaibaba played a key role in several peopleâ\\x80\\x99s movements like pro-reservation protests in 1989-90, democratic rights of prisoners in 1993, movement to support the rights of Adivasis, and several others. Though he hailed from Andhra Pradesh, he led a huge public meeting in support for the formation of separate Telangana in 1997,â\\x80\\x9d said K Ravi Chander, convener for Forum Against Repression. Meanwhile, there were political reactions too, with Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin hailing the ex-DU professor as a \"tireless advocate of the oppressed\".  \"Prof. G.N.

My sincere condolences to his family and loved ones during this difficult time,\" Stalin wrote on X.

       "  'KOLKATA:  Calcutta high court  on Friday declined to impose any  prohibitory order  on the   called by the  Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj  on Aug 27. A division bench of Justice Harish Tandon and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya passed the order while taking note of the  apex court order  on  peaceful protests  from any quarter of the civil society. At the same time, the division bench took note of  public peace , safety, convenience of the public at large and directed the respondents (the organisers of the programme) to disclose their stand within three days from date.  The petitioner, a high court lawyer and resident of  Howrah , had moved the court praying for reasonable restrictions on the rally on the ground that the proposed rally route connected National Highway 117 and was dotted with a number schools, hospitals, colleges and public institutions. Counsel for the petitioner Jaydip Kar urged for reasonable restrictions, not prohibition, on the rally in view of the violence and bloodshed in the same area last year. Kar also pointed out that the UGC-NET examination was scheduled across the country on that date. \"The right to protest is subject to reasonable restrictions,\" Kar submitted. Kar pleaded for a balance between the right to protest and the right of others.  Justice Tandon said that maintaining  public order  was the state\\'s prerogative. \"They have to take adequate measures. That is their duty,\" Justice Tandon said. Advocate general Kishore Datta in his virtual appearance submitted that the state can\\'t exercise its regulatory powers because the organisers of the rally didn\\'t make an application to the police enabling the law enforcing authority to use regulatory powers. Datta pointed out that the call was given through social media. \"The challenge today is that an unknown group of people has given a call for the Nabanna march when the place is under prohibitory orders,\" the advocate general said. He submitted that Nabanna is a \"public premise\" under the law and argued no one can claim to protest at a public premise as a matter of right.

       "  'NEW DELHI: A protest march was organised by the  Bengal Junior Doctors\\' Front  in Kolkata on Wednesday, demanding justice for a medic who was raped and murdered at the state-run  RG Kar Medical College and Hospital  in August. The march, which began at College Street and ended in Esplanade area, was joined by thousands of junior doctors and people from various walks of life. The protesters vowed to continue their agitation until the government takes decisive action. One of the protesters, identifying herself as a colleague of the deceased, said, \"We are not in a \\'Puja\\' or \\'Utsav\\' mood, and we will continue protesting on the streets till our sister gets justice. We have chosen this day of Mahalaya to send out this message.\" The protesters carried placards and national flags, raising slogans and asserting their determination to fight for justice. The march coincided with the ongoing \\'cease-work\\' stir by doctors in hospitals, protesting against the heinous crime. As the rally concluded at Esplanade, leaders of the Bengal Junior Doctors\\' Front pledged to continue their agitation until the government takes definitive action. An agitating junior doctor addressed the crowd, saying, \"We will not give up. This is about our safety, our dignity, and  justice for Abhaya . The government cannot expect us to remain silent while they do nothing.\" The rally attracted a diverse mix of participants, including doctors, nurses, medical students, and concerned citizens. Later, the protesters gathered on the banks of Ganga, lighting 1,000 diyas as a symbolic act in their fight for justice. Despite the festive atmosphere in the city due to the upcoming Durga Puja, the protesters maintained that their movement for justice took precedence over celebrations. Aniket Mahato, one of the agitating junior doctors, addressed the crowd at Esplanade, saying, \"Today is the 52nd day of our protest, and we are still facing attacks. There is no positive response from the state government toward meeting our safety and security demands.\" The junior doctors in West Bengal have resumed their \\'cease work\\' protest, claiming that the state government has failed to fulfill the promises made in mid-September. The doctors had partially resumed services after a 42-day strike but went back to the protest on Tuesday, citing the lack of implementation of key demands such as enhanced safety measures for medical staff. The Bengal Junior Doctors\\' Front has raised several demands, including the installation of CCTV cameras on hospital premises, round-the-clock security for healthcare workers, and stricter protocols to prevent incidents of violence against medical professionals. The doctors have also highlighted the culture of fear and intimidation within state-run hospitals, alleging that the administration has not provided a safe working environment. \"We joined our profession to serve the people, but how can we do so when we constantly live in fear? We don\\'t feel safe in the very places where we are supposed to save lives,\" said another junior doctor. Despite initial promises by the  West Bengal government  to address the doctors\\' concerns, the agitating doctors claim that there has been little follow-up action. The government\\'s attempts to broker peace with the doctors have so far been unsuccessful, with state officials urging the medics to return to work and suggesting that police investigations into the alleged murder of the junior doctor are ongoing. The junior doctors\\' protest has received widespread support from Kolkata\\'s general public, with many residents expressing solidarity with the movement. \"This is not just about doctors. This is about justice, about safety in our institutions, and about holding those in power accountable,\" said Swati Mukherjee, a homemaker who joined the rally along with her family. As tensions between the junior doctors and the state government intensify, the protest movement is expected to continue in the coming weeks, even as Kolkata prepares for its biggest festival of the year.  In a symbolic gesture, a statue named \\'Abhaya\\' was unveiled on RG Kar Hospital premises, which the agitating doctors claim represents the horrific incident that occurred on August 9 and the ongoing protests demanding justice. \"This statue is not of the victim, but a symbol of pain, torture she went through and the ongoing protests,\" a junior doctor of the hospital told reporters.',\n",
       "  'Bengaluru: Emphasising the need for  good institutions  to evolve, Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud said Sunday that the changes, however, should take place incrementally, failing which there would be the risk of destabilising what has been achieved over the past 75 years. Speaking at the 32nd annual convocation of  National Law School of India University  (NLSIU), at which 1079 students graduated, the CJI urged young lawyers to approach life with patience.  He cited Walter McMillian\\'s case in the US, where lawyer Stevenson spent years gathering evidence and, after six years, ensured McMillan\\'s release from death row in 1993.  \"Judges sometimes ask peculiar questions. I asked one such peculiar question when I was dealing with a review petition against an order confirming a death penalty. As you know, review petitions and death penalty cases are now heard in open court in the Supreme Court. I was quite impertinent in asking a question to the lawyer â\\x80\\x94 How long would you take? The lawyer responded, â\\x80\\x98if you have the patience, I will persuade you that not only is this a case for commutation of the sentence of death to life, but this is the case for a clean acquittal\\'.\" \"We gave that little bit of patience that afternoon, but it resulted in the acquittal of the accused,\" he said, to thunderous applause from young lawyers. The university awarded 48 gold medals to graduates during the convocation. The CJI, who is also the chancellor of NLSIU, said, \"College life not only teaches you core subjects of law and social science, but it also teaches you how to navigate your life... There\\'s one thing which is liberating, which a  law degree  does to you, which is that you leave that baggage at the threshold. And as you emerge, there is only one steady stream of values that must guide you from now, and those are the values of the Constitution.\" He urged the graduates to build a strong support network â\\x80\\x94 spend time with family and friends. \"There are times when I return home in the evening and I feel terribly alone and lonesome. But that sense of loneliness is balanced by the friendship of close friends, the love of family, of people who have mentored me, but most importantly, of people I am mentoring,\" he said, reminding them to render mentorship and guidance, just as they ask for help. He referred to a question asked a few days ago on how he takes decisions in this vortex of conflicts that comes to him in the Supreme Court. He recalled his reply: \"I said, once you\\'ve heard fairly, different viewpoints, then you retreat into yourself, and that\\'s when you shut out the cacophony of voices, then you appeal to something within, which is guided by the eternal values which we are intended to espouse â\\x80\\x94 liberty, dignity, and autonomy of the individual. The decisions you face, particularly the difficult ones, will require strength.\" He urged students to remember to pause and listen to their inner voice in moments of uncertainty when facing tough choices and take pride in one\\'s individuality. \"Your unique perspectives, shaped by your individual experiences, are invaluable. Don\\'t be afraid to bring them to the table, even when - especially when - they differ from the mainstream view. As you move forward in your careers, strive to be not just great minds, but also compassionate human beings,\" he told young lawyers.',\n",
       "  \"A recent poll conducted by the  Manhattan Institute  has revealed that  Jewish support  for the Democratic Party is at its lowest since the Reagan era, as Vice President   struggles to rally voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The survey, carried out between October 5 and 9, included a representative sample of 658 Jewish registered voters across the United States and highlighted growing concerns within the Jewish community regarding  antisemitism , Israel, and other policy issues. While Jewish voters remain predominantly aligned with the Democratic Party, their support is weakening. According to the Manhattan Institute poll, Harris is poised to perform worse among Jewish voters than any Democratic candidate since the 1980s. If the election were held today, the poll indicates that Harris would secure 67% of the Jewish vote, while former President   would receive 31%. This shift in support marks a significant departure from past election cycles. Historically, Jewish voters have shown strong support for Democratic candidates. In 1992, Bill Clinton secured 80% of the Jewish vote over George Bush Sr. However, support has gradually declined; Joe Biden received 68% of the Jewish vote in 2020, while Hillary Clinton won 71% in 2016. The trend of declining Jewish support for  Democrats  has accelerated since the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas. The pollâ\\x80\\x99s findings reveal that Jewish voters are increasingly uneasy about the Democratic Partyâ\\x80\\x99s stance on antisemitism. A significant 62% of respondents expressed concern over growing antisemitism within the party. Jesse Arm, Chief of Staff at the Manhattan Institute, noted, â\\x80\\x9cMany are likely uncomfortable with the Democratic Partyâ\\x80\\x99s tolerance of voices that criticize Israel in extreme terms, such as labeling the country â\\x80\\x98genocidal.â\\x80\\x99 This is evidenced by the fact that Jews are almost universally supportive of Israelâ\\x80\\x94a mere 5% of Jewish voters say they are not supporters of the Jewish state.â\\x80\\x9d The survey also found that Jewish voters are largely united in their support for Israel, with 86% expressing strong support for the Jewish state. â\\x80\\x9cSecurity, Israel, and antisemitismâ\\x80\\x9d were identified as Harrisâ\\x80\\x99s weakest issues relative to Trump among Jewish voters, indicating that these topics are pivotal in shaping Jewish voter preferences ahead of the election. Despite the overall decline in support for the Democratic Party, Jewish voters still align with Democrats on specific issues, such as abortion. A majority of Jewish Republicans also described themselves as pro-choice. In contrast, on immigration, crime, and fiscal matters, Jewish votersâ\\x80\\x99 views diverge, showing a mix of moderate and conservative positions. For instance, Jewish voters want increased vetting in the immigration process but are generally supportive of expanding high-skilled immigration. On crime, Jewish voters are more in line with Republican views, feeling that the nationâ\\x80\\x99s criminal justice system is not tough enough. They are also fiscally moderate, expressing concern over government spending while supporting higher taxes on middle- to upper-income brackets. The poll also shed light on Jewish voters' perspectives on free speech and university policies. Jewish respondents expressed support for laws banning people from covering their faces with the intent to conceal their identity in public places, a stance that gained traction following incidents of anti-Israel activists intimidating Jewish students on college campuses and targeting Jewish community members across the US. Additionally, Jewish voters expressed a desire for universities to be held accountable, supporting taxation on university endowments. They also showed a preference for a color-blind society over race-conscious policies, revealing divided opinions on affirmative action and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The poll highlighted denominational differences within the Jewish community regarding support for Harris and Trump. Harrisâ\\x80\\x99s strongest backing came from Reform and unaffiliated or nondenominational Jews, who are traditionally more aligned with progressive causes. However, her support was notably weaker among Conservative Jewish voters, and Orthodox Jewish voters showed a preference for Trump, leading him by 18 points. Religious observance also played a role in voter preferences. Among Jewish voters who attend religious services weekly, Harris led Trump by a narrow margin of 51% to 46%. In contrast, those who never attend services overwhelmingly supported Harris, with a 75% to 24% lead over Trump.\",\n",
       "  'October 2nd holds immense significance for India as it commemorates the birth anniversary of  , the Father of the Nation. This day not only honours his contributions to India\\'s independence but also serves as a reminder of his enduring message of peace,  non-violence , and  social justice . Gandhi\\'s life and teachings have inspired countless individuals across the globe, transcending cultural and national boundaries. As the country celebrates Gandhi\\'s 155th birthday, it\\'s important to reflect on the profound impact he has had on various international figures. As India honours Gandhi on this significant day, the enduring legacy of his teachings continues to inspire individuals around the world. From technology leaders and musicians to political figures and actors, Gandhi\\'s philosophy of non-violence and justice resonates deeply, encouraging a collective commitment to peaceful change and social equity. His life serves as a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have in shaping the world, urging all of us to reflect on our own roles in fostering a more just and compassionate society. \\' connection to Gandhi began during a pivotal moment in his life. At just 19, Jobs travelled to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. This journey deeply influenced his worldview and leadership style. Upon returning to the United States, he expressed a strong admiration for Gandhi, considering him a model for what he wanted to achieve. Jobs famously said, \"He changed the world,\" highlighting Gandhi\\'s ability to inspire change through peaceful means. During a particularly challenging period at Apple, Jobs adopted the round wire-rimmed glasses famously worn by Gandhi, symbolising his reverence for the leader. In a 1999 interview, he named Gandhi as his Person of the Century, underscoring the significance of moral action in effecting social change. John Lennonâ\\x80\\x99s relationship with Gandhi was both personal and philosophical. He often reflected on the paradox faced by nonviolent leaders like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., who were tragically assassinated despite their commitment to peace. In the early drafts of the iconic Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover, Lennon included Gandhi among a collage of influential figures but ultimately replaced him with a palm leaf due to concerns over potential backlash. Lennon\\'s commitment to non-violence was evident in his activism against the Vietnam War, where he and Yoko Ono advocated for peace. His song \"Mind Games\" explicitly references Gandhi, illustrating the deep resonance of Gandhi\\'s principles in Lennon\\'s pursuit of social justice. The Dalai Lama has frequently spoken about Gandhi\\'s profound impact on his life and philosophy. During his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 1989, he paid tribute to Gandhi as a pioneering figure of non-violent resistance. Reflecting on Gandhiâ\\x80\\x99s legacy, the Dalai Lama has described him as the most influential person of the 20th century, particularly for his promotion of ahimsa (non-violence). The Dalai Lama believes that Gandhiâ\\x80\\x99s approach to achieving social and political change through non-violent means remains relevant today, inspiring individuals and movements worldwide.  has openly acknowledged the influence Gandhi has had on his life and political philosophy. In his memoir, he writes about how Gandhiâ\\x80\\x99s teachings shaped his understanding of leadership and justice, alongside figures like Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. During a visit to Gandhi\\'s residence in Mumbai, Obama expressed a desire to engage with Gandhi\\'s legacy, reflecting on the strength and creativity that Gandhi demonstrated in his struggles. Keeping a framed picture of Gandhi in his Senate office served as a constant reminder of the ideals of peace and perseverance that Gandhi stood for. Matt Damon attributes much of his commitment to humanitarian efforts to the inspiration he drew from Gandhiâ\\x80\\x99s teachings. He recalls that as a child, his mother kept a magnet on their refrigerator featuring a quote from Gandhi: \"No matter how insignificant what you do may seem, it is important that you do it.\" This early exposure to Gandhi\\'s philosophy instilled in him the importance of contributing positively to society, shaping his values and actions as an adult. Damonâ\\x80\\x99s dedication to social causes reflects the powerful influence that Gandhi\\'s words can have across generations.',\n",
       "  'HYDERABAD: Barely seven months after he was cleared of having links with  Maoists  by Bombay HC, which called the trial court proceedings a â\\x80\\x9cfailure of justiceâ\\x80\\x9d, former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at  Nizamâ\\x80\\x99s Institute of Medical Sciences  hospital. Doctors said he was admitted for removal of gallstones and died of post-surgery complications. The 57-year-old wheelchair-bound teacher and activist spent over seven years in jail after he was first arrested in May 2014. He was acquitted in March by the HC. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I went to prison, I had no ailm ent other than my disability. Now, my heart is 55% functional... liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected,â\\x80\\x9d heâ\\x80\\x99d said on his release. Acquitting him, the Nagpur bench of  Bombay High Court  had called the trial court proceedings a â\\x80\\x9cfailure of justiceâ\\x80\\x9d, and pointed out the lack of sanction under  UAPA  to prosecute him. It also said the prosecution had failed to establish the seizure of incriminating material from his house. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I went to prison, I had no ailments other than my disability. Now, my heart i s only 55% functional, and I am facing muscular complications. My liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected. My right hand is partially functional. My doctor says I need multiple surgeries,â\\x80\\x9d he had told reporters after his release on March 6. â\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t go to the prison hospital. There was not a single access ramp for the disabled in the jail, no separate toilets. I was always physically lifted for my toilet and bath needs. How can one live like that?â\\x80\\x9d he had said. Saibaba was kept in the â\\x80\\x98anda cellâ\\x80\\x99 (solitary confinement) at  Nagpur central jail , which, he said, affected him mentally as well. Probe agencies came across Saibabaâ\\x80\\x99s name allegedly after the arrest of a JNU student who claimed to have been acting as a courier between the professor and Maoists holed up in Abujhmarh forests in Chhattisgarh. Saibaba was arrested by Maharashtra police for allegedly conspiring to wage war against the nation besides violations under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). A Gadchiroli court convicted him of the charges and awarded him life imprisonment in 2017. After a prolonged legal battle, he was acquitted by the high court. â\\x80\\x9cSaibaba played a key role in several peopleâ\\x80\\x99s movements like pro-reservation protests in 1989-90, democratic rights of prisoners in 1993, movement to support the rights of Adivasis, and several others. Though he hailed from Andhra Pradesh, he led a huge public meeting in support for the formation of separate Telangana in 1997,â\\x80\\x9d said K Ravi Chander, convener for Forum Against Repression, who knew Saibaba for 35 years. Saibaba was born in Anakapalli in AP. After graduating, he p ursued his postgraduation in University of Hyderabad. He was working as an English professor in Delhi University until he was arrested. After he was released from jail, he underwent medical treatment in Delhi for various health complications â\\x80\\x94 a fallout of his prolonged stay in jail. He is survived by his wife and daughter. His friends and colleaguesremembered Saibaba, whom they fondly called Sai, as a fighter. â\\x80\\x9cHe got polio when he was five years old. That is when his struggle began and never ended,â\\x80\\x9d said Nandita Narain, former St Stephenâ\\x80\\x99s College professor. â\\x80\\x9cI learnt about him when I was elected member of DUâ\\x80\\x99s Executive Council from 1996 to 2000. He once came to my house with his wife when he didnâ\\x80\\x99t have a wheelchair. He was just dragging himself, but had a big smile on his face.â\\x80\\x9d Narain added, â\\x80\\x9cThose 10 years in jail left him completely broken. He was thrown around and dragged when he got arrested. He had 21 ailments when we last counted. They did this to him because he spoke up on issues that nobody spoke about. They wanted to crush his voice. He still had the determination. In the prison, he used to teach inmates.â\\x80\\x9d She also remembered, â\\x80\\x9cWhen he came out of prison, he made pickles with lemons from Medak himself and gave them to me. He said it would be good for my health.â\\x80\\x9d Saibaba had a strong presence and he drove things, recalled Karen Gabriel, viceprincipal of St Stephenâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x9cWe had common issues that we were fighting like land grabbing, illegal mining, etc., and we became good friendsâ\\x80\\x9d. Gabriel said Saibaba hadnâ\\x80\\x99t ever been fragile. â\\x80\\x9cThen we saw how fragile they made him in prison. He was barely able to lift his right arm when left jail. His organs were damaged,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI spoke to his family and they are in a shambles.â\\x80\\x9d (With inputs from Meghna Dhulia)',\n",

       "  'Comedian  Samay Raina  who rose to fame after winning  Comicstaan 2  and is currently a judge on  India\\'s Got Latent , a talent show for comedians on YouTube, has come under fire for making derogatory comments against people with  disabilities  on the show during a stand-up performance, by using offensive words like \\'lang de\\', \\'apahij\\', \\'goonga\\', \\'behra\\' and \\'hakla\\' (terms for people with physical disabilities and speech disorders). Originally, this issue was pointed out by Dr Satyendra Singh on \\'X\\', (formerly known as Twitter). Highlighting that the 5 jury members were laughing at the jokes being fired at the disabled people.  In his post, Dr Singh mentioned \"All 5 judges gave standing ovation to Santosh Patra for mocking people w/ disabilities on #IndiasGotLatent at @indiehabitat. I watched in disbelief as the judges laughed hysterically, clapping & finding this blatant #DisabilityAbuse entertaining.\" Dr Satyendra also took the step to send legal notice for Defamation and Disability Discrimination to the jury members, which included Samay Raina, Nishant Tanwar, Vipul Goyal, Sonali Thakker and Santosh Patra of the show. Dr Satyendra Singh practices in Delhi at the Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital and the University College of Medical Sciences. Singh, a physiologist by profession, was diagnosed with poliomyelitis when he was nine months old. He is also the founder and Organizational Head of â\\x80\\x98Doctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change,â\\x80\\x99 a national collective of health professionals with disabilities. After this, posting a clip from the show, triple amputee  Tinkesh Kaushik  in his LinkedIn post expressed disappointment over Raina\\'s indiscriminate use of the terms that mocked disabled people. \"If you laughed along, think again. It\\'s not humor. It\\'s hate,\" a part of his post read. The clip shows Raina asking a participant things like - \\'where did you learn to stammer, and \\'how would you talk to a langde\\'. When the participant mocks a physically disabled person by imitating their walk, Raina responds with -   (sometimes, success is climbed on one leg). Flagging the incident, activist and triple amputee Tinkesh Kaushik, took to social media highlighting Raina\\'s use of offensive language. \"Samay Raina by imitating stammering, throwing around words like langde, apahij, goonga, behra, hakla-without a shred of shame you think you are cool? And this dehumanising is laughed at by the audience? How empty your lives must be. Any one of you can become langde, apahij, goonga, behra, andha at any point in your lives. It takes one accident. Or you may have a child who is disabled later in life. Think about it. Will you laugh then?\" he wrote. Tagging Dr. Virendra Kumar, Minister for  Social Justice  & Empowerment, in his post, Kaushik, demanded   against Raina. \"How is this acceptable in 2024? The section 92(a) of the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities  Act 2016 states whoever intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a person with disability in any place within public view shall be punishable with imprisonment. If you laughed along, think again. It\\'s not humor. It\\'s hate,\" wrote Kaushik, questioning the audience present at the show, who laughed along when Raina made these comments during the performance of the participant. Tinkesh Kaushik became the world\\'s first triple amputee to reach the Mount Everest Base Camp located 17,598 feet above sea level, according to a report. He achieved the feat on May 11 and said it was possible due to his mental strength. Kaushik had lost both his limbs below the knees and a hand following an electrocution accident in Haryana when he was 9 years old. He uses prosthetic limbs and works as a fitness coach. The post elicited a strong response from netizens who slammed the comedian\\'s behavior and demanded a boycott of such shows. Having fun at other\\'s expanse, specially when someone had no control over his condition, is not funny. And this is not the first time Samay Raina has been criticized for his insensitive jokes. Some are surprised how the members of audiences enjoyed the derogatory remarks made against people with disability, and expressed their horror. \"Very indecent and insulting behaviour, shows their upbringing and culture. Boycott shows by these so called comedians,\" wrote a social media user. \"And then they try to defend their shameless acts with \"take  comedy  as comedy, it\\'s just dark humour\". Ask them if they would feel the same when a foreigner makes racist jokes about indians\\' skin colour. Would they still ignore it in the name of comedy? Worst part is they might never apologize bcz majority \\'non-disabled\\' people will continue to overlook it. I wish they get some education!\" wrote another one. \"This is disgraceful, disgusting.. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know howâ\\x80\\x99s their conscience allow these acts,\" remarked a furious user. \"All the people sitting and enjoying here are having MENTAL DISABILITIES.. you canâ\\x80\\x99t help it,\" read another comment. \"How is it that people with disabilities and non traditional sexual orientations are abused with full immunity, but say one thing about religion, and people will send threats to your family? This outrage clearly won\\'t help since they\\'ve their heads inside their rear ends to take a gander around. It\\'s almost exhaustive everyday to get hate and then force oneself to be the bigger man, while we\\'re censored when it comes to criticism of nearly every other institution,\" another comment read.',\n",
       "  'NEW DELHI:  Chief Justice  DY Chandrachud on Thursday, said that simply establishing  arbitration institutions  is not enough, and measures must be taken to prevent these dispute resolution centers from being dominated by a \"self-perpetuating clique.\" Speaking at the   of the United Kingdom, Chandrachud urged countries like India to rise to the challenge of fostering and promoting a culture of commercial arbitration. He believes that the strong institutionalization of arbitration will contribute to the development of an arbitration culture in the Global South. \"In recent years, institutions such as India International Arbitration Centre and Mumbai and Delhi International Arbitration Centers have been set up and are seeing a steady flow of arbitration matters. But the mere creation of institutions is not sufficient. We have to ensure that these new institutions are not controlled by a  self-perpetrating clique . These institutions must be based on the foundation of robust professionalism and the ability to generate consistent arbitral processes,\" the CJI said. The CJI also pointed out that arbitration is no longer just an \"alternative\" of dispute resolution but has become the preferred approach for seeking commercial justice.  The CJI stressed that transparency and accountability, which are used to assess and critique the work of traditional courts, should not be foreign to the world of arbitration.  Chandrachud also expressed his hope that Indian arbitral institutions will emulate the success of their global counterparts in the coming years. He said, \"Arbitral institutions are uniquely placed to cooperate with other arbitral institutions around the world to adopt best international practices and procedures. This will create a global convergence of arbitral procedures, creating more uniform institutional rules and structures. I hope the Indian arbitral institutions emulate the success of their global counterparts in the years to come.\" Chandrachud reiterated that the substitution of courts should not lead to the creation of opaque structures. He argued that the call for greater diversity in the world of arbitration, whether in terms of gender or from the Global South, is based on the strong belief that bringing a diversity of viewpoints will result in a more broad-based process. He also emphasized the significant role of technology in the arbitration process, noting that it offers cost-effective and time-effective solutions, such as allowing parties and arbitrators from different locations to participate in arbitral proceedings virtually. The CJI highlighted that the adoption of technology at all levels of arbitration proceedings will enhance the efficiency and accessibility of the arbitration process. \"You have instances where one party is based in Delhi, another in Bengaluru, while the arbitrators are in London, Mumbai and Singapore. Technology provides the digital environment allowing them to participate in arbitral proceedings virtually,\" said Chandrachud. Chandrachud also noted that despite the high courts and district courts in India disposing of a significant number of cases in 2023, the courts remain overburdened. He emphasized that the judiciary in India operates on the principle that no case is too small or too big and that every aggrieved person who approaches the courts has the right to a just remedy.  However, he acknowledged that not every case needs to be resolved before a court, and emerging forms of dispute resolution such as arbitration and mediation are gaining acceptance.

       "  'KOLKATA: People from all walks of life - former students of several educational institutions, clay modellers, rickshaw pullers and junior doctors - separately hit the streets of Kolkata on Sunday in continued protest over the rape and murder of a medic in a state-run hospital a month ago. Demanding the arrest of all culprits in the case, the mother of the post-graduate trainee whose body was found in  RG Kar Medical College and Hospital  on August 9 said she had one child and now all the protesting medics are her children.  In south Kolkata, around 4,000 former students of over 40 schools, a large number of them women, walked a distance of 2 km demanding justice for the victim.  The former students of various ages chanted \\'We Want Justice\\' as they walked along Rash Behari Avenue to the crossing of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road from Gariahat.  Ex-students of institutes like Binodini Girls School, Mitra Institution, Garfa High School, Carmel High School and St John\\'s Diocesan took part in the procession, singing the iconic composition of rebel poet Kaji Nazrul Islam: \"Karar oi louho kopat, bhenge phel korre lopat\" (Destroy the iron gates of prison).  A key organiser, Garima Ghosh said, \"Apart from the main demand - punishment for all those involved in the brutal attack-murder of Abhaya (the symbolic name of the victim), we seek safety of women in all workplaces,\" she said.  In another rally from the potters\\' hub of Kumartuli in north Kolkata, clay modellers took out a rally along Rabindra Sarani to Shyambazar five-point crossing, with a girl dressed as Goddess Durga leading the procession.  Singing Arijit Sing\\'s song \\'Aar kabe\\' (how long) in solidarity with sexually violated women, the protesters held aloft placards demanding speedy investigation and justice in the R G Kar murder-rape incident.  Sculptor Sanatan Dinda and singer Lagnajita were also part of the procession.  \"One month has passed, but the fire within us will rage on till the culprits are flushed,\" Dinda said.  Lagnajita, a known face of the movement, said, \"We will not rest till our sister gets justice. We will peacefully protest even if it lasts for months.\"  Around 100 people with their hand-pulled rickshaws also rallied from Hedua Park to College Square in north Kolkata.  \"We demand justice for Abhaya - who is our daughter,\" said Rameshwa Shaw, a rickshaw puller who is originally from Darbhanga in Bihar.  Hundreds of junior doctors of state-run NRS Hospital took out a rally from Sealdah to Esplanade in the heart of the city.  The parents of the murdered doctor were present at the spot in Esplanade where the rally culminated.  The victim\\'s mother said, \"Whenever I think about the torment, the pain experienced by my daughter on that night, I shudder. She had dreams to serve the society, Now, all these protesters are all my children.\"  Hundreds of junior doctors of R G Kar hospital - the epicentre of the movement since August 10 - formed a human chain at 5 pm and sang the national anthem holding the tri-colour.  They were joined by other citizens near a stage of left organisations SFI and DYFI.  At Hazra crossing in south Kolkata, several members of the Bengali entertainment industry sat on a dharna demanding justice for the deceased medic. They came to the spot in a procession from Tollygunge to Hazra, a distance of over 2 km.  Protest rallies were also held in several other places in West Bengal.  A scuffle broke out in one such march at Naihati in North 24 Parganas district after a group of youths, allegedly associated with the ruling Trinamool Congress entered into the rally.  The group accused the protesters of blocking the arterial Ghospara Road.  \"The group of men snapped the wire of a loudspeaker fitted on the top of a vehicle which was part of the rally and beat up some of the participants,\" one of the protestors alleged.  The police brought the situation under control.  Meanwhile, thousands of people were expected to hit the streets in various parts of the state at midnight on Sunday in the third edition \\'Reclaim the Night\\' campaign.  After the success of the first such gathering on August 14, the second edition was organised on September 4.',\n",
       "  'Kamala Devi Harris, born on October 20, 1964 in Oakland California, is currently serving as the 49th vice president of the United States alongside President Joe Biden since 2021. She holds the distinction of being the first woman to serve as vice president, making her the highest-ranking female official in U.S. history, as well as the first African American and Asian American to hold the office. Harris is the Democratic Party\\'s presidential nominee for the 2024 election. On Sunday, July 21, US President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, officially endorsing Vice President   as the partyâ\\x80\\x99s new nominee. Harris\\'s remarkable education journey started at a high school in Quebec when she moved to Canada with her mother and sister at 12 years of age. After successfully completing high school Harris advanced to earn a major in Political Science and Economics from  Howard University . Following her graduation, she took admission to the University of California, Hastings College of Law to attain a law degree in 1989.  Howard played an instrumental role in building the career trajectory of Harris. Take a look at the history of the esteemed university and its significant firsts. Founded in 1867 in Washington, D.C., Howard University was established to provide education to freed African-Americans after the Civil War. Named after General Oliver Otis Howard, a Civil War hero and commissioner of the Freedmenâ\\x80\\x99s Bureau, the university emerged as a symbol for Black excellence and educational empowerment. Initially established as a seminary for Black ministers, Howard evolved into a full-fledged institution with diverse academic disciplines, including medicine, law, and the arts. The university has played a significant role in the fight for civil rights and the advancement of African-Americans. Its law school, established in 1869, played a crucial role in shaping legal minds including Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court Justice of the US.  Howard\\'s legacy is rooted in its alumni, who have broken racial barriers across various fields. Apart from Harris, the other notable graduates include Toni Morrison, Nobel laureate in literature; Kamala Harris, and Ralph Bunche, the first African-American Nobel Peace Prize winner. The university\\'s status as \"The Mecca\" reflects its role as a cultural and intellectual hub for Black students worldwide, symbolizing resilience, leadership, and progress in the face of historical challenges. Howard University has been the source of numerous historic firsts, from establishing the first Black law school to producing the first African-American Nobel laureate in literature. These milestones highlight the institution\\'s pivotal role in shaping the career paths of its students. Howard University established the first law school at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU), becoming a hub for training African-American legal professionals. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are higher education institutions in the United States that were founded prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with a primary focus on serving African American students. Many of these institutions were established during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War and are predominantly located in the Southern United States. Howard University was the first Black university to have an Army Reserve Officersâ\\x80\\x99 Training Corps (ROTC) program. Howard University initiated structured military training for Black officers in 1917 and established an official ROTC program in 1918. The objective was to provide Black military personnel with opportunities beyond infantry roles. Since its founding, the Howard Army ROTC has commissioned over 1,000 officers, many of whom have achieved the rank of general. Howard is a leading institution in producing Black candidates for both the Army and the Air Force. Ralph Bunche, a Howard alumnus, became the first African-American to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his mediation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Supported by a scholarship from Harvard University and a $1,000 fund raised by the Black community in Los Angeles, Bunche commenced his graduate studies in political science. He earned his master\\'s degree in 1928 and spent the following six years splitting his time between teaching at Howard University and pursuing his doctoral studies at Harvard. Howard Law alumnus Thurgood Marshall became the first African-American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, making significant contributions to civil rights, including the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Marshall pursued his education at Lincoln University before attending the Howard University School of Law. There, he was guided by Charles Hamilton Houston, lawyer and the then dean of Howard University Law School, who encouraged his students to become \"social engineers\" dedicated to leveraging the law in the battle for civil rights. Robert C. Weaver, a Howard graduate, became the first African-American to serve as a U.S. Cabinet member when he was appointed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Weaver attended M Street High School, now known as Dunbar High School, which was renowned for its academic excellence during the era of racial segregation. He later pursued his education at Harvard University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Arts degree. Weaver also earned a Ph.D. in Economics, completing his doctorate in 1934. Howard University launched WHUR, the first commercial radio station owned and operated by an African-American university. WHUR, the first radio station in the Washington metropolitan area to adopt HD broadcasting, has been granted numerous accolades, including the esteemed NAB Marconi Award for Best Urban Station of the Year and the NAB Crystal Radio Award for Excellence in Community Service. On January 21, 2004, Howard Universityâ\\x80\\x99s WHUR-FM Radio transitioned to digital broadcasting, making it the first commercial station in the region to implement HD RadioTM technology. Subsequently, on November 16, 2006, WHUR-WORLD, 96.3 HD-2, was introduced, featuring a diverse blend of music and information with the same superior audio quality as its parent station, WHUR. Ernest J. Wilson III, a Howard alumnus, became the first African-American to hold the position of Vice President at the World Bank. During his thirteen years with the Bank, Black guided the organization from its early, uncertain stages to becoming a prominent, efficient, and profitable development institution. He secured the Bank\\'s reputation in U.S. capital markets, ensured its bonds were acceptable to major institutional investors, and achieved the highest commercial rating for its securities. Carol Moseley Braun, a Howard law graduate, became the first African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Before serving in the U.S. Senate, Moseley Braun was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1979 to 1988 and held the position of Cook County Recorder of Deeds from 1988 to 1992. Toni Morrison, a Howard graduate, became the first African-American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Toni Morrison, renowned for her lyrical novels such as \"Song of Solomon,\" \"Beloved,\" and \"Jazz,\" received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. The Swedish Academy\\'s Nobel Committee announced the award in Stockholm, highlighting that Morrison \"brings to life a crucial aspect of American reality\" through novels marked by \"visionary power and poetic significance.\" Howard alumna Kamala Harris made history as the first Black woman to become Vice President of the United States. Harris, originally from Oakland, California, completed her education at Howard University and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She started her legal career with the Alameda County District Attorney\\'s Office, then moved to the San Francisco District Attorney\\'s Office and later worked with the City Attorney of San Francisco. In 2003, she was elected District Attorney of San Francisco. She served as California\\'s Attorney General from 2010 to 2014, becoming the first woman, as well as the first African American and Asian American, to hold these positions in the state\\'s history.']}"
