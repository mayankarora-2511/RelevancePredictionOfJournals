0,Wall Street Shuns Risk Before Coin-Toss Election: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Stocks failed to gain traction and bonds climbed, with polls continuing to depict a tight race in the US presidential election ahead of the Federal Reserve rate decision.In the run-up to Tuesday’s vote, equity traders decided to stay on the sidelines as a flurry of polls showed Americans remain narrowly split between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The likelihood of a disputed result could eventually drag the vote count out for weeks or even months. For many, that means one thing — a potential rise in volatility. Treasuries rose across the curve and the dollar dropped the most in over a month.Another factor that’s preventing traders from making riskier bets is the number of additional catalysts surrounding the vote. Election Day will quickly be followed on Thursday by the Fed decision and Jerome Powell’s press conference, where he’ll give details on the central bank’s interest-rate path. And a big chunk of US companies are still due to report their earnings.“Normally, the Fed rate announcement would dominate the week’s discussion, but this isn’t just any week,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Traders and investors who have been waiting for the outcome of the election have to prepare themselves for the possibility of a delayed outcome, and the potential impact of that.”Regarding equity performance, the S&P 500 tends to see positive returns to close out the year after Election Day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. For all years since 1990, the median gain has been 3.3%. For election years, performance has tended to be modestly stronger, with a median gain of 3.9%.The S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.6%. In late hours, Palantir Technologies Inc. rallied on an earnings beat, while citing “unwavering” artificial-intelligence demand. NXP Semiconductors NV tumbled after giving a disappointing forecast. Treasury 10-year yields declined nine basis points to 4.29%. Bitcoin fell 2.6%. Oil climbed after OPEC+ agreed to push back its December production increase and Iran outlined a possible response to Israel’s recent bombardment.From stocks and Treasuries to currencies and commodities, rarely has anxiety been as pronounced at this point of the cycle. A gauge of cross-asset risk kept by Bank of America Corp. jumped to the highest point of any pre-election week outside of the financial crisis. “Investor sentiment could take a turn for the worse over the very short-term, especially if there is uncertainty over the winner of the presidential election or if it takes longer-than-expected to declare a winner,” said Carol Schleif at BMO Family Office. “Sooner or later, the election result will be finalized, and any volatility from this is an opportunity in our view.”Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, are expected to sell US and global stocks no matter which direction the market goes, according to the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trading desk.“Our models assume that over the week CTAs are going to be material sellers in any market scenario,” it said.JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas expects US equities will climb into the final stretch of 2024 once the results of the US presidential election are declared, particularly if the outcome is political gridlock.“Under either gridlock scenario, we think equities reprice higher as we clear the uncertainty, volatility decreases and hedges unwind, with investors refocusing on the Federal Reserve at a time when the economy and corporate earnings remain resilient,” he wrote.The S&P 500 can keep climbing into the final stretch of 2024, with a 5% gain from here not out of the question, as investors exhale after the US presidential election passes and year-end FOMO kicks in, according to Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson. But with no clear catalysts in sight, that enthusiasm is likely to fade as the calendar turns to 2025, the strategist warns. The sustainability of any upward move in equities if Trump wins the election is likely to depend on the magnitude of bond yields’ response, according to JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka.A Trump win and a positive market reaction are widely expected at this point, and investors are already long equities “which could lead to travel and arrive at some point,” they said. If Harris wins, the uncertainty over the path of corporate taxes would increase near term. Over the medium term, equities might see some support from the reduced tariffs risk, the strategists noted.While volatility has been elevated, it’s pointing to about a 1.7% move for the S&P 500 the day after the election — not an outrageous swing. The implied move has fallen steadily from a peak of around 2% in early October to be about in line with the long-term average for past elections, according to Stefano Pascale, head of US equity-derivatives strategy at Barclays Plc.Beyond the general indexes, some sectors, such as crypto and clean-energy stocks, are seeing a surge in volatility well above their medians. Crypto stocks are pricing almost 10% moves, Morgan Stanley’s trading desk said last week, and those for renewable firms around 6%. That’s playing out in positioning, where, for example, more than 20,000 November call spreads were bought last week in Sunrun Inc.","November 5, 2024 - 13:58"
1,UK Labour promises ‘new towns’ to tackle housing shortage,"LONDON (Reuters) – Britain’s opposition Labour Party will pledge on Tuesday to work with the private sector to build so-called “new towns” aimed at meeting its commitment to construct 1.5 million new homes across Britain if it wins power.Before a national election later this year, housebuilding, or the lack of it, has become increasingly important to voters in Britain, where many thousands cannot afford to buy homes, while others protest against new developments in rural areas.The governing Conservatives under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were forced to water down their 2019 manifesto commitment to build 300,000 homes annually in England, describing the target as advisory after pressure from some of the party’s lawmakers not to carry out the plan.Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, will set out plans for a new generation of the “new towns” built after World War Two to provide new housing after the conflict.“Developers who deliver on their obligations to build high quality, well designed and sustainable affordable housing, with green spaces and transport links and schools and GP surgeries nearby, will experience a new dawn under Labour,” she said in a statement. “But those who have wriggled out of their responsibilities for too long will be robustly held to account.”She did not elaborate.Labour is way ahead of the Conservatives in the polls, but officials in the party fear they have yet to win over a large number of undecided voters, and hope that by setting out their policies in more detail they can strengthen their lead. Critics say Labour has yet to offer enough detail on its policies.Last week, Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has pulled his party towards the centre ground after it had veered to the left, promised to “rebuild Britain”, setting out what he called the first steps in government if his party won the election.","May 20, 2024 - 23:32"
2,"EU’s Borrell to discuss security, climate policy with Vietnam next week","By Francesco GuarascioHANOI (Reuters) – European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell will visit Vietnam next week to discuss how to boost cooperation with the Southeast Asian country in areas including security and sustainable development, the EU ambassador in Hanoi said.Vietnam is an important trading partner for the European Union (EU), attracting the attention of global powers as it benefits from shifts in multinationals’ supply chains caused by growing tensions between the United States and China.In a visit planned for July 29-31, Borrell will discuss with Vietnamese authorities “how to further reinforce EU-Vietnam cooperation in key areas for our mutual future sustainable development and security,” EU ambassador Julien Guerrier told Reuters.The EU and Vietnam have a free trade agreement in place since 2020, which has turned the Asian industrial hub into the EU’s top trading partner in Southeast Asia for goods.Several EU companies have made important investments in the country, including Germany’s engineering giant Bosch, Danish toymaker Lego, French pharmaceutical group Sanofi and Italy’s motor bike manufacturer Piaggio. Shoemaker Adidas has dozens of suppliers in Vietnam.Hanoi has also signed a Just Energy Transition Partnership with Western and Group of Seven (G7) nations, under which it is eligible to receive billions of dollars in EU funds to reduce its reliance on coal and boost renewables.However, divisions remain on human rights and foreign policy. Vietnam’s abstention from condemning Russia’s military escalation in Ukraine is seen in some EU capitals as a position too close to Moscow.Vietnam’s postponement in May of a visit to Hanoi by the special envoy for the implementation of EU sanctions, David O’Sullivan, attracted explicit criticism from the EU, as it was seen as a favour to Russia.Borrell, who is just at the end of his five-year tenure, will ensure “irritants are solved,” EU ambassador Guerrier said, noting O’Sullivan’s visit is now planned for September.Borrell will visit Vietnam after attending a meeting in Laos of foreign affairs ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Since September, Hanoi has hosted state visits from U.S. President Joe Biden, China’s leader Xi Jinping and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. No EU Commission President has visited Vietnam in ten years, since Jose Manuel Barroso travelled to the country in August 2014.","July 22, 2024 - 11:02"
3,Swiss students drive rocket research forward ,"Audrey Vorburger conducts research on space instruments and the solar system. As an astrophysicist and planetologist at the University of Bern, rockets are key to her work. “Switzerland is already known for its high-precision engineering and its ability to develop complex scientific instruments,” she says. A national space programne would bolster these strengths. “Access to space is no longer the sole preserve of the major space-faring nations,” Vorburger adds. “With technological advances and internationally accessible launch capacities, smaller countries can also play a significant role.” Student projects, which are numerous in Switzerland, could play an important role in the development and promotion of Swiss space technology and the training of future specialists in this field. swissinfo.ch visited students working on two different projects. The air buzzes with anticipation at a gravel pit outside Gruyère in the canton of Fribourg. As the clock ticks past 4 p.m., a young crew is busy with final preparations. In a freight container on a workbench, lies the object that is the focus of all the attention. Every move is meticulously choreographed as one of its four legs undergoes a small repair. At the heart of this endeavor stands a remarkable creation: Colibri. Towering at 2.45 meters and weighing 100 kilograms, this rocket is not just a feat of engineering; it’s a symbol of aspiration. What sets Colibri apart from other rockets in Europe is its ability to land safely back on Earth, upright on its legs. But it took a long time to get to this point. Behind this project of the  Gruyère Space Program

me are five young students who have known each other since secondary school and continued together at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). “No one in Europe has so far launched a rocket with a payload and had it land on its feet again,” says Julie Böhning, a 25-year-old robotics student and the spokesperson for the team. “It’s great that we did all this development together.” In the container, the team has assembled all the individual parts of the rocket in a fully functional state on a test stand. Tanks, engine, electronics, sensors, every component can be tested independently of each other.  Eight people are present in the gravel pit today, including founding members Jérémy Marciacq, 26, and Simon Both, 25. They are checking various data streams on their laptops. After the test, they will analyse the data in detail. At a safe distance, the team has quickly set up a mobile control centre. The rocket is refuelled and a small drone flies another inspection tour around the ready-to-launch Colibri. It is too dangerous for people to approach the rocket when the fuel tanks are full. “Five, four, three, two, one”, the countdown begins. Then a loud noise, and the rocket rises a few meters into the air as planned. On its 25th attempt, it must veer slightly off course mid-air to demonstrate it can return to the small take-off and landing platform autonomously. Apart from a few minor hiccups, the trial proceeds satisfactorily. The daily goal was achieved, Both says. It was important to test new algorithms for the rocket landing which, of course, the students had programmed themselves. Such a test would normally require a special permit in Switzerland. But because the rocket’s tip is suspended from a cable with an emergency stop function on a crane jib, Colibri is legally classified as a ground object. The test must be conducted at least 200 metres away from the nearest residential building. That requirement is amply met. They built the rocket with simple and cheap materials. “Typically, the Colibri’s tanks are pipes from a construction site that we obtained and modified,” Böhning says. The team also relies on 3D printing to be able to replace certain parts within a very short time, independently of suppliers. The students do everything themselves. Of course, this would not be possible without sponsors. They now have 55 industrial partners. These include the company that provides them with access to the gravel pit and the crane free of charge. Marciacq had to complete extra training to be able to operate the crane. The young rocket enthusiasts have brought a renowned mentor into the project: Claude Nicollier, the first Swiss astronaut. Their status as students allows them to contact all kinds of experts around the world who would be happy to spend a few hours giving them advice, Böhning says. But what is the aim of their project? “We want to use this demonstrator to show that we in Europe are also capable of launching rockets and bringing them back down again,” she says. Another day, another location. This time we are in a hangar at the Dübendorf military airfield in the canton of Zurich. This is where Swiss aviation began. Some of the hangars are now occupied by the Innovation Park, home to an array of student projects and start-ups. These include the ARIS space project, led by students and supported by several institutes and universities including ETH Zurich. Small and large rockets from earlier projects are lined up in a row. The current rocket project, NICOLLIER

, is named after the Swiss astronaut. He took part online in the second technical review of the rocket and gave the team feedback, according to Felix Hattwig, the 21-year-old project manager, a physics student at ETH Zurich.  This project also relies on a reusable rocket. It has two built-in parachutes — a so-called guided recovery system. A small parachute helps the rocket brake as soon as it has reached its highest point in flight, explains Matteo Vass, a 20-year-old engineering student who is the head of the recovery team, and therefore responsible for the braking system. A larger steering parachute, controlled by an autonomous software system, is then deployed around 800 metres above the ground. It is designed to bring the rocket to the landing point. The team is currently carrying out “drop tests”. The Swiss army is helping by dropping the rocket from a helicopter to simulate the landing. This does not, of course, take place above populated areas, but at military bases — for example in the canton of Glarus or in the Bernese Oberland. However, the rainy spring is creating problems for the Nicollier team. Only two of the 13 planned drop tests could be carried out. A video of the rocket in action shows the test works well and the rocket finds its landing site. “This is a new era of space travel, where it’s not just about the rocket itself, but about new systems around it,” says Hattwig. Above all, autonomous control. But not only that: “Our rocket has more to offer than guided recovery, even if that is a major challenge,” he says. “We are also trying to achieve technical innovations in other areas.”  For example, in the area of computer boards, which are interchangeable in their rocket. Or with the air brakes, where they are also breaking new ground. The 43 active members are also working on this project alongside their studies and receive neither a salary nor credit points. So, a lot of passion is involved. Both students have been fascinated by space travel since they were children and are now looking forward to making their dream come true. Between 40 and 50 sponsors are involved.  Their rocket has not yet launched, but previous ARIS projects have already paved the way forward. The first launch is currently planned for the end of October in Switzerland, according to Hattwig. Ultimately, the goal is to launch three different payloads, i.e. satellites. The Gruyère Space Program has scheduled its first demo flight for the end of September, with Nicollier among the invited guests. The students will then also reveal what will happen next, after their project is completed. “We all get on so well that we want to explore new territory as a company,” Böhning says. It will no longer be about rockets but will involve the same technology that they have been working on for years. She doesn’t want to reveal any more just yet. “What these and other students are achieving deserves a great deal of respect,” writes the Swiss Space Office, the federal government’s competence centre for national and international space affairs in response to a SWI swissinfo.ch query.  The Swiss projects are “very successful” by international standards, it said. Such projects would “form a good and practical basis for the training of students in order to prepare them for future tasks in the space sector”. It also notes that the “obvious” issues of “costs – recyclability – sustainability” are sure to continue posing a challenge for all those working in space research and space agencies tomorrow and in the future.

4,Save the dates: a ‘year of democracy’,"More than twice as many people will be called to vote in 2024 than in 2023. Eight of the ten most populous countries in the world will hold elections. India alone is home to 1.4 billion people. In Pakistan, Indonesia, the United States, the 27 countries of the European Union, and (probably) Britain, hundreds of millions of people will be able to have their say in the next 12 months. The Economist

has called 2024 “the biggest election year in history”.However, as British playwright Tom Stoppard once pointed out, “it’s not the voting that’s democracy, it’s the counting”. Many of the elections taking place are not free and fair and are highly unlikely to have a meaningful influence on governments. You don’t need to be an experienced Kremlinologist to predict that Vladimir Putin, this year celebrating 25 years at the top in Russia, will be re-elected in March.Then there’s artificial intelligence. What roll will AI play in the various elections? What steps are governments and political parties taking? AI has already fabricated scandals on Swiss politicians.But maybe it’s too soon to get too pessimistic about a democratic crisis. “For all its swagger, its sense of historical momentum, the autocratic world is nowhere near to reversing the losses that it suffered in the second half of the 20th century,” Janan Ganesh writes in the Financial Times

Taiwan, home to 24 million people, is holding presidential and parliamentary elections. The outcome could shape how Chinese President Xi Jinping pursues his goal of taking control of what Beijing considers “sacred” Chinese territory. Switzerland, which doesn’t recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state, will continue to walk a fine line between promoting peace and democracy and not irritating China.February 8. Pakistan (240 million people) is set to hold a general election (postponed from November). February 14. Indonesia is holding presidential and legislative elections. Three candidates are vying to succeed incumbent President Joko Widodo, who is finishing up the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution. About 205 million of Indonesia’s more than 270 million people are eligible to vote and about a third of those are under the age of 30.March 3. Voters in Switzerland will head to the polls on the first of four voting Sundays (the others are on June 9, September 22 and November 24). The two federal issues to be decided involve pension reform.March 15 (until March 17). In Russia (population 140 million), Vladimir Putin’s re-election as president seems assured after years of cracking down on political opposition. That means Russia’s war on Ukraine also looks set to continue, testing the patience of Kyiv’s main ally, the United States. Switzerland is set to continue implementing EU sanctions on Russia, but questions will no doubt continue to be asked about Swiss neutrality.March 31. Municipal elections in Turkey (population 85 million). Can President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, narrowly re-elected in May, tighten his rule by winning back the cities he lost in 2019? Relations between Turkey and Switzerland have been better: Erdogan took exception to an effigy of him being burnt in Zurich last year, with the result that the Swiss ambassador in Ankara was summoned for an earful.A general election will be held in India, the world’s most populous country, in April and May. Narendra Modi, another self-styled strongman, is sailing towards re-election as prime minister, having nurtured an uncompromising leadership style that plays well to many voters and foreign investors but riles human rights groups. If Modi’s Hindu nationalist party wins, the economy rather than rights is expected to remain his main focus.The British prime minister, currently Rishi Sunak, must call a general election by January 28, 2025, but many pundits reckon it will be this spring or autumn. It will be the first nationwide election in the UK in which voters will have to show photo ID at the polling station. Will many people be turned away at voting booths?May 11. The music might not be to everyone’s taste, but most people will acknowledge the technical – and democratic? – achievements in broadcasting the Eurovision Song Contest. Last year votes were gathered from 144 countries. This year’s final is coming from Malmö, Sweden.May 31. Mexico (130 million people) is holding presidential and legislative elections (until June 2). As this SWI swissinfo.ch article explains, Mexicans have not forgotten the events that made them distrust the ballot box.A general election in South Africa, home to more than 60 million people, is due sometime between May and August. After three decades of government marred by graft and economic decline, the African National Congress (ANC) risks losing its parliamentary majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994 at the end of apartheid. If so, the ANC may need a coalition partner to stay in power – likely either the Democratic Alliance, popular with white voters, or the Economic Freedom Fighters, a Marxist party favoured by poor black voters. Either way, South African democracy will have turned a corner.June 6. Elections to the European Parliament (until June 9). The EU’s 27 member states will elect the bloc’s next parliament. The EU is on track to receive over one million asylum applications this year – will it shift to the right, as the Swiss parliament did in October?July 15. Rwanda (13 million people) is holding presidential and legislative elections. President Paul Kagame will seek to extend his roughly three decades in control of the East African country. He is eligible to continue in office for another decade, after a constitutional amendment in 2015 changed term limits.September 15. UN International Day of Democracy. This year’s theme hasn’t been announced yet, but past themes have included stronger democracies, the importance of democracy for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, strengthening the voices of citizens, dialogue and inclusiveness, accountability, and political tolerance. To mark this day five years ago we published “Ten key ingredients for a democratic society”.November 5. The big one. Voters in the United States (population 330 million) will elect their next president, as well as the entire House of Representatives and a third of the Senate. President Joe Biden is likely to face Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, in a repeat of 2020. Trump is currently favourite, at least according to British bookmakers

, but there’s a long way to go. The Financial Times, in its recent predictions for the year
External link
, said it would be very close but Biden would “squeak through”. It warned, however, that “assuming the recent legal hurdles thrown up against Trump standing in Colorado and Maine are overcome, his campaign against Joe Biden will be the nastiest presidential election in US history”.Unsurprisingly, International Geneva will be crossing its fingers for a Biden win. As president from 2016 to 2020, Trump displayed his contempt for multilateralism, casting a pall over the many international organisations in the Swiss city. At his instigation, the US withdrew from several bodies, including the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization (WHO). The result was the rise of China, determined to take advantage of the vacuum left by Washington to put its stamp on the human rights system. Trump’s return to economic protectionism would also certainly be bad news for the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose arbitration system has remained paralysed since the Trump administration.Washington watchers should also pencil March 4 in their diaries: that’s when Trump is set to go on trial for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election.","January 3, 2024 - 16:00"
5,How Switzerland helped make the US-Iran prisoner swap work,"Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis tweeted on September 18 that Switzerland’s ambassador to Iran “accompanied five US prisoners from Tehran to Doha”, where they were handed over to the US authorities. In another tweet, he welcomed the exchange as a “humanitarian gesture” that allowed the release of five American and five Iranian prisoners. “Switzerland has provided facilitation and is ready to continue to do so, in line with its long tradition of good offices,” Cassis wrote.A press release
External link
from the foreign affairs ministry said Switzerland also “facilitated the related transfer of frozen funds from South Korea to Iran”, adding that “the funds may only be used for humanitarian purposes”. According to media reports, the deal included the transfer of $6 billion (CHF5.3 billion) of Iranian money from restricted South Korean accounts to restricted accounts in Qatar. These accounts in Qatar will monitor the cash to ensure it is spent on humanitarian goods and not on items under US sanctions.The foreign affairs ministry press release says Switzerland played a “major role” in the exchange process “by providing its good offices at the request of all the parties involved”.Swiss diplomacy has a long-standing tradition of trying to talk to all sides “to build trust”. “The aim of good offices is to resolve differences and conflicts between and within countries by political means,” says the foreign ministry. “Just trying to the keep channels of communication open is often crucial to preventing disputes from escalating.”Switzerland notably holds a number of so-called protecting powers, where it represents the interests of countries that have broken off diplomatic relations with each other. The Alpine country, traditionally regarded as neutral, currently holds four protecting powers. Switzerland has represented US interests in Iran since 1980.  As well as representing the US in Iran, it also represents Russia in Georgia, Georgia in Russia, Iran in Egypt and Iran in Canada.A protecting power mandate usually means taking on some of a state’s consular tasks, such as issuing visas. The mandated country can also facilitate diplomatic negotiations. This is not the first time Switzerland has helped with prisoner exchanges, including between the US and Iran. In 2019, it facilitated the swap of Xiyue Wang, a Sino-American man detained for three years in Iran, and Massoud Soleimani, detained in the United States, drawing thanks from former US President Donald Trump.The five Americans freed from Iran last Monday made an emotional return to the US the following day. They include US-Iranian dual citizens Siamak Namazi and Emad Sharqi, both businessmen, and Morad Tahbaz, an environmentalist who also holds British nationality. The five were released after years in jail in Iran on what the US said were baseless charges for political leverage.Five Iranians held in American jails mainly on charges of violating US sanctions were released in exchange. Out of the five, three chose not to go back to Iran.Neutral Switzerland has adopted UN and European Union (EU) sanctions against Iran imposed over the country’s nuclear activities and human rights violations. This includes banning the export of weapons, nuclear goods and surveillance equipment. It has also frozen financial assets of some Iranians linked to the government and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. The Alpine nation has come under pressure to follow tougher EU sanctions imposed as a result of the Islamic regime’s crackdown on opposition after Mahsa Amini’s death in custody last year. However, it has not yet done so.The Swiss foreign ministry says
External link
that, as well as the various protecting powers related to Iran, bilateral relations between the two countries “focus on peace and security policy, human rights, the economy, science, sustainable development and migration”.In 2020, Swiss good offices also helped set up a humanitarian aid channel for Iran. This allows Swiss-based companies
External link
to send medicines and other vital goods to Iran despite US sanctions. Back at the end of 2019, Swiss former State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pascale Baeriswyl (now Bern’s ambassador to the UN) told SWI swissinfo.ch that Switzerland’s protecting powers had nearly doubled in recent years from four to seven at that time. “They come to us and want us to be the mediator,” she said, seeing it as a sign of troubled times because “there are a lot of hotspots in the world where countries are starting to downgrade their bilateral relations”.The world is hardly in better shape now, but the number of Swiss protecting powers has gone down to four again. In the case of the dispute between Venezuela and the US, Washington agreed to a Swiss mandate in 2019, but Caracas never approved it. This year, Switzerland lost two protecting mandates for Saudi Arabia in Iran and Iran in Saudi Arabia, after a rapprochement between those two countries facilitated by China. Oman and Iraq were also involved, leaving Switzerland on the side-lines.Swiss good offices have also been snubbed on several recent occasions. In March 2022, it sought to organise talks between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine, however, was hardly interested, and Russia preferred Turkey, where the talks finally took place. When Switzerland offered to take on protecting-power mandates for Ukraine and Russia, Russia again refused the offer. Moscow claims that Switzerland is no longer neutral after it imposed sanctions on Russia for the Ukraine war, in line with the EU.Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis has repeatedly weighed in on discussions about Swiss neutrality with the argument that the country has a special role to play internationally. “The role of diplomacy, of bridge-builder, this is where we can offer added value to all other countries,” Cassis told Swiss public broadcaster SRF

in February this year.But for the moment, Switzerland’s role as mediator appears to be dwindling. If Russia manages to further expand its influence in Georgia, Swiss mandates for these countries may also come to an end in the medium term.","September 20, 2023 - 16:00"
6,"Swiss start-up Destinus enters hypersonic flight race, powered by hydrogen","The goal is ambitious: to develop a 400-passenger hypersonic aircraft that can take you anywhere on earth within half a day.“A direct flight from London to Sydney would take four hours, and we plan for this to happen in the 2040s,” says Martina Löfqvist, head of business development at the aerospace start-up Destinus.Destinus was founded in 2021 in Payerne, western Switzerland, by Mikhail Kokorich, a Russian physicist, inventor and entrepreneur. Kokorich moved to Switzerland and started Destinus after founding and then resigning from the aerospace company Momentus in the United States (see infobox). Destinus has joined the race to produce a new type of plane that is set to fly faster, soar higher and leave a smaller environmental footprint than conventional aircraft, and it’s opened its own hydrogen park to develop the technologies it needs to make this happen. Destinus employs 150 people at branches around Europe and expects the project to cost CHF1 billion ($1.1 billion).But Aerospace expert Eric Tegler, writing for Forbes magazine, dubs Destinus’s goals as similarly unrealistic to those of its competition. “Its timeline, core mission and path to profitability shift every year, putting it on a trajectory as hyperbolic as hypersonic,” he wrote in February.We recently visited the new 1,200-square-metre Destinus Hydrogen Park in Payerne, billed as “the first private test site in Switzerland to develop hydrogen technologies for transport and energy”, to take the pulse of the project and understand the challenges for hydrogen-fuelled planes. Several of those challenges – including sourcing hydrogen – are outlined in the video below.At the park’s ground-breaking ceremony, Destinus showed off its supersonic prototype, Destinus-3. It is ten metres long, has a wingspan of 3.5 metres and is a hybrid between an airplane and a rocket, taking off and landing horizontally from airports using a hydrogen-fed jet engine. The idea is that once it reaches a certain altitude and speed, the plane will switch to a “ramjet” engine, where superheated air is taken in through a duct, mixed with fuel and ignited. That will accelerate it to Mach five, a hypersonic velocity.Although commercial aviation produces only 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it has a big climate impact because of flying at high altitudes. Many other hypersonic airplane models in development burn traditional jet fuel and have a large carbon footprint. Hydrogen would be a cleaner alternative fuel because its combustion emits no greenhouse gases.But the creation of hydrogen fuel is not without carbon emissions because most hydrogen is made by burning fossil fuels. Only when clean energies are used to produce it by water electrolysis can it be called green hydrogen – the only type of truly emission-free hydrogen fuel.+White hydrogen – Switzerland joins the scramble for ‘clean oil’ 
External link Löfqvist says Destinus aims to use green hydrogen in its planes, “but this is not widely available right now and it’s quite expensive. So, in the short term, while we’re developing and testing systems, we will purchase the hydrogen that is easily available and at a lower price”.Green hydrogen costs around CHF24-28 ($27-31) per kilo while the cheaper, readily available hydrogen costs about CHF18 per kilo. A kilogram of jet fuel costs around $1. The high cost of hydrogen is a considerable obstacle to hypersonic hydrogen-fuelled flights.In the future the company will use liquid hydrogen instead of gas, because it can store a lot of energy in a small amount of mass. However, it takes up four times more volume on an aircraft than jet fuel, posing a challenge for the plane’s design.The main suppliers of liquid hydrogen are in France and Germany, requiring Destinus to transport it to Switzerland. “But it’s also possible that we will get gaseous hydrogen and then liquefy it ourselves,” Löfqvist adds.+ Once a hydrogen vehicle pioneer, Switzerland lags in the green fuel raceDestinus is building another test facility near Madrid to develop its engines and received grants for two projects worth €26.7 million (CHF 29.48 million) from the Spanish government to help expand its hydrogen propulsion capabilities.Destinus has raised about CHF65 million in funding so far, a long way from the “billion Swiss francs” the company says it will need to build a commercial hydrogen-powered hypersonic airplane.Destinus must design its planes for flight at speeds greater than Mach five (about 6,116km/h or 3,800mph). The aircraft will have a blended “body wave rider” shape with no clear dividing line between the wings and the main body of the aircraft. This design could make the aircraft less stable at low speeds, a challenge that Destinus must overcome.Then there’s the heat: the nose cone and wings can reach temperatures above 1,000°C while travelling at five times the speed of sound. When chilled to a liquid at -253°C, hydrogen can be used to help to pre-cool the air for the engine and cool the airframe.Noisy sonic booms were a drawback for Concorde and must also be considered by Destinus. The boom happens when you fly above the speed of sound, at supersonic or hypersonic velocities. During supersonic and hypersonic cruise, Destinus plans to fly above unpopulated areas, such as seas or deserts, to avoid breaking noise regulations. The Destinus developers say their planes will be quiet enough to operate from standard airports for take-off and landing.And, as with Concorde, there are rules governing the maximum g-forces that a passenger experiences during acceleration, which Destinus will have to observe. “Destinus-3 will fly with a kerosene-fuelled turbojet engine for the first time at the end of 2024,” says project founder Kokorich. “In 2025 we will add a hydrogen-powered afterburner to reach supersonic velocities.”Destinus’s first commercial plane will not be manned, but Kokorich says they could use the same engines to build a plane for 25 people. Löfqvist adds: “It could fly from, say, London to New York in one-and-a-half hours. So it’s going to be Concorde, but a bit faster and run entirely on hydrogen.”  +Once a hydrogen vehicle pioneer, Switzerland lags in the green fuel raceDestinus faces stiff competition from a handful of start-ups working on hypersonic flight. The main challengers are Hermeus and Boom Supersonic in the United States.  Hermeus is testing a new type of engine for the US Air Force that it says will eventually reach Mach five. In 2022 it announced a $100 million (CHF91 million) funding round to develop its first prototype aircraft. Its fundraising is led by venture capitalist Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Hermeus will run on conventional jet fuel.The other big competitor, Boom Supersonic, will use sustainable aviation fuel in its Overture jet, but it will not be able to match Destinus’s aimed-for speeds. Boom aims to roll Overture out in 2026, with the first flight planned for 2027. In November, Boom announced it had increased its total funding to more than $700 million.United Airlines has announced that it will purchase 15 Overture models,

scheduled to join United’s fleet no earlier than 2029.Hansjörg Bürgi, editor-in-chief of the Swiss aviation magazine Skynews.ch, says that “it will take years, if not decades, of testing before paying passengers can fly on them for the first time, that’s my guess”.Aviation specialists agree that many hydrogen storage, supply chain and infrastructure challenges have to be overcome before hydrogen-powered aircraft can become a reality in passenger transport, a process that would at best take decades.That doesn’t stop scientists and entrepreneurs like Mikhail Kokorich from dreaming big. “It’s a marathon and not a sprint,” he says. “Our focus now is on generating revenues to continue funding our bold vision.”

7,Australia to build cruise missiles with Norway’s Kongsberg,"By Kirsty NeedhamSYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia said it would jointly manufacture long-range Naval Strike Missiles and Joint Strike Missiles with Norway’s Kongsberg Defence in the city of Newcastle on Australia’s eastern coast, the only site outside of Norway.Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy said the Australian government will contribute A$850 million ($574 million) to establish a manufacturing facility with Kongsberg at the Newcastle Airport precinct later this year, with production to start in 2027.The anti-ship cruise missiles would be used by the Australian Defence Force and also exported by the U.S. security ally, he said. It will be one of only two facilities in the world capable of producing the missiles, and the only site outside Kongsberg, Norway.Australia has said it will establish guided weapons manufacturing under a defence overhaul to boost the Australian Defence Force’s long-range precision strike ability, amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific.“There is huge global demand and constraints on the supply chain around the world. So not only is it cost-competitive to build them here, it will actually deliver the missiles faster than if we were relying on a production line overseas,” Conroy said at a press conference in Newcastle. “There is huge export opportunities for these missiles as well.”The Naval Strike Missile is being used by the U.S. Marines to equip land-based trucks for anti-ship capability, Conroy said.“We will have the capacity not just to sustain and refurbish our missiles; we can potentially do that for United States forces who might be positioned in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.Around 2,000 U.S. Marines have a rotational presence in northern Australia for six months of the year.The Joint Strike Missile is the only strike missile able to be carried in the weapons bay of the F-35 fighter jet.Australia has two F-35 stealth fighter squadrons, based at Williamtown near Newcastle and at RAAF Base Tindal in northern Australia, which is being upgraded by the United States to also host U.S. bomber aircraft.In the Indo Pacific region, Japan and South Korea have F-35 squadrons while Singapore has ordered the fighter jet.Australia is also developing a hypersonic missile with the United States, and will start co-manufacturing guided missiles with the United States next year.($1=1.4815 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney; Editing by Stephen Coates and Lincoln Feast)","August 22, 2024 - 08:22"
8,Canton Valais becomes a new haven for film shoots,"The mini-series Log-Out, co-produced by TF1 and Swiss public television, RTS, is currently being filmed in a disused hangar in Martigny. It’s no coincidence that the production team chose canton Valais, notable for its mountain views, for the majority of the shoot.Philippe Coeytaux, producer at Akka Films, explains: “What’s unique is the dedicated film office, which provides valuable support for anyone coming from abroad or other cantons. They give us advice, help with contacts in local authorities, the police, and fire services. They’ve been a great help, and they also provide financial incentives, so we’re very happy to shoot in Valais.”The canton offers reimbursements of up to CHF100,000 ($115,977) towards production costs. This strategy has attracted a range of projects, from the animated film Sauvages to Winter Palace, Netflix’s first Swiss co-production.Since 2021, the Valais Film Commission has provided CHF610,000 in funding to producers, while the film industry has contributed CHF4 million to the local economy. Spending has primarily gone to accommodation (around CHF1.6 million), labour (around CHF897,000), and catering (around CHF460,000).The Log-Out production team is currently based at the Hôtel des Bains in Saillon. General Manager Dan Meylan says, “For us, these few months represent around eight people and just over 2,500 overnight stays over two and a half months. It’s been very beneficial for our economy.”In addition to the direct economic benefits, these film shoots serve as a valuable tourist showcase for Valais. However, the region faces stiff competition from other Alpine areas, particularly Austria.Tristan Albrecht, head of the Valais Film Commission, acknowledges the challenges: “We need more funding. Tyrol has been in this game for 30 years and has more experience. But we have other advantages: we’re centrally located in Europe, close to everything. It’s up to us to prove we can host major productions.”To sustain this momentum, the canton has committed CHF3 million to develop the Valais film industry by 2028. This investment promises to increase the region’s presence on the big screen and continue boosting the local economy.","October 18, 2024 - 11:00"

In Europe, Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II announced her abdication after over half a century on the throne.Here’s how places and people around the world bid farewell to 2023 and welcomed the New Year.AUSTRALIA – Sydney hailed 2024 with a dazzling fireworks display featuring silver and gold pyrotechnics to mark the 50th anniversary of its famous Opera House.GAZA – People in Gaza had little hope that 2024 will bring much relief after 12 weeks of Israel’s war to eliminate Hamas. In Rafah on Gaza’s border with Egypt, which has become the biggest focal point for Palestinians fleeing other parts of the enclave, people were more preoccupied on Sunday with trying to find shelter, food and water than with thinking about the New Year.“In 2024 I wish to go back to the wreckage of my home, pitch a tent and live there,” said Abu Abdullah al-Agha, a middle- aged Palestinian man whose house in Khan Younis was destroyed and who lost a young niece and nephew in an Israeli air strike.DENMARK – Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II used her annual New Year’s speech on Sunday to announce that she will abdicate on Jan. 14 after 52 years on the throne and will be succeeded by her eldest son, Crown Prince Frederik.RUSSIA – Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing an election in March, made only passing reference in his New Year address on Sunday to his war in Ukraine, hailing his soldiers as heroes but mostly emphasising unity and shared determination.UKRAINE – President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a New Year address said Ukraine had become stronger in overcoming serious difficulties as the war against Russia is almost two years old. He mentioned the word “war” 14 times in a 20-minute address.CHINA – China President Xi Jinping, speaking on Sunday in a televised speech to mark the New Year, said the country will consolidate and enhance the positive trend of its economic recovery in 2024, and sustain long-term economic development with deeper reforms.TAIWAN – President Tsai Ing-wen said that maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is the responsibility of both sides.NORTH KOREA – North Korea vowed to launch three new spy satellites, build military drones and boost its nuclear arsenal in 2024 as leader Kim Jong Un said U.S. policy is making war inevitable, state media reported on Sunday.Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to further develop relationship of cooperation between the two countries in New Year messages exchanged on Monday, South Korea’s Yonhap news reported, citing North Korea’s state radio.THE VATICAN – At his Sunday prayers, Pope Francis said: “I wish everyone a peaceful end of the year, and please do not forget to pray for me”.FRANCE – French President Emmanuel Macron in a televised address ahead of New Year celebrations said 2024 would be “the year of our French pride” marked by the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games and the reopening of Notre-Dame cathedral after a devastating fire.GERMANY – Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in his traditional year-end address that 2023 held “so much suffering and bloodshed,” but promised “we in Germany will get through this.”Police on Sunday detained three more suspects in an alleged Islamist plot to attack Germany’s famed Cologne Cathedral on New Year’s Eve.The alleged attackers had planned to use a car to attack the 800-year-old Gothic cathedral, Cologne police said.BRITAIN – London ushered in the New Year with the bongs of its famous Big Ben bell, fireworks and a display of news highlights that featured King Charles’ coronation.UNITED STATES – In New York, tens of thousands of revellers gathered in Manhattan’s Times Square to watch the lighted ball drop at midnight, after scheduled performances by musicians including Megan Thee Stallion and LL Cool J.President Joe Biden said in an interview ahead of the ball drop that he hoped celebrants realised “we’re in a better position than any country in the world to lead the world.”BRAZIL – A dazzling fireworks spectacle lit up Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach where almost two million people gathered to welcome in the New Year.(Compiled by the Global News Desk; Editing by David Holmes, Jason Neely, Mark Porter and Lisa Shumaker)","January 1, 2024 - 06:26"
10,Britain’s new finance minister ramps up taxes in first Labour budget,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain’s new finance minister Rachel Reeves announced the biggest tax increases in three decades in her first budget, as she accused the Conservatives of leaving public services broken when they lost July’s election after 14 years in power.Reeves said she would raise taxes by 40 billion pounds ($52.04 billion) a year – much of it falling on businesses – to cover a 22 billion-pound shortfall inherited by her Labour Party.Britain’s 10-year gilt yield, which had fallen ahead of the budget, hit a session low at around 4.21% and was last down around 10 bps on the day. Gilt yields have risen this month, partly on unease ahead of the budget.Sterling rose to $1.3021 , reversing the day’s falls. Against the euro, the pound was down 0.3% at 83.39 pence, versus 83.47 pence just before Reeves started speaking .London’s blue-chip FTSE 100 stock index was down 0.3% on the day, trimming earlier falls. The domestically-focused FTSE mid-250 index jumped over 1.5% and was set for its biggest one-day gain since July, while UK bank shares climbed 0.4%.COMMENTS:LINDSAY JAMES, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, QUILTER INVESTORS, LONDON:“What will delight the Chancellor is the financial market reaction. There were fears that stock and bond markets would not react favourably to the announcements today and the loosening of fiscal rules. But for now, gilt yields are down and there is no sign of a repeat of the mini-budget from 2022.”“What now needs to be delivered is economic growth if the recovery in both the public finances and the wider economy is to take place. Whilst re-defining fiscal rules to take account of investment returns is not unreasonable, the timing of it is a direct result of the clear fiscal pressure facing this government.”“Guard rails appear sensible and subject to independent oversight. However with businesses historically providing around 80% of investment, the big question is whether corporate profitability will be weakened that they no longer wish to hold up their end of the bargain to such an extent.”ADRIAN GOSDEN, UK EQUITIES FUND MANAGER, JUPITER ASSET MANAGEMENT:“UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has delivered a tough but fair budget, much of which was already expected as it had been leaked to the market. Sterling is just a little weaker and the cost of government debt fell during her speech. The UK is open for business.”MICHAEL BROWN, MARKET STRATEGIST, PEPPERSTONE, LONDON:“The outlook for UK assets remains a poor one. While gilts have taken the budget in their stride, and Reeves has avoided a Truss-esque market meltdown, the OBR’s (Office for Budget Responsibility) latest forecasts paint a grim picture of sticky high inflation, and stubbornly low economic growth, well below Labour’s desire for 2.5% annual real GDP growth.”“Consequently, gilts are likely to continue to lag developed market peers, while headwinds facing the pound are likely to remain relatively stiff, amid continued, and apparently structural, economic underperformance, particularly when compared to the U.S.”“The BoE must now walk a tightrope, with stagflation becoming an increasingly bigger risk, particularly if today’s measures cause a further decline in both consumer and business sentiment, which has already tumbled in recent months. While a 25 bps cut in November remains nailed-on, a rapid pace of further easing beyond then could well be in doubt, given the cost increases baked in today’s budget.”THIERRY WIZMAN, GLOBAL FX & RATES STRATEGIST, MACQUARIE, NEW YORK:“It’s difficult to take everything in at once, but it seems that the early reaction so far probably justifies Reeves’ behaviour in recent weeks.”“We already had heavy leaking of the budget. We had pessimism over it when it was fist announced. We had plenty of warnings about tough decisions and when it comes out finally, nothing is shocking. If there was something shocking you would see an adverse market reaction.”MICHAEL METCALFE, HEAD OF MACRO STRATEGY, STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS:“Given that there had been a focus in markets and the media about fiscal sustainability, and also because the IMF is talking about this theme, it’s interesting it’s been a relatively positive reaction to the budget.”“The potentially difficult bits of the budget, because they were well flagged, have been priced in. There does seem to be a narrative about taking the deficit seriously so that is being viewed positively.”“This was always going to be difficult balancing act for gilts but it looks like we’ve got through that.“So, what does this mean for the Bank of England? There might have been a question of whether there would be more stimulus and the fact that there isn’t, seems to open the way up for rate cuts.”ABBY GLENNIE, MANAGER OF THE ABRDN UK SMALLER COMPANIES FUND, EDINBURGH:“The government did not quite throw in the hand grenade for AIM (formerly the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market) entrepreneurs and investors that many expected – and valuations of AIM companies ticked up immediately after the announcement, supported by buying demand.”“However, inheritance tax applied on AIM assets at 20% still makes investing in the market less attractive than previously.”KATHLEEN BROOKS, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, XTB, LONDON:“Overall, this budget is not as bad as expected on the tax front. The capital gains tax increase is lower than expected, which suggests that Reeves’ bite is not as bad as feared.”“However, the unexceptional growth forecasts from the OBR, may be higher than the BOE’s rate, but it does not suggest that the UK’s economy will expanding at a rate anything like the level that the US is expanding, in the coming years.”“At this stage, massive tax rises have not spooked financial markets, and instead expectations that the budget deficit will shrink is having a mollifying effect on UK bonds.”LOU BRIEN, MARKET STRATEGIST, DRW TRADING, CHICAGO:“The key to the Chancellor’s UK budget presentation is the reaction of the gilts. A significant decline in 10-year yield demonstrates that the budget passes the ‘Truss test”, indicating the market, at the very least, sees the plan as reasonable.”“There can be discussions about the details, but the record tax rise of 40 billion pounds is probably a good sign that Labour’s return to power will not be marked by an irresponsible accounting of cost and revenues. Not yet anyway.”($1 = 0.7686 pounds)(Reporting by the Reuters Markets Team; Compiled by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Amanda Cooper)","October 30, 2024 - 15:13"
11,"SNB Won’t Hesitate to Raise Rates Further If Needed, Jordan Says","(Bloomberg) — The Swiss National Bank won’t hesitate to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December if necessary, President Thomas Jordan said.“We will review whether the measures we have taken to date are sufficient to keep inflation within the price stability range on a sustainable basis,” Jordan told a conference of central bankers on Tuesday in Zurich.“To this end, we will monitor the development of inflation closely in the coming weeks,” he added. “The SNB thus remains pragmatic, consistent and determined, in line with our risk management approach.”His remarks come two months after the SNB paused monetary tightening, citing steady inflation in its target range. While economists expect that Switzerland’s central bank has reached its terminal rate at 1.75%, officials maintain that further hikes are not off the table.Jordan said it had become “considerably more difficult to balance the risk of tightening too much against the risk of tightening too little.”He said having a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach also involves challenges, adding that central banks should avoid erratic monetary policy moves and maintain a “medium-term orientation.”Jordan addressed an annual high-level conference organized by the SNB, the Bank for International Settlements and the Federal Reserve.

12,S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Wall Street traders sent stocks and bonds sliding after another hot inflation report signaled the Federal Reserve will be in no rush to cut rates this year. Oil climbed as geopolitical jitters resurfaced.Equities extended their April losses, with the S&P 500 down about 1% as the consumer price index beat forecasts for a third month. In a hawkish reprice of the Treasury curve, 10-year yields topped 4.5% and Fed swaps are now showing bets on only two rate cuts for 2024. A sharp reversal in oil also weighed on sentiment, with Bloomberg News reporting the US and its allies believe major missile or drone strikes by Iran or its proxies on Israel are imminent.As the Fed rides the “last mile” toward its 2% inflation goal, the concern is that price pressures may not be just a “bump in the road” — with the higher-for-longer rate narrative taking hold. Minutes of the last Fed meeting showed “almost all” officials judged it would be appropriate to pivot “at some point” this year. But inflation since then has upended market bets.“It’s often said that the Fed takes the escalator up and the elevator down when setting rates,” said Richard Flynn at Charles Schwab. “But for the path downwards in this cycle, it looks like they will opt for the stairs.”The Fed minutes also showed policymakers “generally favored” slowing the pace at which they’re shrinking the asset portfolio by roughly half.The S&P 500 dropped to around 5,160. US two-year yields surged 23 basis points to 4.97%. The dollar jumped the most since January. A weak $39 billion sale of 10-year bonds also boosted yields. Brent crude topped $90. The yen plunged through a level that Wall Street has warned could push Japan to step into the market.The March core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, increased 0.4% from February, according to government data out Wednesday. From a year ago, it advanced 3.8%, holding steady from the prior month.These inflation figures — alongside the jobs report released last week — complicate the timing of the Fed’s rate cuts, according to Tiffany Wilding at Pacific Investment Management Co. Not only there’s now a strong case to push out the timing of the first reduction past mid-year, it also strengthens the odds that the US will ease policy at a more gradual rate than its developed-market counterparts, she noted.“Inflation right now is like the ‘stubborn child’ that refuses to heed the parent’s call to leave the playground,” said Jason Pride at Glenmede. “As a result, investors should be prepared for a higher-for-longer monetary regime.”That doesn’t mean rates are going higher — but the distance to a rate cut is another quarter, according to Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group.“You can kiss a June interest-rate cut goodbye,” said Greg McBride at Bankrate. “There is no improvement here, we’re moving in the wrong direction.”To Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research, Fed officials are still cutting this year — but they won’t be starting in June.“I think July is probable, which means two cuts remain a reasonable baseline,” Dutta said. “If the Fed does not get a cut off in July, however, investors will need to worry about path dependency. As an example, would September be too close to the election? If not June, then July. If not July, then December.”At the start of the year, the amount of easing priced in for 2024 exceeded 150 basis points. That expectation was based on the view that the US economy would slow in response to the Fed’s 11 rate hikes over the past two years. Rather, growth data has broadly exceeded expectations.While Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stressed that financial conditions are weighing on the economy, many market-based measures suggest otherwise. Stocks have added $12 trillion in value since October alone, contributing to readings in a gauge of financial conditions tracked by Bloomberg that are looser now than before the Fed began tightening.“Easy financial conditions continue to provide a significant tailwind to growth and inflation. As a result, the Fed is not done fighting inflation and rates will stay higher for longer,” said Torsten Slok at Apollo Global Management. “We are sticking to our view that the Fed will not cut rates in 2024.”Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers went a step further to say that one would have to “take seriously the possibility that the next rate move will be upwards rather than downwards.” Such a likelihood is somewhere in the 15% to 25% range, he told Bloomberg Television’s Wall Street Week with David Westin.Despite early evidence of a re-heating economy, the bar for Fed hikes at this stage is quite high, according to Lauren Goodwin at New York Life Investments.“A signal that interest rates could move higher would likely be met with a rapid tightening in market financial conditions,” she noted. “We believe there is enough evidence of gradually expanding cracks in the economy to keep further tightening off the table unless inflation accelerates meaningfully.”Another hot CPI reading may have been “the final nail in the coffin” for a June rate cut, but it remains to be seen whether 2024 will turn out to be a two-cut year, or something less, according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.To Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance, the Fed still has a bias to cut rates and is likely to do so in either July or September. Still, if inflation remains sticky, that may be the only rate cut we get this year.“Goldilocks has left the building,” he added. “Inflation isn’t coming down anymore and rate-cut hopes are going to be pushed off even further into the future.”Traders and policymakers alike risk reading too much into the hotter-than-expected US inflation print that jolted markets and called into question the central bank’s interest-rate cutting cycle, according to a top macro strategist at Citadel.“It was never going to be a steady path. We’re seeing bumps, and the bumps are just part of the game,” Angel Ubide at Citadel told Bloomberg Television. “Unless there’s a policy mistake — and I’m not saying that there will be — we should see inflation converging gradually towards 2%,” he said.Traders spooked by Wednesday’s hotter-than-expected inflation print need not to worry, according to Jefferies’ David Zervos — who says risk assets can thrive with or without interest rate cuts by the Fed.US equities are likely to continue their uptrend based on good economic news, which Zervos, the bank’s chief market strategist, expects to swamp discussions about keeping rates higher for longer.Another aspect to consider is that this year’s selloffs have been short-lived, given the equities benchmark’s torrid rally from its October low, which has been powered by Corporate America’s improving earnings outlooks and a resilient US economy.For one thing, the S&P 500 has rebounded after each of the prior four days in 2024 when it sold off at least 1% — averaging a gain of roughly 1% the following session, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.As the hot inflation print all but removed the possibility of rate cuts in the near future, that leaves earnings as a last leg of support for the resilient stock market rally that began last year.“The reaction to the CPI report adds further fuel to the belief that equity markets are in for a period of sluggishness,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “As the focus shifts to earnings season, investors may watch with a different lens, with strong results potentially further adjusting rate cut assumptions, returning us to a ‘good news is bad news’ posture.”To Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers, risk assets are approaching a fork in the road. “If the Fed implicitly accepts price pressures between 3% and 4%, the inflation put has been born, providing another stabilizing force on top of the traditional Fed and dividend puts,” Torres said. “But if the central bank remains committed to 2%, hell or high water, then a meaningful equities correction will occur. This correction could be significant, with equity valuations expanding mainly due to expectations that the Fed will make significant rate cuts this year.”Torres said that would would help sustain corporate earnings while reducing the likelihood of the economy entering a recession.“We find ourselves in an environment where stocks appear fully valued, market interest rates are climbing and the consensus expectation for Federal Reserve rate cuts is dwindling,” said John Lynch at Comerica Wealth Management. “It is therefore imperative, in our opinion, that corporate profits continue to expand to justify current levels of equity valuation and investor sentiment.”With banks slated to unofficially kick off first-quarter earnings this week, their results will be watched closely to see whether growth can justify an S&P 500 price-earnings ratio that’s roughly 20% above its 10-year average. At 21 times profits, that translates to an earnings yield of 4.8%, a multiple that looks increasingly unfavorable with 10-year Treasury yields rising to 4.5%.Wall Street’s Reaction to CPI Data:That’s the sound of the door slamming shut on a June rate cut.The Fed’s last mile just got longer and bumpier. The Fed may still be able to cut in June, but the narrative is getting increasingly difficult. No matter how you slice the data, it’s hard to argue that inflation is falling. For a central bank that was looking for any sign that inflation was continuing to fall toward its target, this report will be a big disappointment for the Federal Reserve.This inflation release effectively takes June off the table for the first rate cut and should push the odds out further with a coin toss in July or September.This reinforces our view that the market remains too optimistic on rate cuts this year given the underlying strength of the US economy.For the June rate cut optimists, this reading is a bit of blow. Markets have been wrestling with the likelihood of the Federal Reserve delivering on three rate cuts this year, but on these numbers, two rate cuts may now be the more likely outcome.The US economy is running along at quite a pace and a June rate cut looks less and less likely – July or September is the call now. The Fed has got some head scratching to do and if other central banks were waiting for the Fed to move, they have got a conundrum on their hands now.The rates market needs to seriously consider the likelihood of higher-for-longer at minimum lasting through the Summer and potentially through the end of the year. This number did not eclipse the Fed’s confidence, it did, however, cast a shadow on it.This marks the third consecutive strong reading and means that the stalled disinflationary narrative can no longer be called a blip. In fact, even if inflation were to cool next month to a more comfortable reading, there is likely sufficient caution within the Fed now to mean that a July cut may also be a stretch.Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Sagarika Jaisinghani, Alexandra Semenova, Carter Johnson, Felice Maranz, Liz Capo McCormick, Jessica Menton, Carly Wanna, Natalia Kniazhevich, Denitsa Tsekova, Lu Wang and Ryan Vlastelica.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","April 10, 2024 - 23:30"
13,A trade deal with India would give Switzerland ‘a head start’,"Switzerland, together with other members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), is getting closer to signing a free trade agreement with India. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin recently told the media that the final details of an accord are now being worked out.While on a stop in Davos to attend the World Economic Forum in January, Parag Khanna spoke with SWI swissinfo.ch about global migration and the anticipated FTA between India and EFTA.SWI swissinfo.ch: In your 2021 book, Move: Where People are Going for a Better Future, you focus on the massive global human migration taking place because of climate change, demography and conflict. You see the vast uninhabited northern regions of Canada, Northern Europe, Siberia and Central Asia as possible destinations. Considering that migration has been one of the hottest topics in our domestic policy for 50 years, does this mean Switzerland can now sit back and relax?Parag Khanna: When it comes to migration, Switzerland is very self-assured. It has good control of its borders when it comes to third countries [outside Europe] and is very selective. Many of these immigrants come from Asia. They have assimilated well and make an important contribution to the Swiss economy..Megatrends, such as climate change, migration, geopolitical conflicts and civil wars, mean that people from Asia are coming to Europe in greater numbers, as are people from Arab and African countries.Switzerland must, of course, protect its own stability, even when the issue is politically delicate and when it is sometimes accused of not being generous or merciful enough. It is already doing this, through free trade agreements and building close commercial relations with countries that are rich in talent, such as Asian countries.SWI: Given the melting permafrost and the cutting down of forests that the planet needs as its “green lungs”, isn’t your vision of a populated Siberia somewhat adventurous?P.K.: In the book, I wrote that the movement of people from Asia towards the north has already begun. This is not science fiction. Yes, there are barriers such as politics, borders, geographical distances and costs, but a growing number of people from India, Pakistan and other countries have already migrated to Siberia and Central Asia, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.I have been visiting these countries for 30 years. Each time I go there, I see not only the seasonal agricultural workers, but also many Asians working in the building industry and as English teachers, opticians and cooks in canteens and hotels.In 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is certainly no friend of foreigners, made an agreement with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the exchange of certain skilled workers between Russia and India. In fact, more and more people from Asia are travelling to Russian territories. Romania and Greece have also recently made similar agreements with India. The aim is to compensate for labour shortages resulting from demographic imbalances.SWI: How significant is the free trade agreement that Switzerland and the three other EFTA countries [Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein] are now finalising with India?P.K.: Switzerland has done a great job because the free trade agreement is an important foreign economic and diplomatic success. In contrast to the European Union and Britain, Switzerland has taken action. The EU and Britain talked with India and travelled there, but they were not able to reach a free trade agreement.Switzerland now has a head start, which I see as very clever. It is now likely to become a gateway for India to market Indian products, which are getting better and better, throughout Europe.Swiss industry will also profit from this success. The demand for Swiss advanced technology will increase because India will be the next China. But to achieve this, its industrial production processes have to improve dramatically. India can reach this goal by importing advanced technology from Switzerland and Germany.SWI: Has this Swiss foreign economic policy success had any influence in the diplomatic arena? This year, Switzerland is organising a global peace summit on Ukraine and would also like to bring India on board.P.K.: No. There has been cooperation in other areas, but the response to the peace summit was a clear no.SWI: Why such a categorical rejection?P.K.: India has its own foreign policy interests. It has deepened its relationship with Russia and has entered into close cooperation with Putin. As far as energy market policy and the agenda in Asia are concerned, India is pursuing its own strategy.SWI: What possible further cooperation do you see? We recently reported on a world record-breaking exchange between Swiss secondary-school students from the city of Lucerne and their peers from Kerala. Given the distance of 7,500 kilometres, this cannot be seen as a model.P.K.: Student exchanges between universities and technical high schools are always very important. The European Erasmus [education support] programme is a huge success. Compare that with the exchanges between the US and China. Because of tensions between those two countries, the total number of American students studying in China has decreased to around 200.SWI: Russia openly opposes human rights, individual freedoms and democracy. Given India’s close alliance with Russia, is there any sustainable common ground between India and Switzerland?P.K.: Yes, there is. The common ground exists primarily on a functional level, specifically the desire for greater exchange in technology.But when Indian students, teachers and specialists from the technical fields come to Switzerland to learn here, this also leads to stronger personal and family ties. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the common good.That’s how a relationship of trust can develop between the two societies – through exchange, like the one that’s developed between India and the US. I, myself, am an American with Indian roots and a family in India.Edited by Benjamin von Wyl. Adapted from German by Sue Brönnimann/gw","February 18, 2024 - 10:30"
14,Why Swiss chocolate makers can’t win the battle against child labour,"Around 1.56 million children work in cocoa production. That’s the finding of the most comprehensive survey of cocoa growing households (around 90% of cocoa is grown by smallholder farmers) published by the National Opinion Research Centre (NORC) at the University of Chicago in 2020 . In cocoa-growing areas, 38% of children in the Ivory Coast and 55% of children in Ghana living in agricultural households were engaged in child labour in cocoa production.  Zurich-based chocolate-maker Barry Callebaut has committed to cover its entire supply chain by Human Rights Due Diligence by 2025 and remediate all child labour cases identified. Nestlé and Lindt & Sprüngli have also promised to achieve full traceability of their cocoa supply chain to individual farms by 2025. However, researchers from the University of Geneva recently published a white paper analysing the root causes of child labour and conclude that companies cannot succeed on their own.   SWI swissinfo.ch spoke to the authors of the report who gave a joint response. SWI swissinfo.ch: There has been progress in reducing child labour in cocoa plantations but companies seem to have hit a brick wall. For example, one in three children in the Ivory Coast still work on family farms in cocoa-growing areas, compared to over one in two children in 2005. Why has progress stalled in the last decade? Berit Knaak and Dorothée Baumann-Pauly (BK and DBP): The reasons are complex. Never before have chocolate companies been more ready to acknowledge that child labour remains a concern and to commit resources to address the issue. However, interventions from the private sector often cluster around geographic regions that are conveniently accessible. This means they leave other more remote farming communities behind where child labour risks are likely even greater. Also, companies tend to work on their individual supply chains instead of collaborating with industry peers and other key stakeholders to develop a comprehensive strategy for a sustainable solution. Such a company-by-company approach has limitations because it will not address systemic challenges.  In a similar manner, the governments of the Ivory Coast and Ghana often support the work of civil society organisations but rarely work more closely with foreign governments. There appears to be not just a lack of coordination, but also a lack of understanding the interconnectedness of drivers for child labour. Addressing only one aspect without considering the many factors that drive the phenomenon will not yield the desired results of reducing and eventually eliminating child labour. SWI: Monitoring plays a huge role when it comes to tackling the child labour problem in the cocoa sector. How is this possible in remote or cross-border areas with Ghana or Burkina Faso, which are becoming the new frontiers of cocoa cultivation? BK and DBP: Up to one quarter of the Ivorian cocoa production is estimated to be currently non-traceable. New cocoa-growing areas have developed in remote areas in the western regions of the Ivory Coast, which are not easily accessible.  Companies are now required by the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive to apply a risk-based human rights due-diligence approach, meaning they need to focus on parts of their value chain where risks to people are likely to be the most significant. New technologies could facilitate identifying high-risk areas for child labour. Going forward with our research, we plan to look into earth observation satellite and geospatial data to map potential high-risk areas. But this will just be the first step. The data needs to be verified in the field. And still then, addressing child labour requires understanding the complex root causes; only then can a comprehensive and viable remediation strategy be developed. SWI: Is there not a danger that zero tolerance for child labour in cocoa will push children to more hazardous sectors like mining? BK and DBP: Many companies indeed work with zero-tolerance policies for child labour, out of concern that anything else would be misunderstood as accepting child labour. However, addressing child labour requires to some extent a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the realities in cocoa farming communities. A zero-tolerance policy sets incentives to avoid addressing complex root causes and to merely treat the symptoms in order to get quick results. Even worse, companies might give up the sourcing relationship altogether due to their zero-tolerance policy, without starting any attempt to remediate the problem. In this case, zero-tolerance policies can push children into searching employment elsewhere out of economic necessity, for example in the informal sector or other industries (such as artisanal gold mining) that are arguably more dangerous. SWI: You’ve advocated in your recent study to move away from individual root causes of child labour toward interconnected causes. Can you explain what this means with an example? BK and DBP: Our research
External link
shows that child labour is never the result of just one root cause but of an ecosystem that makes it more likely. Addressing the issue therefore also requires working on multiple interconnected root causes.  For example, providing access to education requires providing the physical infrastructure (a weather-appropriate building, furniture, and teaching material), finding and financing (and possibly housing) a qualified teacher, and arranging transportation to school – all of these tasks arguably require the competence of different stakeholders.  Even if education is available, it is only accessible if children have a birth certificate, which comes with its own set of challenging administrative requirements. Another example is common health issues in cocoa farming communities, such as malaria or diseases due to the lack of clean drinking water. If farm workers are unable to work, it is often their children who step in. Mitigating this risk involves dealing with the accessibility, affordability, and quality of health care.  SWI: Countries like the Ivory Coast and Ghana earn millions of dollars from exporting cocoa beans to places like Switzerland. Shouldn’t their governments and cocoa boards also shoulder the responsibility of tackling child labour? BK and DBP: Shared responsibility implies that all stakeholders work together on a strategy that can effectively address the child labour problem, and that includes government actors too. Governments in producer countries have a key role in preparing an ecosystem that enables children to, for example, access education by facilitating the provision of birth registrations, by training teachers, and by defining school curricula.  SWI: Switzerland has been a member of the International Cocoa Agreement since 1972. This aims to promote exchange and cooperation between consumer and producer countries. What can the Swiss government do to tackle child labour in one of its most strategic industries?  BK and DBP: Effective since January 1, 2022, the Swiss Ordinance on business and human rights (DDTrO) explicitly outlines the expectations for companies that operate in supply chains that are at risk of involving child labour. Swiss companies that do business with high risks of child labour – such as companies in the cocoa sector – are required to conduct full human rights due diligence, which means that they must establish supply-chain traceability and define steps to identify, mitigate and remediate child labour. The first reports for companies under this new legislation are due in 2024 (covering 2023) and if companies fail to report or provide false information, they can be fined up to CHF100,000 ($113,235).   Beyond legislation, the Swiss government could advance the elimination of child labour by working directly with the governments in the two main cocoa-producing countries, Ghana and the Ivory Coast. They could use their collective convening power to bring together the key stakeholders in the cocoa industry and help to set up and coordinate landscape approaches, which address child labor holistically in high-risk regions.  Switzerland, like no other country in the world, represents the chocolate industry and the Swiss government should lead innovative efforts to address child labour in the cocoa supply chain.

15,Explainer-What is the UNGA and what will world leaders talk about?,"By Michelle NicholsUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -Every September world leaders travel to New York to address the start of the annual United Nations General Assembly session.The six days of speeches to mark the beginning of the 79th session will start Tuesday. WHO SPEAKS WHEN? When the United Nations was formed in 1945 following World War Two, there were originally 51 members. That has since grown to 193 members. Leaders of two non-member observer states – known at the U.N. as the Holy See and the State of Palestine – and an observer member, the European Union, can also speak.It is tradition for Brazil to always be the first member state to speak. This is because in the early years of the world body Brazil stepped up to speak first when other countries were reluctant to do so, say U.N. officials. As host to the U.N. headquarters in New York, the United States is the second country to address the General Assembly.From there the list is then based on hierarchy and generally a first come, first served basis. Heads of state speak first, followed by deputy heads of state and crown princes, heads of government, ministers, and lower-ranked heads of a delegation.This year some 87 heads of state, three vice-presidents, two crown princes, 45 heads of government, eight deputy heads of government, 45 ministers, and four lower-ranked heads of a delegation are currently due to address the General Assembly.Last year fewer than 12% of those to stand at the lectern were women. HOW LONG WILL THEY SPEAK? Leaders are asked to stick to a voluntary 15-minute time limit. According to U.N. records, one of the longest speeches made during the opening of a General Assembly was by Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 1960 – he spoke for about four and a half hours. More recently, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi spoke for more than one and a half hours in 2009. WHAT WILL THEY TALK ABOUT?Each high-level gathering to mark the start of the annual General Assembly session has a theme, which leaders tend to briefly reference before moving on to talking about whatever they want. This year’s theme is: “Leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.”Some other topics likely to be spoken about by leaders include: THE WAR IN GAZAWith the death toll in Gaza ballooning to more than 41,000 people, according to local health officials, and the humanitarian situation deteriorating, many leaders are expected to call for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas. The conflict started nearly a year ago with the deadly Hamas attack on civilians in Israel on Oct. 7 – two weeks after world leaders had finished meeting at the last U.N. General Assembly.After Israel began retaliating against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the General Assembly on Oct. 27 called for an immediate humanitarian truce. It then overwhelming demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in December.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – who has long accused the U.N. of being anti-Israel – and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are both scheduled to address the General Assembly on Sept. 26. UKRAINEMany world leaders are likely to call for an end to Russia’s roughly two-and-a-half year war in Ukraine. The General Assembly adopted six resolutions on the conflict in the first year – denouncing Moscow and demanding it withdraw all its troops. A resolution in October 2022 – condemning Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four regions in Ukraine – won the greatest support with 143 states voting yes.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to address the General Assembly on Wednesday. While Russian President Vladimir Putin virtually addressed the General Assembly in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, he has not physically travelled to New York for the event since 2015. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is instead due to speak to the General Assembly on Sept. 28.CLIMATEAs the world struggles to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, leaders of smaller island nations and other states most affected by climate changes are likely to use their speeches at the General Assembly to again make impassioned pleas for action.UN SECURITY COUNCIL REFORM Many world leaders – particularly from Africa and key powers including Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan – are likely to call for reform of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security.  It is an issue that has long been discussed by the General Assembly, but has gathered steam in recent years after Russia invaded Ukraine and then used its Security Council veto to block any action by the body. The United States has also long been criticized for shielding its ally Israel from council action. Reform ideas include expanding the council’s membership – through adding more permanent veto powers or short-term elected members – to better reflect the world and limiting the veto, currently held by the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.Any changes to the Security Council membership is done by amending the founding U.N. Charter. This needs the approval and ratification by two-thirds of the General Assembly, including the Security Council’s current five veto powers. SUMMIT OF THE FUTURE Before the leaders begin addressing the General Assembly, a two-day Summit of the Future will be held on Sept. 22-23. U.N. member states are currently negotiating three documents they hope to adopt on Sept. 22 – a pact for the future, a declaration on future generations and a global digital compact.Speaking to Reuters, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it was “absolutely essential” to ambitiously use the summit to come up with “adequate governance for the world of today.”He argued for reform of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for global governance of artificial intelligence and other emerging challenges.(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Deepa Babington)","September 19, 2024 - 15:46"
16,Killings hit record high in 2021 as post-lockdown stress grew – UN,"By Francois MurphyVIENNA (Reuters) – The number of murders and other intentional killings surged to a record high across the world in 2021, driven in part by the stress and economic pressures of COVID-19 lockdowns, a U.N. report said on Friday.Around 458,000 people were killed intentionally, higher than the 400,000 to 450,000 recorded every year since researchers started collating the data in 2000, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Global Study on Homicide said.Escalations in gang or political violence in Ecuador, Myanmar and other countries played their part, the study said.But the after-effects of lockdowns, where people were cooped up inside for long periods, also took their toll.“The noticeable spike in killings in 2021 can be attributed in part to the economic repercussions of COVID-related restrictions,” the report said.Initially, the lockdowns that rolled out across the world from 2020 may have reduced the number of murders, as potential killers largely stayed inside and only mixed with people in the same household, the study said.But “in the longer term, the negative social and economic repercussions of lockdowns, which may include increased stress and anxiety, unemployment or loss of income, can be expected to affect homicide trends by creating an environment of ‘strain’ that drives individuals to commit crime,” the report said.In Colombia, strict lockdown measures imposed in March 2020 led to a sharp but short-lived drop in homicides, the researchers found. That was followed by a surge in 2021.AMERICAS HAD HIGHEST HOMICIDE RATEOverall, countries in the Americas continued to have the highest homicide rate of the five global regions – more than six times Europe’s, which was the lowest.In 2021, eight of the 10 countries with the highest homicide rates were in Latin America and the Caribbean, the report said, citing factors such as crime groups competing for control of markets, weak rule of law and social inequality.Honduras, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Mexico were among those with the highest homicide rates. The two in the top 10 outside Latin America and the Caribbean were Myanmar and South Africa.In Ecuador, the government blamed a surge of killings on drug gangs that use the country as a transit point en route to the United States and Europe.In Myanmar, after overthrowing Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government in February 2021, Myanmar’s military junta met sustained resistance in the countryside from militias allied with that government. A 2022 U.N. report said troops had carried out mass killings and targeted civilians.Myanmar’s military said it had a duty to ensure peace and security. It denied atrocities had taken place and blamed “terrorists” for causing unrest.The UNODC homicide study, published every four to five years, analysed developments up to 2021 as that was the latest year with a full set of data.The study said it looked at killings of one person by another that were intentional and unlawful.“Death as a result of terrorist activities” was included despite the lack of an international definition of terrorism, and most conflict deaths were excluded, though “it is often difficult to disentangle” the types of killing in conflict situations that should be included and those that should not, the study said.(Editing by Andrew Heavens)","December 8, 2023 - 15:00"
17,"Analysis-Despite COP28 deal on fossil fuels, 1.5C goal likely out of reach","By Gloria DickieDUBAI (Reuters) – A deal for the world to transition away from fossil fuels was hailed as a historic achievement on Wednesday at the U.N. climate summit in Dubai, but there’s a good chance it won’t achieve its ultimate goal – holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.For months, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber had described that 1.5C limit – first stated in the 2015 Paris Agreement – as his “North Star” or guiding principle for the summit.Scientists say that a global temperature rise beyond 1.5C above the preindustrial average will trigger catastrophic and irreversible impacts, from melting ice sheets to the collapse of ocean currents.But year after year, that target slips further away – with the world’s planet-warming emissions still rising, and temperatures hitting new heights.This year will be the hottest ever on record, with the global average for 2023 a sweltering 1.46C above preindustrial levels.In terms of global warming, which is measured in terms of decades, the world has experienced nearly 1.2C (2.2F) of warming.The deal made in Dubai, called the UAE Consensus, would see the world commit to transitioning away from “fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner … so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science.”But scientists said that, while the pact was unprecedented, it still wasn’t enough for that outcome to be realized.“It’s a landmark result because it’s the first time we’ve said we’re going to reduce fossil fuel use,” said James Dyke, an earth systems scientist at the University of Exeter in Britain.“But you can forget about 1.5C.”TOO LITTLE, TOO LATEThe U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the main scientific body which informs the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, has said that limiting warming to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot would require rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Specifically, the world needs to cut its emissions from 2019 levels by as much as 43% in the next six years, 60% by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050 in order to prevent compounding impacts, such as thawing permafrost which releases long-trapped greenhouse gases, triggering even more warming.The IPCC declined to comment on the outcome of COP28.The world posted record high greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, rising 1.2% above 2021, according to the 2023 U.N. Emissions Gap Report.The UAE Consensus does not commit the world to phasing out oil and gas, nor to near-term timelines for transitioning away from fossil fuels.“It’s like promising your doctor that you will ‘transition away from donuts’ after being diagnosed with diabetes,” said climate scientist Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania.If countries are to have even a 50-50 chance of limiting warming to 1.5C, they can emit only another 250 billion metric tons or so of carbon dioxide. At current emissions levels, that will be met in just six years, according to an October 2023 study in the journal Nature Climate Change.“This mandate is still not even close to what’s needed to accomplish the goals we agreed on in Paris in 2015,” said climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University.This is true for high-emitting developed countries who also haven’t committed to greater support for developing countries in the energy transition, she said.The UAE Consensus also calls on countries to accelerate new technologies, which could include “abatement and removal technologies such as carbon capture and utilization and storage” (CCUS).This means the world could continue using coal, oil and gas, provided they can capture those emissions. Critics say the technology remains expensive and unproven at scale, and worry that it will now be used to justify continued drilling.“Sultan Al-Jaber and everybody else … they are committing to an overshoot scenario,” Dyke said. “The plan is we’re going to exceed 1.5C quite significantly, and then it’s going to be the deployment of CCUS over the rest of the century to drag temperatures back down.”That’s not necessarily the fault of COP28 alone, scientists said. The 1.5C goal was dead on arrival already in Paris in 2015, without the summit producing a clear plan back then to rapidly rein in fossil fuel use right away, they said.WHERE’S THE BEEF?Despite the COP28 Presidency’s efforts to highlight food security as a pressing threat, the UAE Consensus does not attempt to tackle the sizeable emissions that come from agriculture and waste.Farmlands, livestock and landfills account for one-third of the world’s planet-warming emissions.But they’re also harder to bring down, with limited solutions on offer.“Even if fossil fuels were phased out, if you don’t tackle food systems, it’s impossible to reach 1.5C,” said agricultural scientist Emile Frison of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems.The COP28 talks also saw a raft of new voluntary commitments, ranging from tripling renewables to reining in methane emissions from oil and gas operations.An assessment by the International Energy Agency found that, even if those results were fully delivered, it would only close about one-third of the emissions gap to limit warming to 1.5C.(Reporting by Gloria Dickie; Editing by Katy Daigle and David Evans)","December 14, 2023 - 13:49"
18,UBS Analyst Who Took On Evergrande Now Bullish on China Property,"(Bloomberg) — When it comes to Chinese real estate, John Lam is a lone wolf. The UBS analyst shocked markets three years ago with a rare sell rating on China Evergrande Group, 11 months before it defaulted and became the poster child for the property collapse. Now Lam is going against the grain again, forecasting a gradual recovery in a moribund market that most analysts say hasn’t hit bottom.“After three years of being bearish, we’re turning more positive on the China property sector for the first time due to government aid,” Lam, the head of China and Hong Kong property research at UBS Group AG, said in an interview in Hong Kong. Lam predicts home demand and supply will return to historical averages sometime next year, and developers with sizable portfolios in 21 major cities will likely see their stocks rebound. He upgraded several companies, including Longfor Group Holdings Ltd., to buy in January.And just as he did on Evergrande in 2021, Lam is combining a deep data dive with his own gut feeling to make the unconventional bet on China’s housing sector. “It was from instinct that something was just not right,” said Lam, 38, recalling his brief, 10-line report on Evergrande that raised alarm bells about the meltdown that would follow. Much like his Evergrande call, the rebound bet is a gutsy one. Home sales tanked and prices plunged in March at an even faster annual pace than the previous month, extending a three-year decline. Bloomberg Economics expects the sector to account for just 16% of China’s economy by 2026, from a peak of 24% before the slump. Some five million jobs will be lost or curtailed along the way, BI says.Yet Lam was proven right on Evergrande, downgrading the stock just as the high-flying developer was riding a boom in Chinese real estate. At the time, Evergrande had a market value of about $47 billion, making founder Hui Ka Yan one of the richest men in Asia.As far back as 2017, some fuzzy math caught Lam’s attention: Chinese developers were voraciously snapping up plots of land to build houses, but their leverage remained broadly unchanged. That led him to dig into the data, shining a light on the murky corner of off-balance sheet debt that was fueling the expansion. Groundwork for the research was done by UBS’s Evidence Lab, a global team of more than 300 people specializing in building independent datasets from scratch. In China’s property space, that ranged from scraping two decades of housing launch data to taking the pulse of sales at 1,200 shopping malls.For Lam, a long-distance runner who has completed half-marathons, it was a long slog, poring over about 10,000 residential projects owned by the major developers he covers. His conclusion: the gearing — or debt to equity ratio —  of Chinese builders was on average 170% as of June 2019, compared with a reported 108%. Cash-StrappedThat meant that China’s developers would be cash-strapped as their massive refinancing needs peaked over the next two years, Lam cautioned. Evergrande was one of the riskiest, with its short-term debt to cash and net gearing among the five worst, Lam noted.That led to his downgrade in January 2021, making him the only analyst among 19 covering Evergrande to slap a sell rating on the firm and cut the target below the share price. He reduced his target to HK$6, compared with the HK$14.50 price at the time. The report caused a stir. Evergrande said in a written response that the UBS estimate had “no factual basis,” and that the company was confident it would reach its 2021 sales target. Lam’s note also drew ire from investors. Many ignored his call, while some ridiculed him as the shares moved higher in the following days. One global asset manager said: “stock is up, means no one listens to his calls.”Lam’s concerns were quickly borne out of course. Evergrande’s shares tumbled more than 90% before trading was suspended 14 months later. The company defaulted on its debt and the crisis soon spread to other firms. In all, developers have defaulted on more than $122 billion in bonds since the saga began.Now, after years of pain, the sector is poised for a slow recovery, says Lam, a graduate of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who previously worked for Morgan Stanley.While he doesn’t expect sales and prices to rise this year, the declines will ease. Residential sales will likely drop 7% by area, he says, down from a record 27% tumble in 2022. New starts are likely to fall 7%, narrowing from a 39% slide in 2022. Prices may slip 10% in tier-1 and tier-2 cities.“Once prices stabilize, we think pent-up demand will come back due to the three-year property price down cycle that has led people to delay their purchases,” Lam said in a separate email.Ironically, the key to recovery lies in the record number of defaults, according to Lam. Since most private firms have lost access to funding, many have stopped buying land and building homes, reducing oversupply. New housing starts by Chinese developers have tumbled 58% amid the slump, much more than the 37% drop in real estate sales by area. This “destocking” could bring housing inventory down to a more typical level of 24 months by January, in a bull case scenario, or next December in the bear case, Lam says.Other economists and analysts are less sanguine. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says the market has still not hit bottom. Bloomberg Intelligence agreed:China’s housing correction is far from over. That reflects weaker readings on housing indicators despite incremental policy support. Tumbling housing sales are squeezing the developers’ finances, keeping default risks elevated. The sustained property slump will continue to hobble the economy in 2024.Indeed, it took Japan about 15 years to bottom out from an epic housing bust in the early 1990s, and the US needed about six years to recover after the sub-prime mortgage crisis. China’s home price drop of almost 20% from peaks is a far cry from a 70% decline seen in Hong Kong after its 1997 housing bust. Lam says China’s property market is healthier than Japan and Hong Kong during their crises, citing the lower urbanization rate and household leverage, along with strict foreign exchange controls. These combine to empower the Chinese government to manage its property bubble better than Japan did, he said.

A campaign of redeveloping so-called ‘chengzhongcun,’ literally “villages in the middle of the city,” is quietly unfolding in 21 mega cities. A sudden jump in low-cost funds that the central bank injected into lenders late last year suggest the push is real, and more cash support could be on the way, Lam said.“We should expect stabilization in property prices and new starts,” by June 2025, Lam said.  “Right now, the biggest debate is the macro question of how homebuyer demand can recover.” To do that, more support is needed. Lam estimates that China’s delayed and suspended residential projects amount to about 7 million units as of March. The required money is about 2 trillion yuan ($276 billion). “So far the funding coming from the government is probably not enough,” he said.When it comes to differentiating future winners and losers, Lam looks at which developers shift their business model to have more commercial property exposure, which generates more recurring rental income and shields a developer from a cyclical drop of housing demand. Another key sign is which developers are still acquiring land, as this determines earnings outlook three or four years later, Lam said. “Land acquisition also tells investors indirectly whether they have access to funding,” said Lam. “Usually when the developer slows down land acquisition, that’s not a good sign.” (Updates with analyst’s further sector outlook in the last four paragraphs)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","April 25, 2024 - 04:24"
19,The chocolate of the future will have less cocoa or none at all  ,"The Swiss chocolate industry is under a lot of pressure. Cocoa prices have reached record highs, recently surpassing $10,000 (CHF9,150) per tonne for the first time. Poor weather and disease in Ivory Coast and Ghana have led to a deficit in cocoa beans for the third year in a row. The two West African countries account for about 60% of global cocoa production.   “Compared to the average prices recorded a year ago ($2,752 per tonne in London and $3,040 per tonne in New York), the average prices seen in April 2024 represented significant increases of 301% and 244% respectively,” said the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) in its market review for April. To add more pressure, the European Union has introduced a “zero deforestation” supply chain regulation which will come into force in January 2025. Seven agricultural commodities, including cocoa and cocoa products such as chocolate, cannot be sold in the EU unless it can be proven that they have not caused deforestation since 2020. Germany alone accounted for 21.7% of Swiss chocolate exports in 2023 with around 40% of all Swiss chocolate exports ending up in the shopping baskets of EU citizens. “Time is of the essence: without a solution by the end of the year, access to the EU market will become massively more difficult,” said Chocosuisse in a press release in February. The Association of Swiss Chocolate Manufacturers was responding to the Swiss government’s decision to not introduce similar regulations in Switzerland but instead assess the regulatory impact on Swiss companies after the summer break.  Cocoa cultivation also presents other problems such as child labour and presence of heavy metals such as cadmium.  It is this challenging environment that is fuelling the search for new ingredients that can replace or minimise the use of cocoa in chocolate but are cultivated in Europe. UK based company Nukoko

is one such start-up that is making the most of this trend. It managed to raise $1.5 million in seed funding this year to scale up its cocoa-free chocolate made from fava beans.  “Nukoko are investing in this area as there is a critical need for alternatives now and into the future, as we have seen by the current cocoa price increases, caused by a supply deficit generated from climate change. The market needs alternatives that are derived from different areas that are not affected by climate change, thus giving a cheaper and more sustainable long-term option,” Ross Newton, founder and co-CEO of Nukoko, told SWI swissinfo.ch by email.  Nukoko sources the beans from the UK, which harvests 740,000 tonnes annually. Like cocoa beans, fava beans also contain a protein called vicilin that gives a chocolate-like flavour when broken down by fermentation and roasting.  German company ChoViva

is another European start-up that is using fermentation and roasting to produce high-quality chocolate. Instead of beans, the raw materials used are oats and sunflower seeds. “We have studied the history and production of chocolate in depth and discovered that the typical taste does not come from the cocoa bean alone. Rather, up to 80% of the flavours are formed during production processes such as fermentation and roasting,” says the company’s website. Another raw material with potential to replace cocoa is carob, a legume grown in southern Europe. Italian startup Foreverland

has created a range of chocolate with carob as the main ingredient. The company claims that its Freecao product uses 90% less water and produces 80% less CO2 emissions than conventional chocolate.  The next frontline in innovation is using chocolate as a proactive means to benefit society and the environment. Researchers from the federal technology institute ETH Zurich have developed a cocoa gel

made from the cocoa fruit that replaces the added sugar in chocolate. This would allow cocoa farmers to use most of the cocoa fruit, which only leaves the shell that can be used for composting or as fuel. Consumers will also benefit as chocolate made from this cocoa gel has 20% more fibre and 30% less saturated fat than conventional dark chocolate.

at Harvard University, which is funded by Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, goes even further. Researchers there have come up with a technology that converts greenhouse gases such as CO2 into a fat that mimics cocoa butter using just microbes and electricity. The gas fermentation technology, commercialised by spinoff company Circe Bioscience, has raised more than $8 million from investors to develop the world’s first chocolate made with fermentation-derived cocoa butter. However, these technologies are still in their infancy and the chocolate of the future is not going to be radically different to what consumers are used to.  “I like to think for the consumer the future of chocolate in general terms will be the same, as in the same brands they love offering them the same delicious products that they have always enjoyed at an agreeable price point,” says Newton. “What may change is that the chocolate that is in or around these products will be made up in part or in whole from different sources, such as fava beans in our case.” Edited by Marc Leutenegger/ts","May 24, 2024 - 16:33"
20,"US, China top military officials speak for first time in over a year","By Phil Stewart and Doina ChiacuWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The top U.S. military officer held a virtual meeting with his Chinese counterpart on Thursday, the Pentagon said, in the first such conversation in over a year amid hopes by U.S. officials that it could lead to a broader restoration of ties between the two militaries.The video teleconference followed an agreement between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month to resume military-to-military ties severed by Beijing after then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited self-ruled Taiwan in August 2022.U.S. Air Force General Charles Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Liu Zhenli of China’s People’s Liberation Army touched on “a number of global and regional security issues,” Brown’s office said.Liu is the chief of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the military body responsible for China’s combat operations and planning.Pentagon officials say communication between the two militaries is crucial to preventing a miscalculation from spiraling into conflict.“Gen. Brown discussed the importance of working together to responsibly manage competition, avoid miscalculations, and maintain open and direct lines of communication,” Brown’s office said.“Gen. Brown reiterated the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue to reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings.”Brown said last month he had sent an introductory letter to Liu saying he was open to meeting.Liu said the key for U.S. and China to develop a healthy, stable and sustainable military-to-military relationship is for the U.S. to have a “correct understanding of China”, according to a Chinese defence ministry statement late Thursday.U.S. officials have cautioned that even with some restoration of military communications, forging truly functional dialogue between the two sides could take time.Some analysts say China seeks ambiguity in defence relations to constrain what Beijing sees as U.S. military provocations in the region.Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads over everything from the future of democratically ruled Taiwan to territorial claims in the South China Sea. Diplomatic relations are still recovering after the U.S. downed an alleged Chinese spy balloon in February.On the Taiwan issue, which China deems internal affairs, Liu said Chinese armed forces will resolutely defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity over it.Liu also asked for the U.S. to respect China’s territorial sovereignty, and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea.“Be prudent in words and actions, and take concrete actions to safeguard regional peace and stability and the overall situation of China-U.S. relations,” he said.Liu has emerged as the top contender to replace China’s national defence minister, General Li Shangfu, who was dismissed from his position last month. Reuters reported in September that Li was under investigation over suspected corruption related to equipment procurement and development.In Tokyo last month, Brown acknowledged corruption in the Chinese military when asked about Li’s removal, and broader issues in the PLA, but also noted “alignment with Xi Jinping and his thinking as he continues to consolidate power”.Li was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 for an arms deal he secured with Russia in an earlier role. China had demanded that the sanctions – which included a visa ban and prohibitions on conducting U.S. financial transactions – be lifted.Liu, 59, is not under Western sanctions.(Reporting by Doina Chiacu, and Liz Lee in Beijing; editing by Susan Heavey, Bernadette Baum and Leslie Adler)","December 22, 2023 - 01:49"
21,CRISPR: Is Switzerland ready to embrace gene editing in agriculture?,"Just a stone’s throw from a sleepy suburban neighbourhood outside Zurich, barley is being grown under high security. Because this is no ordinary barley – it’s a gene-edited variety that’s pitting science and the need to boost food production against opponents of genetically engineered crops.The Golden Promise variety is the star of the first ever field trial in Switzerland of a crop whose genes have been edited using CRISPR/Cas9 “genetic scissors” technology. The technique, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
External link
in 2020 for the two scientists who discovered it, allows breeders to delete, add or replace specific genetic information in a plant that’s linked to certain desirable or undesirable traits.For example, scientists can identify a sequence in a crop’s DNA that makes it susceptible to a particular disease. Using this information, they can create a special RNA (single stranded messengers that carry instructions between DNA and the cellular machinery to make proteins) that can locate this sequence and then attach a DNA-cutting enzyme to it to deactivate the gene that makes the plant vulnerable to that disease.Using such genetic scissors technology allows more precise manipulation of traits than is possible under conventional plant breeding. It is also quicker: removing an undesirable trait such as disease vulnerability or adding a desirable trait such as drought resistance can be achieved in just a couple of years rather than a decade. In the case of the Swiss barley trial, the goal is to disable the CKX2 gene that regulates seed formation using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Japanese researchers have already used this process successfully to increase the yield of rice. Scientists from the Swiss agricultural institute Agroscope, in partnership with the Freie Universität Berlin, are hoping for the same results with barley.“Compared to conventional breeding you can be very, very precise with this method,” says Roland Peter, head of Agroscope’s Plant Breeding Strategic Research Division. “While we can also induce mutation with currently available plant breeding tools, it is just random. You cannot steer it and here we can, of course, steer it and just affect one gene instead of thousands.”The barley trial is being closely monitored and not just by scientific eyeballs – the field is protected by an electrified fence and patrolled by a security guard and a sleek Malinois guard dog. The site has existed since 2014 after the Swiss parliament decided the previous year to fund such a facility, and was set up in response to the vandalism of the majority of field plots of a trial of genetically modified wheat in 2008 on the same site.Swiss regulations treat the trial in the same way as they would a genetically modified crop, even though they are technically not the same. Unlike genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the barley grown here does not contain genes from another species. Whatever traits are introduced via CRISPR technology could theoretically develop in nature, but on a far longer time scale. However, regulation has not yet caught up with the scientific advances.“We have quite an old gene technology law here in Europe and in Switzerland and this is not adapted for the kind of changes you can make with these genome editing methods. Differentiation [between genome editing and transgenic modification] is really missing here at the moment,” says Peter.This means that as with genetically modified crops, researchers have to seek approval from the Federal Office for the Environment, a process that can take six months if there are no objections. In addition, containment measures are necessary to ensure that accidental release outside the experimental field does not happen.The Swiss government’s reluctance to open the genetic engineering floodgates stems from the country’s opposition to genetically modified food. A moratorium was slapped on GMOs following a nationwide vote in 2005 that only allowed exceptions for research. The freeze has been extended several times since then and is currently in force until 2025.However, in March 2023, the Swiss parliament asked the government to prepare a draft act for consultation with the aim of introducing a risk-based approval system for plants and seeds developed using CRISPR technology. This will give an exemption to the GMO ban, permitting trials of plants that have been subjected to genetic engineering techniques, that do not contain foreign genes and that offer added value for agriculture, the environment and consumers. The draft act is expected to be presented by the government for consultation in the second half of the year, most likely in September.Among those likely to participate in the consultation process is the Swiss-based Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), one of the world’s leading institutes in organic agriculture. The organisation is concerned about the potential impact of gene editing on organic farming and is putting together its own official position on the issue.“We see the potential of gene editing to help to reduce the application of synthetic pesticides in the short term for conventional agriculture,” says Monika Messmer, co-Group Lead of Plant Breeding at FiBL. “However, we are afraid that the overpromising of such fast technical fixes bears the great risk that the important and urgently needed transformation towards more sustainable agricultural and food systems will be further postponed.”There is also disagreement over the claim made by its proponents that gene editing is safe because it produces mutations that are identical to what occurs in nature. Messmer says that modifications are based on genetic engineering, which technically interferes below the cell level and is not a natural process.One company that would like to see Switzerland catch up is agriculture multinational Syngenta. The Swiss-based company, which was bought by Chinese state-owned group ChemChina in 2017, is applying gene editing to its own hybrid varieties with a focus on row crops such as maize and soybean.“Genome editing is easier, faster and cheaper than previous genetic modification efforts,” a spokesperson told SWI swissinfo.ch by email. “Syngenta’s proprietary HI-Edit process, for example, allows breeders to modify crops at various stages in the seeds research and development process. This is important as it allows existing breeding programs to respond to changing climate and pest pressures on a shorter timescale.”In June, Syngenta announced that it was sharing for free the rights to its gene-editing and breeding technologies with academia to boost agricultural innovation, adding to the toolbox available to plant breeders.“Genome editing is the modern alternative to cross-breeding plants in a way that ordering a meal from Uber Eats is the modern alternative to going out to a restaurant,” the spokesperson said. “The traditional ways are still effective at getting your end result (breeding plants or filling your belly), but new, technology-driven options make these processes easier and more convenient.”Messmer from FiBL is worried that consumers will not be able to decide whether they prefer the equivalent of Uber Eats or a restaurant meal and that the process of producing food will take a backseat to the safety of the product itself.“The certification process provides assurance that the apple that’s labelled organic in the shop has followed organic principles in its production and processing as regulated by Switzerland and the European Union,” she says. “Therefore, it is important for farmers and consumers that the breeding process is made transparent and the products are labelled accordingly along the value chain. Only this allows farmers and consumers to make an informed choice of seed and food.”Edited by Nerys Avery/ts","August 9, 2024 - 09:00"
22,Swiss insurer Baloise increases profit and announces job cuts,"+ Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inboxBaloise increased its consolidated profit by 7.6% to CHF219.1 million in the months from January to June, it announced on Thursday.The reasons for the increase were higher profit contributions from Germany and Belgium. Its life insurance business increased operating profit (EBIT) by 40% to CHF145.5 million.In contrast, EBIT in non-life insurance fell by more than a fifth to CHF123.2 million. The early summer storms in various parts of Switzerland had an above-average impact of around CHF80 million net on the results and led to a deterioration in the combined ratio in this segment by 3.1% to 90.4%.If this value is below 100%, the business is operationally profitable.Meanwhile, the insurance group’s business volume fell slightly by 0.9% to CHF5.29 billion, although this would have resulted in an increase of 0.3% in local currencies.The non-life segment grew by 4.6% on an adjusted basis, also thanks to tariff increases, while the volume in the life business fell by just under 5%. The growth of semi-autonomous solutions in occupational pensions is only partially reflected in the premium development.Looking ahead – and probably also as a result of increasing pressure from shareholders – Baloise has reviewed its strategy and set itself new targets for the years 2024 to 2027 under new CEO Michael Müller.The Group describes the new direction as a refocusing strategy. The aim is to build on existing strengths and increase profitability, according to the press release.According to the statement, the new financial targets include a return on equity of 12 to 15%, strong cash generation of over CHF2 billion and a higher cash payout ratio of 80% or more. Cash of over CHF500 million is to be generated in the current year as the basis for a continued “attractive” dividend policy. In addition, a share buyback will probably be launched next spring.Pressure on Baloise from shareholders has recently increased. The activist investor Cevian now plays an important role in the shareholder base with a stake of 9.4%. And at the Annual General Meeting at the end of April, zCapital celebrated a surprising success with its motion to lift the 2% voting rights restriction.In operational terms, Baloise is still aiming for a combined ratio of 90% in the non-life business in an average interest rate and claims environment, although new accounting standards are having a negative impact on this ratio.Meanwhile, the life business is expected to make a sustainable EBIT contribution of at least CHF200 million. These targets already applied previously.All in all, the insurer wants to increase cost discipline and achieve “sustainable profitable growth” in the target segments above the respective market growth. To this end, 250 jobs will also be cut.However, there is no question of withdrawing from a market. According to the press release, Baloise wants to be one of the leading insurers in its attractive target segments in Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg.The last few years have been characterised by change, including to the management bodies of Baloise, according to Thomas von Planta, Chairman of the Board of Directors. “We are convinced that the refocusing strategy will put the company on a promising path to success.”Translated from German by DeepL/mga","September 12, 2024 - 13:48"
23,"China’s push for greener aluminium hit by erratic rains, power cuts","BEIJING (Reuters) – Erratic rainfall in China’s southwest is frustrating a multibillion-dollar push to green an aluminium industry that accounts for almost 60% of global output and, by some estimates, emits more carbon dioxide than Australia.Lured by official promises of cheap hydropower, China Hongqiao Group and a handful of other coal-reliant smelters several years ago began moving 6.56 million metric tons of capacity – about 15% of China’s total – from the northern rust belt to the mountainous and ethnically diverse Yunnan province, known for tea, coffee and wild mushrooms.The opportunity to cut electricity bills and help the world’s top polluter tackle global warming seemed like a safe bet. But as Yunnan’s rivers and reservoirs dwindled amid poor rainfall, which some experts attribute to climate change, so did the reliability of electricity.Reuters interviews with almost two dozen industry figures and analysts, as well as company filings and official documents, found insufficient hydropower has meant that only a little over half of the planned aluminium capacity shift has materialised. Some smelters are slowing or scaling back their already-delayed plans and others are seeking alternative locations.“The power cuts in the past two years have made it clear that Yunnan can’t be sustained as a major producing region,” said one Yunnan industry figure who, as with others, spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the issue’s sensitivity.Despite growing demand for low-carbon products and strong industry profits in recent years, eight employees at four Yunnan smelters said they have had to cut production by 10% to 40%.Muyi Yang, an adjunct fellow at the University of Technology Sydney who researches energy policy, said any supply disruptions would delay China’s broader energy transition because aluminium is used in many clean technologies.In addition to hindering China’s climate goals, the hydro crunch has caused volatility in global aluminium prices and imperilled the potential for producers to cash in on demand for “green” metal, according to the analysts and industry sources.Hongqiao’s plan to move almost 4 million tons of production from Shandong province to Yunnan involved building two plants near the Vietnam border, in Wenshan and Honghe prefectures, each with capacity of roughly 2 million tons.The 17 billion yuan ($2.35 billion) Wenshan factory opened in 2020 and was intended to reach full capacity in August 2022, the director of the industrial park where it is located told state media in 2021. But unstable hydropower has prevented that, two industry figures said.At Honghe, production was due to begin in March 2023, according to a December 2021 overview of projects published by the Yunnan Department of Industry and Information Technology. Yet, initial production capacity of just 500,000 tons will be ready in the middle of this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Chen Xinlin, a senior metals and mining consultant at Wood Mackenzie, said Honghe’s capacity may not be commissioned this year due to the “hydropower bottleneck”.Hongqiao and its parent, Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group, did not respond to Reuters questions about the matter, and the Yunnan government declined to comment.China’s environment and industry ministries, and the top planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), did not respond to requests for comment.GREEN DREAMSAluminium accounts for about 3% of the world’s direct industrial carbon dioxide, according to the International Energy Agency.For China, that meant cleaning up the sector would be crucial to its goals, formalised in 2020, of ensuring the country’s carbon emissions peak by the end of this decade and reach net zero by 2060.Part of the allure of aluminium made from hydropower or other clean energy is that producers may be able to charge premiums as global manufacturers raise their carbon standards for materials, though only a tiny proportion of green aluminium currently attracts such a premium.Besides Hongqiao, producers including industry leader Aluminium Corporation of China, known as Chinalco, were drawn to Yunnan by provincial authorities’ offer of discounted greener power at 0.25 yuan per kilowatt hour (kWh), less than half of what they were paying in northern China. Chinalco announced in 2018 that it would move 1.2 million tons to Yunnan, and suppliers including anode producer Sunstone Development followed. Neither responded to requests for comment.The new smelters brought in staff from China’s north, with factory canteens serving braised noodles and shaobing, a flatbread stuffed with meat, to give workers a taste of home.The plants produce silver-coloured ingots cast from molten aluminium into square-shaped bundles. These are collected by trucks and delivered to factories for processing into goods such as car parts, window frames and beer cans.A 2022 World Economic Forum report anticipated that 2 to 3 million tons of primary aluminium production would move annually to China’s southwest, mostly Yunnan, from 2020 to 2025, tapering to 90,000 to 100,000 tons per year by 2060. The pace has been much slower.Officials had been aware that power was a potential constraint.“Solving power supply issues is the first thing Wenshan needs to work on to develop a green aluminium industry,” He Chun, deputy bureau chief of the Wenshan Energy Bureau, told state media in 2021.But rains proved uncooperative. Yunnan’s Water Resources Department said in January that severe drought had persisted for a fifth year, leading to reduced hydropower generation.On April 16, Wenshan officials warned of extreme drought conditions in Yanshan county, where several aluminium plants are located, including a Hongqiao smelter. Average rainfall so far this year is down 37%, according to the Wenshan government.Adding to the smelters’ dilemma, the NDRC in 2021 banned discounted power rates for aluminium producers.‘MAY THERE BE MORE RAIN’In interviews with Reuters, 10 of the industry figures at smelters that moved to Yunnan described higher-than-expected electricity rates and periodic orders from the energy provider, China Southern Power Grid, to shut down on short notice.Electricity rates had risen to 0.47 to 0.50 yuan per kWh, seven of these people said, still below what smelters paid in the north.China Southern did not respond to a faxed request for comment.Producers including Chinalco-owned Yunnan Aluminium and Henan Shenhuo Coal & Power, neither of which responded to requests for comment, have cited Yunnan’s power-supply problems in financial filings.In its 2023 annual report, Shenhuo warned that further increases in electricity rates or supply disruptions would create uncertainty for its operations.Yunnan has sought to free up electricity by curbing transfers to other provinces. The provincial government has also said it will accelerate construction of wind and solar power, as well as more hydropower stations, and bolster its capacity for thermal power, which mainly comes from coal.But frustrated smelting-industry figures talk of looking elsewhere. “No one dares to stick with their relocation plan” because of Yunnan’s power issues, said a manager at a Yunnan smelter.Analysts expect more capacity to shift to northwestern China, where there is more access to power, including from coal that can assure stable supply for smelters. In May 2023, Weiqiao’s chairman Zhang Bo announced plans with Shandong Chuangxin Group to build a green aluminium base in Inner Mongolia, powered by wind and solar, according to a statement on the regional government’s website.For now, Yunnan smelter operators are looking to the skies.“May there be more rain, that’s the best thing we can wish for,” said one smelter employee.($1 = 7.2448 Chinese yuan renminbi)","May 10, 2024 - 22:26"
24,US election uncertainty clouds UN climate finance progress,"By Valerie Volcovici, Kate Abnett(Reuters) -Countries have a chance to use this week’s U.N. meetings in New York to resolve big differences over boosting the world’s annual goal for climate finance, but uncertainty over the U.S. election could jeopardize progress ahead of the next U.N. climate summit in November.Negotiators told Reuters that countries were reluctant to stake out their positions before knowing who might win the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential vote and be setting climate policy for the world’s largest economy – and biggest historical polluter – for the next four years.But by waiting until November for that answer, countries could be risking the chance of reaching a new deal before the world’s current $100 billion financing pledge expires at the end of this year, the negotiators and observers warned.“The elections are in the calculus” of global climate talks, said finance negotiator Michai Robertson of the Alliance of Small Island States.Governments are analyzing different scenarios for possible wins by Vice President Kamala Harris, who along with President Joe Biden helped pass the biggest domestic climate spending bill in U.S. history, or by former President Donald Trump, a climate denier who wants to boost fossil fuels. They’re also considering a third scenario with the U.S. in limbo for months over an uncertain or delayed election result.“It’s an unspoken understanding that U.S. election uncertainty is affecting how countries are positioning,” Robertson said. While some wealthy countries have said they’d offer more money – they aren’t saying how much more and instead want to “wait to see what direction the U.S. will go.”TRICKY TARGETThis week’s U.N. General Assembly marks the last all-country gathering before the COP29 climate summit begins on Nov. 11 in Baku, Azerbaijan – less than a week after the U.S. vote.But agreeing on a new target, and whether to expand the donor base, is proving tricky. A target too high could mean countries again fail to meet the full amount, which would likely sow tension and mistrust among the developing countries relying on these funds.A target too low would leave too many vulnerable and underserved as global warming continues to escalate. U.N. climate agency chief Simon Stiell has estimated the annual need to be in the trillions in order to adequately help poorer countries shift to clean energy and prepare for the conditions of a warmer world.Failing to set a new target before the start of 2025 could jeopardize future climate negotiations, warned a senior official with Azerbaijan’s COP29 presidency.Azerbaijan doesn’t even want to consider the possibility of failure, the COP29 official told Reuters. DIFFERENT DIRECTIONSRegardless of who wins the U.S. vote, this year’s U.S. climate negotiators are already limited in what they can pledge, although a Harris presidency would ensure more continuity. “Negotiators work for the current administration, not a future one,” noted Jonathan Pershing, a former U.S. delegate who helped lead the country’s talks at the Paris climate summit in 2015. As candidate for president, Harris has said she supports Biden’s climate negotiating positions, including a pledge at last year’s COP28 in Dubai to contribute $3 billion to the global Green Climate Fund.Neither Biden nor Harris have offered a new finance target, but U.S. negotiators have said that fast-growing economies such as China or Gulf oil-producing nations should contribute funds. In the past, China and some Gulf states have said they should be exempt as developing nations.   Trump, on the other hand, has vowed to again withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as well as from the overarching U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change that runs global climate efforts and negotiations among its 198 member states. Only a handful of countries have shunned the UNFCCC, including Iran, Libya and Yemen. MARRAKESH SURPRISE  Given that U.S. elections and U.N. climate summits both fall in November, this year’s election uncertainty is hardly unique. The contested 2000 U.S. election coincided with a climate summit that reached no agreement that year, pushing their talks into a special session held five months later in Bonn, Germany.The next big upset came just a year after the historic Paris Agreement was signed, when U.S. climate negotiators were caught off guard at the U.N. summit in Marrakesh with Trump’s defeat of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the presidency. “The U.S. delegation there was shattered, and negotiators were left scrambling,” said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate think tank E3G, who has attended every COP.This year is different, though. There is new urgency in the climate fight, negotiators said, as rising global temperatures are already triggering climate disasters and extremes. Climate negotiators are also preparing themselves better for unexpected outcomes, said sustainable finance director Paul Bodnar with the Bezos Earth Fund who previously served as a U.S. negotiator under former President Barack Obama.“The difference between now and 2016 is that it was a big surprise in 2016,” he said. After the Trump administration pulled back from the global climate effort, Bodnar built an alliance among the U.S. states and cities stepping up to keep a strong U.S. presence in global climate talks.

25,Swiss party calls for additional storeys for urban housing,"Do you want to read our weekly top stories? Subscribe here.There is hardly any free space left in cities for building developments, Raphael Karlen, a board member of Radical-Liberal Urban, which was founded six years ago, told reporters in Bern on Monday. The solution to creating more living space in cities and preserving green spaces in urban areas is to build them taller, he says.+ ‘Myth’ of spiking Swiss rents comes under scrutinyThe centre-right party is urging Swiss cities to adapt their building and zoning regulations so that houses can systematically be built one storey higher than they are today. This additional storey should be used for residential purposes, it argues. However, the Radical-Liberal Party wants to allow exceptions, such as listed buildings.+ Why is Switzerland a ‘country of tenants’?“Building the city within the city” is how Simone de Montmollin, a Radical-Liberal parliamentarian from Geneva, described their demand for densification. This is an old method: back in the 16th century, houses in Geneva were built higher to create living space for Huguenots who had fled from France.Thanks to a law passed in 2008, it is already possible to add storeys to buildings in Geneva. The opportunity to build 150 new flats per year in Geneva using this measure may not seem like much, but nationwide it could become thousands. The party is thus urging cities and cantons to make additional storeys possible.In Zurich, the Radical-Liberals, the Liberal Greens, the Swiss People’s Party, and the Centre have launched a popular initiative in favour of adding storeys to existing properties. Their aim is not to create an incentive to demolish houses and replace them with new buildings and more expensive flats. The four parties were unable to push through their demand in the city parliament.De Montmollin argued that densification in cities helps stop urban sprawl, reduce the length of people’s commute and preserve land for agriculture. Furthermore, the additions and renovations can contribute to the transformation to sustainable energy use.Adapted from German by DeepL/dkk/sb","April 8, 2024 - 14:36"
26,Zurich Airport CEO: ‘Our mission is to meet all demand’,"Brosi, CEO of Flughafen Zürich AG, must have had a few nervous moments this winter. On March 3, citizens of canton Zurich went to the polls to decide on extending two runways at his airport. As it turned out, 61.7% of voters were in favour.Flughafen Zürich is not a typical company. It is a semi-public listed company, quoted on the Swiss stock exchange and partly owned by the canton (one third of the shares) and the city of Zurich (5%). It not only owns and operates Zurich Airport but has major real-estate and commercial activities around the airport and is involved in operating eight other airports abroad.The company employs around 1,700 people in Zurich and some 475 abroad. In 2023, it posted turnover of CHF1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of CHF677 million. In the same year, passenger numbers hit 28.9 million. SWI swissinfo.ch talked to Brosi at the company’s headquarters. SWI swissinfo.ch: You took over the management of Flughafen Zürich about a year ago. Have you defined a new vision for the company?Lukas Brosi: There was no need. I’ve been working at the airport for 15 years, including seven as chief financial officer. Our company has a long-range focus, so my role is to ensure continuity. However, interacting with the political world and the public was a new area for me. I recently devoted some 20% of my time to these activities, especially prior to the vote on lengthening the runways, which was fortunately approved by the people of Zurich.SWI: What are your airport’s strengths and weaknesses?L.B.: Our airport is located conveniently close to the city of Zurich and has excellent public transport links. Air travellers also appreciate its compact size. The quality of our services is recognised, as shown by the many awards we have received. Our main weakness, however, is our operating hours, which are limited from 6am to 11:30pm. This is more restrictive than many other European airports.SWI: What are the main recent improvements to the traveller experience?L.B.: I’m thinking in particular of the rapid scanners for hand luggage at security checks. We carried out successful trials over the Easter holidays, and these scanners will be deployed from June this year.SWI: Which are the best airports in the world?L.B.: The best airports are those that were built recently, as they have the advantage of starting from scratch with new infrastructure. I’m referring above all to certain airports in the Middle East, for instance in Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, as well as Istanbul airport.SWI: Who are your competitors? L.B.: Rather than talking about direct competition, it would be more accurate to say that we are comparable to Frankfurt, Munich and Vienna airports. Nor are we vying with Geneva or Basel airports, as our catchment areas are different. We also have different business models. We operate as an intercontinental hub, while Geneva and Basel mainly focus on point-to-point connections.SWI: It took a long time for western Switzerland to accept the transfer of long-haul flights from Geneva to Zurich in 1996. Has the hatchet been buried?L.B.: Absolutely!SWI: Officially, you are the Swiss air hub, yet your website is only in German and English. Why not in the other national languages, French and Italian?L.B.: Two-thirds of the users of our website and social networks are German-speaking, while English-speakers account for 25%. This breakdown guided our language choices. As for announcements at our departure gates, we plan to use AI (artificial intelligence) to ensure they are also made in the language of the destination countries.SWI: You are a public limited company quoted on the stock exchange. Is this a plus compared with Geneva Airport, which operates as an autonomous public entity?L.B.: Our privatisation and listing on the Swiss stock exchange, which was approved by the people of Zurich in 2000, were important decisions. This gives us greater business agility and makes us more responsive to the expectations of professional investors. Of course, we also have to deal with local residents, civil society and elected politicians, including some popular votes.The main advantage for the government is that all investments made since 2000 have been financed with private funds obtained via the capital market and airport taxes. This means we have received no public subsidies and, over the past 20 years, we have even paid in CHF1.3 billion to the state (canton, city, municipalities) in the form of taxes and dividends.SWI: What are the most profitable segments of your customer base and how are you working to increase their size?L.B.: Our mission is to meet all demand, and all passengers pay the same airport tax. In other words, we are unable to maximise our profitability in this manner, unlike the airlines.We have found, however, that people travelling for tourism or to visit family spend more time at our airport than those on business trips, leading them to spend more money in our shops and restaurants.SWI: Is it still possible to increase the number of flights?L.B.: With our current infrastructure, we could step up the number of flights, as we still have off-peak moments, such as around 3pm, even if these times are not very popular. It is important to note that the runway extension recently approved by voters concerns only safety and punctuality, and does not as such open the way to increasing the number of flights.SWI: What about the growth in passenger numbers?L.B.: The number of flights has remained relatively stable over the past 20 years, while passenger numbers have risen sharply. This is thanks to the use of larger aircraft and improved seat-occupancy rates. We expect a 2% annual increase in passenger numbers, although this will very much depend on demographic and economic growth.SWI: Reducing air travel is an essential condition for combating global warming, isn’t it?L.B.: I don’t agree with this idea, because global demand for air travel is still growing and the Swiss government has given us the mission of satisfying this demand. In my view, it’s up to the aviation industry to demonstrate its ability to decarbonise, in particular by replacing fossil fuels with sustainable alternatives.Although these alternatives currently account for only 2% to 3%, it’s essential to start somewhere. The aim is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, a goal deemed achievable according to a Swiss government report

. As far as our airport infrastructure is concerned, we are investing hundreds of millions of francs to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.SWI: You are also involved in eight airports in developing countries. What is your state shareholders’ position on this?L.B.: Owning, managing and building airports abroad is part of our diversification strategy, based on our core competencies. To minimise risk, we focus on infrastructure in urgent need of private investment to meet high demand, irrespective of the political orientation of the national government in question. What’s more, we operate mainly in countries such as Brazil and India, which have a good track record of privatisation.It should not be assumed that we aspire to become the world’s largest airport operator: our approach is more opportunistic. And here our state shareholders (the canton and city of Zurich) fully support our strategy.Edited by Samuel Jaberg. Adapted from French by Julia Bassam/ts","April 29, 2024 - 09:00"
27,"UK pay growth drops to lowest in nearly 2 years, joblessness falls","By David MillikenLONDON (Reuters) -British pay grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years, likely reassuring the Bank of England that inflation pressures are easing, and there was a surprise drop in unemployment, official figures showed on Tuesday.Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, were 5.4% higher than a year earlier in the three months to the end of June, down from 5.8% in the three months to May and the lowest since August 2022, the Office for National Statistics said.However, the jobless rate – based on a survey the ONS is currently overhauling – fell from 4.4% to 4.2%, its lowest since February, bucking expectations of a rise in a Reuters poll of economists.Sterling strengthened against the U.S. dollar immediately after the data was published.When it cut interest rates on Aug. 1 after keeping them at a 16-year high of 5.25% for nearly a year, the BoE said it would continue to keep a close eye on wage growth. Investors see a roughly one-in-three chance of a September BoE rate cut.Pay is still growing at nearly double the pace the BoE thinks is compatible with keeping inflation at its 2% target. Data on Wednesday is likely to show inflation back above target.“Today’s data are consistent with a gradual and cautious dialling down of restrictive policy. But … firming GDP growth, if sustained, could lead to a firming labour market recovery – which could result in a more shallow rate-cutting cycle,” said Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank.The number of people in work rose by 97,000, far more than the 3,000 forecast by economists.Raja said the lower unemployment rate might also be down partly to a slight overstatement of joblessness in the past by the ONS. It said response rates to its labour force survey had improved since the start of the year.The Resolution Foundation think tank said it feared the ONS was still undercounting people in work.PAY PRESSURE EASING?Employers expect lower headline inflation to reduce wage pressures. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development on Monday said employers expected to raise pay by 3%, the lowest in two years.Last month Britain’s new finance minister Rachel Reeves approved pay rises of at least 5% for millions of public sector workers.The BoE is more focused on private-sector pay which it forecasts will slow to 5% in late 2024 and 3% in late 2025.Growth in regular pay in the private sector in the three months to June slowed to 5.2%, its lowest since May 2022, from 5.6% in the three months to May.After adjusting for lower inflation, workers are now doing better. Real pay excluding bonuses is 3.2% higher than a year ago, the joint-biggest annual increase since mid-2021.Growth in average earnings including bonuses and other one-off payments dropped sharply to 4.5%, its lowest since late 2021, reflecting backdated payments for public health workers a year earlier.Public sector regular pay growth dropped to a five-month low of 6.0% from 6.4%.The BoE also looks at other inflation pressures such as labour shortages, which leapt during the COVID-19 pandemic.The number of unfilled job vacancies fell to a three-year low of 884,000 in the three months to July, down from 1.3 million in mid-2022 but still higher than in early 2020.“Vacancies are still challenging to fill in a number of pockets and near-record working age inactivity at 9.4 million continues to be a key factor behind this,” said Jack Kennedy, senior economist at hiring platform Indeed.The percentage of working-age people who are neither in jobs nor unemployed – due to poor health, full-time study, caring responsibilities or other factors – edged up to 22.2% in the three months to June, near an eight-year high.The new government wants to raise labour force participation to 80% – a level reached by the Netherlands, Switzerland and New Zealand but no larger economies.Reeves said Tuesday’s data showed the importance of getting more people into work.“This will be part of my Budget later in the year where I will be making difficult decisions on spending, welfare and tax,” she said. The budget is due on Sept. 30.(Reporting by David Milliken; editing by William Schomberg and Kirsten Donovan)","August 13, 2024 - 16:45"
28,EFTA signs revised free trade agreement with Chile,"Check out our selection of newsletters. Subscribe here.The revised agreement with Chile was signed at a ministerial meeting of EFTA states (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway) in Geneva on Monday. Switzerland is the current chair.Parmelin told reporters that he was confident about the improvement of business opportunities, market access and the legal framework with Chile.Negotiations were concluded last January after five years. Compared to the first agreement 20 years ago, components on sustainable development, financial arrangements, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and e-commerce have been added.+ EFTA updates free trade agreement with ChileThe new agreement will improve exports and the competitiveness of SMEs, which make up more than 90% of the volume of business in Switzerland, the economics minister told the Keystone-SDA news agency.+ Switzerland signs free trade deal with IndiaIn recent free trade deals, the focus has mostly been on pharmaceuticals and multinationals. However, since the signing of the agreement with India a few months ago, SMEs have become more of an issue, noted Parmelin.+ Explainer: Will the India-EFTA pact be a ‘game-changer’?From now on, 99.99% of Swiss exports to Chile will be exempt from customs duties. All intellectual property rights will also be applied. Total trade of goods between EFTA and Chile is estimated to have reached nearly CHF1 billion ($1.12 billion) in 2023.Chile’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alberto van Klaveren, pointed out that the link with EFTA was a very important part of his country’s policy with Europe. It comes a few months after a similar arrangement with the European Union.He said there had been no obligation to sign the agreement with Switzerland and the three partners ahead of a possible similar agreement between EFTA and the South American trade bloc, known as Mercosur. “We would very much welcome an agreement between Mercosur and the EU, as well as between Mercosur and EFTA,” he said.Parmelin also sees no direct link between the EFTA-Chile agreement signed on Monday and the more difficult negotiations with Mercosur. These talks were relaunched at the end of April after a five-year break due to the coronavirus pandemic and the political situation in South America. According to other sources, the dialogue is not good.Former Argentinian President Alberto Fernandez dragged out talks for months. And while Argentina is now more favourable to negotiations, current Brazilian President Luiz Inazio Lula da Silva has new demands.“There was a window of opportunity,” said Parmelin. A few months ago, he was not ruling out the possibility of an agreement this year, but he is even more cautious now. “There are intellectual property issues on which Brazil has brought back to the negotiating table, although they had already been settled in 2019,” he said.Other issues such as public procurement are also under discussion. “I prefer us to take things one step at a time,” insisted the Swiss minister. No date has yet been set for the next round of negotiations, according to the same sources.On the other hand, Parmelin is “relatively optimistic” about the discussions on a revised trade agreement with China. However, he said it was “difficult to say” when a new arrangement would be reached. “China is showing interest”, he said. China’s domestic situation, in particular the difficulties in the property market, is pushing it to engage in dialogue.+ China edges closer to free trade update with SwitzerlandIt took about six years to identify the points that could be discussed, according to the Swiss minister. However, since the signing of the agreement between EFTA and India a few months ago, China’s interest has also increased. Parmelin also believes agreement has been reached regarding a first phase of the deal.He will be in China next week to launch the second stage of this process, which consists of an assessment of the parties’ manoeuvrability on the issues to be discussed. The negotiations themselves are scheduled for a third phase.Adapted from French by DeepL/dkk/sb","June 24, 2024 - 15:31"

30,Palestinians brace for Rafah assault as Israel promises evacuation plan,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Henriette ChacarDOHA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israeli air strikes killed 17 people in Rafah on the Gaza border overnight, medics said on Saturday, as over a million Palestinians crammed into the city awaited a full-scale offensive with the rest of the enclave in ruins and nowhere left to run.Four months into the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it had ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate Rafah and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there.The Israeli military said the air force killed two Hamas operatives in Rafah on Saturday.Israel’s military ordered civilians to flee south before previous assaults on Gaza’s cities, but now there is no obvious place to go and aid agencies have said many people could die.“Any Israeli incursion in Rafah means massacres, means destruction. People are filling every inch of the city and we have nowhere to go,” said Rezik Salah, 35, who fled from Gaza City for Rafah with his wife and two children early in the war.A possible assault on Rafah prompted international concern, including posts on social media from British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot.“Deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah – over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area. The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire,” Cameron said on X, formerly known as Twitter.“Hard to see how large-scale military operations in such a densely populated area would not lead to many civilian casualties and a bigger humanitarian catastrophe. This is unjustifiable,” Bruins Slot said.AIRSTRIKESThe conflict in Gaza began on Oct. 7 when Hamas gunmen stormed border defences to attack Israeli towns, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Israel responded with a massive bombardment and ground offensive in which about 28,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed, according to medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.The conflict has threatened to spread across the Middle East, with Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah regularly trading fire, and flare-ups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.In Yemen, the Iranian-backed Houthi militia held a funeral on Saturday for at least 17 militants killed during joint U.S.-British airstrikes, the Houthi-run Saba news agency said.The Houthis have used drones to attack merchant ships since Nov. 19 in what they say is a response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza, prompting retaliatory strikes from Britain and the United States.The U.S. Central Command said its forces conducted self-defence strikes against Houthi missiles and drones on Saturday.In Lebanon, an Israeli strike targeted a Palestinian figure close to Hamas, security sources said. The target survived but three others were killed, including a member of Hezbollah.Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble by Israeli airstrikes, artillery fire and controlled detonations. More than 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million inhabitants have been left homeless.Most of the displaced have sought shelter in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, but after fruitless ceasefire talks, Netanyahu this week said Israeli forces would fight on until “total victory.”On Friday night an airstrike on a Rafah house killed 11 people and wounded dozens and a second strike killed six people in another house, medical officials said. Earlier on Saturday two separate Israeli airstrikes killed five members of the Hamas-run police force in Rafah, including a senior officer, Hamas and medics said.In the other main southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where many displaced people initially fled before an Israeli offensive last month, the Palestinian Health Ministry voiced alarm at Israeli operations around the main Nasser Hospital.The ministry said Israeli forces had surrounded the hospital and were shooting in the vicinity, raising concerns about 300 medical staff, 450 patients and 10,000 people sheltering there.Footage circulating on social media, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed tanks at the hospital gates.Israel’s military said its forces were continuing intensive activities in Khan Younis as well as northern and central Gaza, killing militants, seizing weapons and striking infrastructure.It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the situation at Nasser hospital.FIERCE FIGHTINGIn Gaza City, the first major population center targeted after Israeli ground forces invaded in October, residents reported fierce fighting on Saturday.Israel said its forces had discovered a tunnel network hundreds of metres (yards) long running partly under the Gaza City headquarters of UNRWA, the main relief agency for Palestinians.The military said it was evidence of how Hamas had exploited UNRWA, which has launched an internal probe and seen some donor countries freeze funding over Israel’s allegations that 12 of its roughly 13,000 employees in the Gaza Strip had participated in the Oct. 7 attacks.UNRWA said its staff left its headquarters in Gaza City on Oct. 12 following Israeli evacuation orders.“We have not used that compound since we left it nor are we aware of any activity that may have taken place there,” It said.An Israeli official who declined to be named said Israel would try to organise for people in Rafah to be moved back north ahead of any assault.Egypt has said it will not allow any mass displacement of Palestinians into its territory. Palestinians fear Israel means to drive them from their homeland, then forbid their return.The continued warfare in Gaza City, long after Israel said it was redeploying some troops to other areas, shows the limitations of any evacuation proposal.Palestinian rescue workers in Gaza City said they had found the bodies of a six-year-old girl and her family members, along with the ambulance team sent to rescue them, days after an audio clip of her call to dispatchers begging for help was released.(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Doha and Henriette Chacar in Jerusalem; Writing by Jonathan Landay, Angus McDowall, Giles Elgood and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Diane Craft, Toby Chopra, Barbara Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)","February 11, 2024 - 03:01"
31,Swiss fintech sector thrives with record number of companies,"At the end of 2023, there were 483 fintech companies in Switzerland – more than ever before. According to the iinTech study published by Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts on Thursday, this is around 11 % than in the previous year. This means that the sector has tripled in size since 2015. Liechtenstein was also included in the study for the first time: 22 FinTech companies are based in the principality.Growth was particularly strong last year among fintech companies with a strategic focus on sustainability (23%). According to the study, they account for around 10% of all Swiss fintech companies.Investors’ interest in sustainable investment opportunities is high, according to study director Thomas Ankenbrand. The banks’ obligation to ask private investors about their sustainability preferences further favours this growth.However, there are also signs of a cooling trend. Switzerland is facing more competition, says Ankenbrand. Stockholm has overtaken Zurich and Geneva in the ranking of the most attractive locations for fintech companies, knocking them out of second and third place.However, the third and fourth places prove that the general conditions for fintech in Switzerland are still good, says the head of the study. However, leading international fintech locations such as Amsterdam have caught up.The first representatives from the USA are New York and San Francisco in 6th and 7th place. The first German city is Berlin in 10th place, with Singapore still leading the list by a large margin.In addition, the financing of fintech companies decreased in 2023, both in terms of volume and the number of transactions. In the previous year, a total of CHF457 million ($518 million) flowed into the Swiss fintech sector in 68 financing rounds.in 2022, this figure was still CHF605 million in 84 financing rounds, according to the study. Whether this decline is a structural slowdown or is driven by a temporary interest rate effect cannot yet be determined.Fintech has developed from a niche market into a significant innovation provider for traditional financial service providers. However, the potential has not yet been exhausted, says Ankenbrand.There is great potential for the financial sector in the field of artificial intelligence. Dynamic adaptation to new technological developments would benefit Switzerland as a business location and the local fintech sector.

32,Explainer: why should we care about science diplomacy?,"Many of the major challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, food security, pandemics and the risks of artificial intelligence have scientific aspects, and science plays a crucial role in addressing them.Recognising the potential impact of science on global affairs and the need to come up with solutions, several countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Switzerland have created posts of science advisors within their foreign ministries. Some have also posted science attachés to key embassies.Since 2010 science diplomacy has a formal definition made up of three pillars:Science diplomacy is any one of the three, or a combination of two or three pillars.CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), created in 1954, is often considered a success story of science diplomacy. Initially the institute launched by 11 countries aimed to conduct research in atomic physics through international collaboration. Today it includes 23 countries ranging from the UK to Israel and Hungary. CERN made possible some of the first contacts between Israeli and German scientists after the Second World War. However, Cédric Dupont, Professor of International Relations at the Geneva Graduate Institute, argues that “it is an overstated example of science diplomacy. Whether it is about science diplomacy or purely scientific research is an open question.”As opposed to the fight against fossil fuels, which has yet to reach international consensus, the battle against the hole in the ozone layer and the chemicals contributing to it is another example of successful science diplomacy. The Montreal Protocol, adopted in 1987, is one of the rare treaties to achieve universal ratification. The protocol is a multilateral agreement that regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals referred to as ozone-depleting substances.Science diplomacy also paved the way for the signing of the Antarctic treaty in 1959. The treaty protects the region from military activities and the exploitation of mineral resources.Another well-known example is the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, established by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) to provide policy-makers with a scientific view of climate change. Its reports, released every six or seven years, provide key input for international negotiators to tackle climate change.Achieving scientific consensus takes time – years, decades and sometimes centuries. “During the time leading up to a consensus, if you offer many scientific opinions to diplomats, it is hard to think that they will converge on anything,” says Dupont. “The first 20 years of the IPCC’s work was undermined by that. Some scientists managed to throw a spanner in the works, by claiming they were not convinced about human-caused climate change.”Another challenge is that research funding is anything but neutral, he argues. “Very little scientific research has been done in certain domains, due to the lack of interest from the main economic powers, the Global North. Therefore, diplomats will not get involved, simply because there is no science available. Funding of science follows trends and politics. Lots of countries in the world have very limited research capacity, so there is a risk of imposing the research agenda of the North on global politics.”Another challenge to overcome is a misalignment between the time horizon of scientists and politicians. “Politicians tend to think short-term, while a lot of research in natural sciences is carried out in the long-term,” says Dupont.“Lastly, how much science remains once you have gone through the cycle of international discussions is a question,” he says. “The IPCC report, for example, puts increasing pressure on states, although probably not enough yet, as politicians have been able to push back so far. But without the IPCC report, we wouldn’t know what’s going on.”Geneva is home to many international organisations that focus on science such as the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), ISO (International Organization for Standardization), ITU (International Telecommunications Union) and WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization). Nonetheless experts argue that these entities cooperate technically on issues such as standards and patents rather than innovate or use science as a solution to global problems.“Science diplomacy is another level,” says Dupont. “It involves more fundamental research in science that gets to reframe the discussions at an international level. That’s what we mean by science diplomacy. Geneva has potential to become a centre for science diplomacy, but I don’t think it is there yet.”Switzerland’s aim is to position International Geneva as a leading hub for discussing digitalisation and technology and finding solutions to challenges these issues raise.This allows the country to pull some weight on the international scene while maintaining its neutrality. With this in mind, the Swiss government and the canton of Geneva created GESDA (Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator) in 2019 with the purpose of positioning the city as the world stage of science diplomacy. Its mission is to bring together different communities to anticipate scientific and technological advancements and, based on these, develop solutions for a sustainable future.“The objective of the Swiss government is to keep International Geneva as a vibrant place for international cooperation,” says Dupont. “But this is not guaranteed. If multilateralism is under threat, there is no guarantee that Geneva can keep it forever. Therefore, you have to continue investing in it.”Edited by Virginie Mangin","October 13, 2023 - 09:00"
33,AI Mania Driving Nasdaq 100’s Best Run Since 1999: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — A banner year for stocks is drawing to an end, with the market near all-time highs amid the artificial-intelligence exuberance and dovish Federal Reserve wagers.In the run-up to the final closing bell of 2023, the Nasdaq 100 wavered — while still set for its best year since 1999 after a $7 trillion surge. The S&P 500 came close to a record, and was 1% below the average full-year gain predicted in a recent survey with analysts, who forecast the index would end 2024 at 4,833.“If the stock market can break through that record high in any significant way as we move through January, it’s going to be very bullish on a technical basis,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co. “Whenever the market is rallying strongly at the beginning of a new year — when a lot of people are adjusting their investment-game plans — it tends to exacerbate the rally.”In a rates-obsessed world, the stock market saw a massive reversal this year after suffering its worst annual selloff since 2008. As traders ramped up bets the Fed is done with its hiking campaign — and will start easing policy in 2024 — global bonds were set for their biggest two-month gain on record.The S&P 500 traded just a few points away from its all-time high of 4,796.56 — extending its 2023 advance to 25%. Treasuries dropped after a weak $40 billion sale of seven-year notes. The dollar rose against most of its developed-market peers. The yen climbed as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda continued to prepare the ground for the nation’s first rate increase since 2007.From Nvidia Corp. to Microsoft Corp., the seven-largest US tech stocks were responsible for 64% of the gauge’s rally this year through last week as the AI frenzy took off. The Nasdaq 100 is up over 50% this year.The ‘Magnificent Seven’ — which also includes Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post 22% earnings growth next year, twice the S&P 500’s advance, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The key is how much of that is already baked into share prices, especially with expectations for a soft landing building.“Companies that have a defined and clear AI strategy with easy-to-follow metrics will likely continue to do well in 2024,” said Michael Landsberg at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Companies that have a hard time explaining their AI value proposition will not see a repeat of 2023, where most large tech was buoyed by the excitement and not necessarily the details of AI.”Investors have flocked to big tech in part on bets that they are best positioned to capitalize on AI due to their vast scale and financial strength. Those bigger profits have brought valuations down from nosebleed levels — but they’re still lofty. The Nasdaq 100 is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from a peak of 30 in 2020, it’s well above the average of 19 times over the past two decades.Although there has been a relatively high number of stocks with gains of over 100%, there haven’t been many outperforming the S&P 500, Bespoke Investment Group noted. In a typical year, on average, 48.7% of the benchmark’s members post larger gains than the index itself. In 2023, less than 30% of its members are outpacing the index. “This leads one to question whether the leaders (or laggards) continue to lead (lag) in the year ahead,” the Bespoke strategists said. “Looking at the past, the picture is not exactly favorable for that sort of rotation in either direction.”The market is “sitting on big gains” and most participants just want the year to end to register those gains, according to Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter. “But I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that when everyone seems to be leaning on one side of the proverbial canoe, it pays to move to the middle.”Warnings about a market that’s flashing overbought signals have been raising concern about a pullback, with some market observers saying that traders have gone too far, too fast in pricing in a dovish Fed pivot.While the recent ebbing of inflation is positive for the Fed, some other figures showing economic resilience could fuel consumer spending — working against the central bank’s aim to slow the pace of growth. That poses risks for the bond market heading into the new year.Falling yields have also driven the dollar lower in 2023, with the greenback on pace for its worst year since the onset of the pandemic. Much of the decline materialized in the fourth quarter on growing wagers that the Fed will sharply loosen policy next year.The drop in Treasury yields has effectively relaxed financial conditions in the US and “are hardly compatible with sustainably low inflation,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote.“The rally in the sovereign space looks overdone — hence the rally in stocks and the selloff in the US dollar look overstretched,” she wrote in a note.About a week ahead of the all-important US jobs report, traders were unfazed by data showing initial jobless claims rose to 218,000. Economists forecast a still-healthy 170,000 increase in December payrolls, consistent with resilient labor demand that has been key in powering the economy.Elsewhere, oil retreated for the fourth time in five sessions as rising inventories at the key US storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, partly offset a drop in national stockpiles to paint a mixed picture for demand.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Richard Henderson, Robert Brand, Jessica Menton, Elena Popina, Ishika Mookerjee, Jeran Wittenstein and Carmen Reinicke.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","January 10, 2024 - 14:20"

35,Treasury Yields Slide as Fedspeak Fuels Pivot Bets: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Treasuries extended their November rally, the dollar fell and stocks edged higher on speculation the Federal Reserve is done with interest-rate hikes and will be able to ease policy next year.Fed swaps are now anticipating over 100 basis points of rate cuts by the end of 2024. In a speech entitled “Something Appears to Be Giving,” Governor Christopher Waller — one of the most-hawkish officials — said he’s “increasingly confident that policy is currently well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2%.” While acknowledging the many uncertainties, his colleague Michelle Bowman refrained from telegraphing an imminent hike.To Peter Williams at 22V Research, the chances of a dovish pivot or reset seem to be increasing even as Fed-induced recession odds recede.“It is growing expectations that the Fed and other major central banks are basically done with hiking interest rates,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com. “Markets are getting a bit over excited, but traders are just looking to take advantage of the momentum — and will be asking questions later.”Two-year yields dropped 14 basis points to around 4.75%. The dollar fell to its lowest since August. After swinging between small gains and losses, the S&P 500 managed to close with a small advance. The gauge, which is trading near “overbought” levels, is still headed toward one of its biggest November gains on record. Bitcoin climbed back above $38,000.Read: Treasury 7-Year Note Auction Tails After Rally Into Bid DeadlineAlso speaking Tuesday, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the inflation slowdown this year has been the biggest such drop in 71 years. His New York counterpart John Williams called the decline encouraging.On the economic front, US consumer confidence rose for the first time in four months in November, aided by more optimistic views about the outlook for the labor market. Home prices hit a fresh record high, according to seasonally adjusted data from S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller.The good news for investors is that recession isn’t here yet, this makes an end-of-year rally likely, according to Lauren Goodwin at New York Life Investments. In past economic cycles, markets don’t tend to price in recession until jobless claims are rising and earnings are in outright decline — signs that recession has already arrived, she noted.“Modest slowdowns in inflation and employment growth mean that a ‘Fed relief rally,’ accompanied by rallies in stocks, bonds and credit as we are seeing now, can be sustained,” Goodwin said. “Our concern is that this late cycle limbo is no different than those of the past: a moment of Goldilocks before the very reason that inflation is moderating – slowing economic growth and employment – becomes clear in the data.”The most-active investors in the Treasury market are as bullish as they’ve ever been, according to a weekly survey conducted by JPMorgan Chase & Co. since 1991.JPMorgan’s Treasury client survey for the week ended Nov. 27 found that 78% of active clients were positioned long relative to their benchmark, up from 56% the previous week. None of them were positioned short for a second straight week, for a 78% net long position that was the biggest in the history of the survey. The remaining respondents were neutral.Meantime, the recent sharp pullback in volatility as year-end approaches creates hedging opportunities given the cloudy outlook for equities, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist Christian Mueller-Glissmann.“After the recent equity rally, we believe there is an attractive entry point to hedge the risk of a retracement,” he noted. “Cross-asset volatility has continued to reset lower, supported by markets further embracing the ‘inverse’ Goldilocks backdrop in the US with faster-than-expected inflation normalization and growth remaining resilient.”Bank of America Corp. clients were net buyers of US equities last week, with institutional and retail investors leading purchases while hedge funds offloaded shares. Clients funneled $2.6 billion into US stocks, with inflows to both individual names and exchange-traded funds, quantitative strategists led by Jill Carey Hall said.This month’s rally in the S&P 500 is now running out of steam, according to Citigroup Inc. strategist Chris Montagu. He said futures flows last week were “mixed,” leaving net positioning in the benchmark index looking “slightly bearish.”A Bloomberg Intelligence model known as the Market Regime Index — which clusters periods into three phases dubbed accelerated growth (green), moderate growth (yellow) and decline (red) — has remained stuck in the middle for the past nine months. That suggests that equity-return expectations should remain average until the Fed shifts away from raising interest rates to cutting them, according to BI’s chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams and senior associate analyst Gillian Wolff.Hedge funds piled into bullish dollar bets this month despite the currency’s slide on softening US economic data and increasing expectations that the Fed’s most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in a generation is near an end. A metric of leveraged funds’ net longs on the greenback against eight currencies rose to its highest level since February 2022 as of Nov. 21, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission aggregated by Bloomberg. It stood at net long 103,042 contracts, just above a previous year-to-date high seen in April, after bottoming around a net short position of around 72,000 contracts in March.“The US dollar has been weakening across the board as the market becomes increasingly convinced that the next move from the US central bank will be to cut interest rates, possibly as early as the second quarter,” Razaqzada noted.Elsewhere, oil snapped a three-session losing streak as OPEC+ members continued negotiations over output levels.Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Jason Scott, Tassia Sipahutar, Alex Nicholson, Carter Johnson, Masaki Kondo, Michael Msika, Michael Mackenzie and Edward Bolingbroke.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","November 28, 2023 - 21:30"
36,"Climate change will escalate child health crisis due to malnutrition, says Gates","(Corrects budget total in final paragraph)By Jennifer RigbyLONDON (Reuters) -Malnutrition is the world’s worst child health crisis and climate change will only make things more severe, according to Microsoft-co-founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates.Between now and 2050, 40 million more children will have stunted growth and 28 million more will suffer from wasting, the most extreme and irreversible forms of malnutrition, as a result of climate change, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said in a report on Tuesday.“Unless you get the right food, broadly, both in utero and in your early years, you can never catch up,” Gates told Reuters in an online interview last week, referring to a child’s physical and mental capacity, both of which are held back by a lack of good nutrition. Children without enough of the right food are also more vulnerable to diseases like measles and malaria, and early death.“Around 90% of the negative effect of climate change works through the food system. Where you have years where your crops basically fail because of drought or too much rain,” he said.Gates was speaking ahead of the publication of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s annual Goalkeepers report, which tracks progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), around reducing poverty and improving health. The report includes the projections above.In 2023, the World Health Organization estimated that 148 million children experienced stunting and 45 million experienced wasting.Gates called for more funding for nutrition, particularly through a new platform led by UNICEF aiming to co-ordinate donor financing, the Child Nutrition Fund, as well as more research. But he said the money should not be taken away from other proven initiatives, like routine childhood vaccinations, for this purpose.“(Nutrition) was under-researched … it’s eye-opening how important this is,” he added, saying initiatives like food fortification or improving access to prenatal multi-vitamins could be as effective as some vaccines in improving child health in the world’s poorest countries.The Gates Foundation said in January it plans to spend more on global health this year than ever before – $8.6 billion – as wider funding efforts stall.(Reporting by Jennifer Rigby; Editing by Susan Fenton)","September 17, 2024 - 11:46"
37,How the Bank of Japan’s plan for a smooth stimulus exit stumbled,"By Leika Kihara, Takahiko Wada, Mariko KatsumuraTOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan’s strategy for an orderly exit from years of massive stimulus unraveled on an overcast day in December when Governor Kazuo Ueda and two deputies gathered at the bank’s Tokyo headquarters.Inflation was slowing more than expected, complicating the central bank’s plan to end negative interest rates by March or April and then follow quickly with further increases. The officials considered two alternatives.The first option was to wait for signs of economic improvement and then go ahead as planned. The second was to end negative rates but hold off on subsequent increases. Ultimately, the MIT-trained Ueda went with the second option, allowing Japan to shed its title as the last country with negative interest rates but leaving it short of its hoped-for normalisation and still facing years of near-zero rates that pressure the hard-hit yen.“With the economy lacking momentum, there was a growing feeling within the BOJ that inflation might not stay around 2% that long,” said one person familiar with the deliberations, referring to the bank’s key target.“The BOJ leadership probably realised that time was running short, if they wanted to end negative rates.”The decision was also complicated by differences between Ueda’s two deputies, as well as the governor’s wavering on the exit timing. The existence of the two plans, and other details about the deliberations, are reported for the first time by Reuters.This account is based on interviews with 25 incumbent and former central bank officials with direct knowledge of the interactions, or familiar with the personalities and dynamics of the bank’s leaders, as well as five government officials in regular contact with BOJ officials.They all spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss the matters publicly.A BOJ spokesperson said the bank would not comment on the deliberations outlined by Reuters. Reuters also spoke to five small-business owners to gauge how the policy shift could unfold across an economy battered by decline and deflation.On Tuesday, the BOJ drew the curtain on eight years of negative rates and other remnants of unorthodox policy, delivering its first increase in borrowing costs since 2007.“It’s a watershed moment for Japan and for central banks across the world, as it finally puts an end to abnormal monetary stimulus,” said former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago.Still, he said, it could take several years for short-term rates to move up to even 1%.LOCAL TREMORS Even a slight rise in interest rates could send tremors through struggling local economies in Japan, reflecting how deflation and a diminishing population have squeezed demand.“The prospect of higher interest rates has become a significant concern for traditional inns,” said Koji Ishida, who runs a hotel company and heads the local tourism association in Yugawara, a hot-spring resort southwest of Tokyo known for its ryokan, or traditional inns.In autumn, Ishida received a frantic call from the family that owns one of the town’s most storied ryokan, saying it was nearing collapse and asking for help.“As neighbours, we needed to help them,” Ishida said. He worried the failure of a prominent ryokan could tarnish the image of tourism-dependent Yugawara and trigger “a chain reaction of bankruptcies”.Seiranso, a 94-year-old ryokan known for its mountainside outdoor bath at the foot of a waterfall, last month filed for bankruptcy protection with around 850 million yen ($5.7 million) in debt, including pandemic loans.Under those proceedings, it aims to turn itself around with backing from Ishida’s company, according to its website. A lawyer for Seiranso declined to comment.Almost one-third of ryokan lost money in the last financial year, according to data from the Japan Ryokan and Hotel Association, an industry group.“The industry needs zero-interest rates,” said Masanori Numao, whose family runs a ryokan in Kinugawa Onsen, a hot-spring resort in Nikko National Park, where their roots go back more than 300 years.Forty years ago, Kinugawa was thriving; after sunset there were “beautiful geisha”, the clatter of wooden geta clogs and laughter from karaoke bars that lined the narrow streets, Numao said.Today, tourists sometimes photograph derelict hotels abandoned after the bubble economy burst in the early 1990s. Ryokan owners struggle to renovate ageing buildings because banks are unwilling to lend them more, making it difficult to attract tourists, Numao said. Higher interest rates would increase pressure on hot-spring towns like Kinugawa, he said. “The government is just watching resort towns drown.”POLICY DIFFERENCESIn taking over the BOJ last April, Ueda was mandated to dismantle the radical stimulus of his predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda.Kuroda’s “bazooka” approach initially helped boost stock prices. But it crushed bank margins and caused unwelcome yen declines that lawmakers feared could hurt voters through rising living costs.Ueda and his deputies were unanimous on the need for an exit, but not on the timing.Choosing the second option mended, at least momentarily, the quiet tension between the two deputy governors, career central banker Shinichi Uchida and former bank regulator Ryozo Himino.Ueda, Uchida and Himino did not respond to Reuters questions.Uchida was cautious about ending negative rates too hastily, believing that the BOJ should allow the economy to run hot by keeping ultra-low rates for a prolonged period.By contrast, Himino favoured an early exit from what he saw as excessive monetary support that could sow the seeds of a future bubble.As an outsider, Himino wasn’t afraid to challenge some of the bank’s traditions.At one informal meeting late last year, he complained about the BOJ’s management style and suggested changes, ruffling feathers among some officials within the institution, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.Throughout the discussions, Ueda would listen silently and rarely spoke up. People who know him say the governor was neither a hawk nor a dove.Having studied under former Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer, who also taught former central bankers Ben Bernanke and Mario Draghi, Ueda combined faith in economic models and a sense of pragmatism.However, he was not quick to make decisions, opting to analyse various options thoroughly until the last minute. “He’s a pure academic who’s great at comparing data and strategies,” said a person who has known Ueda for decades. “But making quick, decisive decisions isn’t his strength.”While the two deputies rarely exhibited differences in public, it was usually Uchida who prevailed. Ueda relied heavily on Uchida’s expertise on the technical aspects of the bank’s monetary tools.Uchida was also the main interlocutor with officials from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government, sounding out their views on monetary policy and laying the groundwork for an exit.Kishida’s administration had been nudging the BOJ to phase out stimulus in hope it would slow declines in the yen that were hurting households through higher food and fuel costs.“The government hopes the BOJ conducts monetary policy appropriately towards sustainably and stably achieving its price target accompanied by wage increases, with an eye on economic, price and financial developments,” a spokesperson for the prime minister’s office told Reuters.Once there was consensus the BOJ would go with the second option, Uchida proceeded with the next step of preparing markets.In a speech in Nara in February, Uchida hinted at what a post-negative rate monetary policy would look like.Tuesday’s policy shift roughly aligned with those clues.Ueda’s choice of the second option means the BOJ will keep rates at zero for a prolonged period, delaying Japan’s return to normal borrowing costs, said five of the sources familiar with the bank’s thinking. It will likely take years to reduce the bank’s balance sheet, which had ballooned after heavy asset-buying, three analysts told Reuters.There is near-consensus among BOJ watchers that the bank will move very gradually, and allow short-term rates to rise to around 0.5% over several years.“Given Mr. Ueda’s very cautious character and his focus on building consensus within the board, he will likely take plenty of time and proceed carefully in normalising policy,” said former BOJ economist Hideo Hayakawa.($1 = 148.3800 yen)(Reporting by Leika Kihara, Takahiko Wada and Mariko Katsumura, Additional reporting by Daniel Leussink, Tetsushi Kajimoto, Yoshifumi Takemoto, Kentaro Sugiyama, Takaya Yamaguchi and Anton Bridge; Editing by David Dolan and David Crawshaw)","March 21, 2024 - 03:07"
38,Switzerland signs free trade deal with India,"The Swiss Economic Minister Guy Parmelin and his counterparts from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway signed a free trade agreement with the Indian Minister of Commerce, Piyush Goyal, in New Delhi on Sunday. The majority of customs duties will be suspended.The signing of the agreement between the EFTA member states and India, after 16 years of negotiations, represents an important milestone for our country’s commercial policy, the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research said on Sunday.Switzerland and the other member states of the EFTA are the first European partners to sign a free trade agreement with India. Video messages from India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Swiss President Viola Amherd, were released at the signing ceremony.The Swiss economic ministry pointed out that India is the most populous country in the world. Its growing middle class, in particular, gives it strong growth potential. India currently levies very high customs duties on most imported products.Thanks to the free trade agreement, India will abolish or partially liberalise, with immediate effect or after transitional periods, the customs duties on 95.3% of industrial products imported from Switzerland (with the exception of gold).India will also grant Switzerland duty-free access to its market for certain agricultural products after a transitional period of up to ten years. This will enhance the competitiveness of Swiss exports to India. The concessions granted by Switzerland to India on agricultural products are in line with current free trade agreements and are in line with Swiss agricultural policy, the ministry emphasised.Improvements have been achieved in the area of intellectual property rights, particularly with regard to legal certainty, patent procedures and the protection of the “Swiss” designation (Swissness). Access to medicines in India remains unaffected.Thanks to this agreement, Swiss economic players will gain broad access to the Indian market and will benefit from improved legal conditions, legal certainty and predictability, the press release adds.The free trade agreement contains general and binding provisions on “trade and sustainable development”. These will enable the EFTA States to integrate these aspects into their trade with India.Another chapter concerns the promotion of investment in India by EFTA companies. This is the result of the “keen interest” shown by India in attracting more investment from Swiss companies or from other EFTA States.The parliamentary approval procedure will be launched without delay so that Switzerland can ratify the agreement by 2025 at the latest, concluded the economic ministry.Adapted from French by DeepL/ac","March 10, 2024 - 10:32"
39,Voters to decide on major Swiss motorway expansion,"The A1 motorway stretches 410 kilometres from the east to the west of Switzerland. It is the longest motorway in the country. It is also the most congested, with 16,279 hours of traffic jams in 2023, according to the Federal Statistical Office. To solve the problem, the government has proposed to parliament the financing of six motorway expansion projects that are ready to be implemented. Five of them are in the German-speaking part of the country and one is in the French-speaking region.Parliament approved the plan in September 2023. This prompted a broad alliance led by the Swiss transport association (Verkehrs-Club der Schweiz, VCS) and the environmental group actif-trafiC, acting in the name of climate protection, to launch a referendum on the plan. Dubbed “Stop motorway construction mania”, it received 100,000 signatures in three months – twice the number needed to go to the polls – with the support of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, among others.As part of the 2030 strategic development programme for national roads, the government is launching construction projects worth CHF11.6 billion to ensure that the network keeps running smoothly. Every four years, it submits a development phase to parliament for consultation.The 2023 development phase, against which the referendum has been launched, concerns six motorway expansion projects. In French-speaking Switzerland, the Le Vengeron-Coppet-Nyon axis, linking cantons Geneva and Vaud, is to be widened to two times three lanes over a distance of some 19 kilometres. In German-speaking Switzerland, the Wankdorf-Schönbühl section (in canton Bern) is to be increased from six to eight lanes, and the Schönbühl-Kirchberg section (also in canton Bern) is to be increased from four to six lanes. Three sets of tunnels are also to be doubled: the Fäsenstaub tunnel (canton Schaffhausen), the Rhine tunnel (cantons Basel City and Basel Country) and the Rosenberg tunnel (canton St Gallen).The government wants to increase the capacity and safety of motorways, and remove bottlenecks at strategic points to improve traffic flow. The goal is also to help relieve congestion in surrounding towns and villages. At present, when traffic builds up on the motorway, drivers often divert onto secondary roads, clogging up inhabited areas and harming the quality of life of local residents.As the Swiss population continues to grow, the advocates of building more lanes stress the need to modernise a motorway network that is considered outdated. Increased mobility needs can only be met thanks to appropriate, functional and reliable infrastructure, they stress. Mobility is synonymous with freedom, employment and prosperity, says Peter Goetschi, president of the automobile association Touring Club Switzerland (TCS).Supply security is also at stake, economic circles warn, as motorways play a systemic role in the transport of goods.The road development projects are incompatible with the climate objectives assumed by the Swiss government on ratifying the Paris Agreement, the referendum alliance argues. Road traffic is already responsible for one-third of CO2 emissions in Switzerland. There is therefore an urgent need to think about sustainable mobility and to develop public transport, rather than expanding the motorway network, the Swiss transport association VCS says: the planned expansion is “excessive and outmoded”.Any new road acts as a pull factor – supply creates demand, the projects’ opponents point out. Many are also worried about the “concreting over” of Switzerland, which is ruining the countryside and destroying farmland and forests, biodiversity sites and recreational areas.Above all, the cost of the new infrastructure is deemed “exorbitant” – a real “waste of money”, says the environmental group actif-trafiC. The price of the projects is CHF5.3 billion, not counting the billions that will have to be spent on future maintenance. On top of this, even if the cost of the projects is covered by fuel and vehicle taxes, it is ordinary people who will “bear the external costs of the harm caused by the traffic: accidents, noise, pollution, health problems, climate and environmental impacts”, warns actif-trafiC.The government and parliament are in favour of expanding the motorways. Among the main political groupings, the right-wing parties – first and foremost the Swiss People’s Party – are calling on voters to accept the projects. Unsurprisingly, automobile associations such as the TCS and auto-swiss, as well as business organisations such as the Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts (usam) and economiesuisse, support the plan. Grouped together in an alliance called “Yes to ensuring the future of national roads”, they have already launched a campaign for the vote under the slogan “For a Switzerland that moves forward”.A broad alliance is seeking to halt the expansion of the six planned motorway sections. It includes environmental and climate protection organisations such as Greenpeace, WWF, Climate Alliance Switzerland and BirdLife, as well as the Green Party, the Social Democratic Party, Doctors for the Environment, the Anti-Noise League and farmers‘ organisations such as Uniterre and the Small Farmers’ Association.Edited by Samuel Jaberg.

40,Fed Diverges From Global Peers in New Era of Higher for Longer,"(Bloomberg) — The Federal Reserve’s move to signal fewer interest-rate cuts this year deepens its divergence from peers who have already begun to ease.The message from the Fed was two-fold: Not only are officials now only anticipating one rate cut this year, compared to the three they projected as recently as March, but they also see its easing cycle bottoming out at a higher level than previously expected, underscoring the era of higher rates is set to stay. That’s in contrast with the Bank of Canada, which lowered its benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points to 4.75% last week, making it the first Group of Seven central bank to kick off an easing cycle. The European Central Bank soon followed, lowering its key rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, while the Swiss National Bank made its move to cut in March. For the world economy, divergence from the Fed matters. Higher US interest rates stoke dollar strength and will continue to lure foreign capital away from rival economies, especially emerging ones. The Fed staying on hold raises questions around harmful foreign-exchange volatility and risks undermining progress on getting inflation down, according to analysis by Bloomberg Economics. “The overall theme for western, developed economies is that we’re on the road to cuts but it won’t all happen at once,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “The Fed is not in the lead this time. Last week was historic in that we saw two G-7 central banks cut rates, neither of which was the Fed.”Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did little on Wednesday to encourage bets on a near-term rate cut.“We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell told reporters after keeping policy on hold. “So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.”Policymakers see scope for different paths ahead, suggesting there’s space for divergence before it crosses a threshold that would fuel market volatility.“There are limits to that divergence in interest rates, but we’re not close to that limit,” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on a panel discussion in Montreal on Wednesday.Such a split is only set to bolster the prevailing trend that has grabbed hold of currency markets in 2024: The high relative yields on offer in the US make investing in American assets — and by proxy the dollar — too good to pass up. What Bloomberg Economics Says…“Powell’s signaling that the Fed might hold rates higher for longer prompts questions about how much other major central banks can move forward with rate cuts without stoking harmful exchange-rate volatility and risk undermining progress in getting inflation down. Scenario analysis based on our in-house SHOK model provides answers. Taking the euro as an example, depreciation is likely to have only a small impact on imported inflation. That alone won’t move the dial on ECB policy, though our model shows it remains a channel to watch.”—Simona Delle Chiaie, economist. For full research, click hereSave for Japan, gains have been pronounced against those economies where benchmark rates have since been cut this year. The euro is down more than 2% versus the greenback, the Canadian dollar and Swedish krona more than 3% weaker, and the Swiss franc is lower by almost 6%. The yen weakened in Asian trading on Friday after the Bank of Japan decided to stay put on monetary policy and said it would specify the plan for bond purchases at its next meeting. The decision spurred selling of the yen as investors were primed to expect details on cuts to debt buying. A recent study by Bank of America currency strategists Howard Du and Vadim Iaralov found that this year’s dollar buying — prompted by the relative yield and growth advantage in the US — has largely taken place outside of US hours and been led by investors in Europe and Asia. “You have a central bank dynamic where the Fed relative to most other global central banks is perceived to be more hawkish,” said Nathan Thooft, of Manulife Investment Management. “Eventually the Fed will begin a cutting cycle like everyone else, but our relative rates are starting at a higher level and we’re starting later.”Even if the Fed does cut, the moves will likely be limited given that pockets of inflation remain sticky and well above the 2% target, said Jerome Haegeli, chief economist at Swiss Re, who previously worked at Switzerland’s central bank.“What the market’s short-term thinking misses is the fact that the Fed is likely to cut by much less than what was previously the norm,” he said. “Higher-for-longer remains intact in the US and over time.”Traders see a high chance the Fed will lower rates in September after a key gauge of underlying inflation posted its smallest annual advance in more than three years. And in what may limit the divergence trend, there’s no guarantee that the ECB or others will have scope to move further as policymakers warn that inflation remains a threat.“Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have to be even more stubborn than the inflation,” ECB Governing Council member Joachim Nagel said at the same event as Macklem in Montreal. “This is a similarity that I see.”And the Fed isn’t the only central bank leaning hawkish. The BOJ is facing pressure to tighten as its currency remains weak, while the Reserve Bank of Australia continues to warn of ongoing price pressures. “Of course, the other risk is cutting too soon, with inflation picking up again, and rate cuts having to be reversed,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Which is precisely why the Fed has been very patient in starting its easing cycle.”–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Zoe Schneeweiss.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","June 14, 2024 - 06:01"

42,SNB Sticks With Steady Pace of Rate Cuts to Restrain the Franc,"(Bloomberg) — The Swiss National Bank cut borrowing costs by a quarter point at a third straight meeting and warned of more to come if needed in its attempt to contain the strength of the franc.Despite market speculation that officials in Zurich would follow the US Federal Reserve’s lead with a half-point reduction, they shirked from any acceleration in easing. The interest rate is now 1% after a 25 basis-point move on Thursday that was predicted by most economists surveyed by Bloomberg.“With today’s easing of monetary policy, we are taking the reduction in inflationary pressure into account,” SNB President Thomas Jordan told reporters after his final monetary-policy decision. “Further cuts in the SNB policy rate may become necessary in the coming quarters to ensure price stability over the medium term.”His incoming successor — Martin Schlegel — was even more explicit, telling Bloomberg Television in an interview that while the SNB doesn’t precommit, “we will have an assessment in December again, but from the current junction, it looks like — it is likely that — further cuts could follow.”The outcome balances the SNB’s determination to rein in the currency, whose strength threatens to depress prices and hurt exporters, against its need to conserve ammunition. With one of the world’s lowest rates, the central bank has limited scope to keep reducing it in any extended confrontation with the foreign-exchange market. With a small minority of forecasters predicting either a half-point reduction or no change, the decision presented investors with a three-way cliffhanger. It was the final policy act overseen by Jordan, who surprised markets at pivotal moments in almost 13 years as SNB president.“It would be hard to imagine a more characteristic end to the Thomas Jordan era at the SNB,” said Philipp Burckhardt, a fixed income strategist at Lombard Odier IM. “We now expect the SNB to follow up with at least one more interest rate cut in December. Against this backdrop, neither the current weakness of export partners nor a strengthening Swiss franc are helping.”Market speculation for a larger cut had increased after the Fed’s action last week, and the currency touched a one-month low against the euro on the eve of the decision. The announcement initially boosted the franc, which rose as much as 0.3% to 0.9438 euros as some traders unwound bets on a bigger, 50 basis point cut, before paring gains back to 0.9454.The franc’s rally to its strongest level in nearly a decade has caused a persistent headache for the SNB all year, raising the possibility that it could intervene to stem further gains.What Bloomberg’s Economics Says…“We expect the SNB to use some of the room that remains to deliver another cut in December, taking the rate to 0.75%. Such a move would be somewhat below its estimate of the neutral rate. The central bank will be reticent to cut much further, but it may feel it has to — it said further cuts might be necessary in the coming quarters.”—Jamie Rush and Maeva Cousin. For full react, click hereThe Swiss decision aligns with Europe’s less abrupt approach until now. Since the US move, the Bank of England vowed not to rush further easing, while Sweden’s Riksbank also stuck with a quarter-point pace even while warning that it could speed that up next time.The SNB, which led peers with the first reduction in the current cycle in March, faces the challenge of consumer-price growth that is on a path to weaken further below the ceiling of its target band, toward zero. That would bring it perilously close to the disinflation that troubled Jordan and his colleagues for much of his tenure.“For now, the SNB is likely to exhaust its remaining rate cut space before switching to FX interventions,” said Christian Schulz, an economist at Citigroup. “We still expect that the SNB will at some point have to switch to FX interventions to manage the exchange rate as it cannot ‘outcut’ other central banks and will have to accept shrinking interest rate differentials eventually.”Officials lowered their forecasts for consumer-price growth, and now predict it will average 1.2% this year, 0.6% in 2025 and 0.7% in 2026. The central bank aims to keep it in a range between zero and 2%.Policymakers know from experience that upward market pressure on the franc can be long-lasting, forcing them to respond judiciously. Having already bloated their balance sheet through years of interventions, rates have been their primary weapon in the past couple of years. Avoiding a bigger cut could expose the SNB to further criticism from exporters exposed to swings in the currency, not least because this was also Switzerland’s last scheduled decision before the US election, whose result could cause market tremors. While Swiss industrial activity is subdued, the services sector helped sustain stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter.The central bank sees growth at about 1% this year, before accelerating to around 1.5% in 2025.“Growth is likely to remain rather modest in Switzerland in the coming quarters due to the recent appreciation of the Swiss franc and the moderate development of the global economy,” Jordan said.The SNB chief’s final day in office will be on Monday. He will be succeeded by Schlegel, who has been his deputy for more than two years. The departure will remove one of the remaining veterans of the global financial crisis and its low-rate aftermath from the central banking stage.Jordan said he’d always perceived his job as a “privilege” and thanked the Swiss population for its “great trust” in the institution — “this is absolutely decisive for the national bank.”–With assistance from Alessandro Speciale, Alexander Weber, Paula Doenecke, Kristian Siedenburg, Joel Rinneby and Naomi Tajitsu.(Updates with Schlegel in fourth paragraph.)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","September 26, 2024 - 13:38"
43,Taiwan deputy foreign minister to attend Pacific Islands Forum,"(Corrects spelling and capitalisation of Islands Forum in headline)TAIPEI (Reuters) -A deputy Taiwan foreign minister will attend this week’s meeting of Pacific Islands leaders in Tonga, Taiwan’s foreign ministry said on Sunday, as China and the United States jostle for influence in the region.The Pacific is also an area of competition between Taipei and Beijing, as China whittles away at the number of countries which maintain formal diplomatic relations with Chinese-claimed Taiwan. Three countries – Palau, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands – have stuck with Taiwan.Taiwan’s foreign ministry said Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang would hold a summit with its three Pacific allies to strengthen its partnership with them and other “like-minded countries”, a reference to Western democracies such as the United States and Australia.In January, shortly after Lai Ching-te won election as Taiwan’s new president, Nauru switched ties from Taipei to Beijing, in what Taiwan’s government said was part of a sustained Chinese pressure campaign.In 2018, Nauru, then still a ally of Taiwan’s, blasted an “insolent” China for speaking out of turn at the Pacific Islands Forum. Nauru had recognised China before, between 2002 and 2005.Taiwan has taken part in the forum since 1993 as a development partner under the name o f “Taiwan/Republic of China”. The Republic of China is Taiwan’s formal name.China says democratically governed Taiwan is one of its provinces with no right to state-to-state ties, a position hotly disputed by the government in Taipei.Climate change and security are expected to dominate discussions at this week’s meeting of the 18 Pacific Islands leaders. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell will also be going.Taiwan and Tonga had diplomatic ties from 1972 until 1998 when the country switched recognition to Beijing and broke off relations with Taipei.Only 12 countries now maintain official diplomatic ties with Taiwan.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)","August 25, 2024 - 03:43"
44,"World risks missing deadline for pandemic accord, says WHO chief","GENEVA (Reuters) – Countries risk missing a May deadline for agreeing a legally binding treaty on fighting pandemics, which would be a big blow for future generations, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.The new pact and a series of updates to existing rules on dealing with pandemics are intended to shore up the world’s defences against new pathogens after the COVID-19 pandemic killed more than 7 million people, according to WHO data.“I’m concerned that member states may not meet that commitment and there are several outstanding issues that remain to be resolved,” said Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in an address to the global health agency’s Executive Board meeting in Geneva.“In my view, a failure to deliver the pandemic agreement and the IHR (International Health Regulations) amendments will be a missed opportunity for which future generations may not forgive us,” he said.Only once before in the organisation’s 75-year history has the WHO managed to agree such an accord, and that was a Tobacco Control treaty in 2003.Negotiations of this type usually take seven years, said Roland Driece, co-chair of the group negotiating the agreement, and they have only had two years. Speaking at an informal briefing on Monday, he said it was crucial to make progress now because of the “slipping urgency” around pandemic prevention.Tedros said he was upbeat about prospects for battling HIV/AIDS, however, one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the global body to fight some of the world’s most pressing problems by 2030.“We are now beginning to see a pathway for the SDG target of ending the HIV pandemic,” Tedros said.","January 23, 2024 - 13:13"

, which provides an overview of the current state of the international travel and tourism sector. We spoke to Francisco Betti, co-author of the report, who is part of the WEF Executive Committee and heads the forum’s Global Industries Team.SWI swissinfo.ch: What are the main findings of the 2024 edition of the Travel and Tourism Development Index?Francisco Betti: In 2024, the travel and tourism sector is expected to reach or even exceed pre-pandemic levels. This recent growth is due to the reopening of economies and a rebound in demand for travel and tourism.Of course, the opening of new flights, airports, natural and cultural attractions, etc. has contributed to this recovery. Few people realise that this sector accounts for nearly 10% of the world’s gross national product (GNP) and that it has a significant impact on employment.SWI: What are the main risks facing the industry today?F.B.: Despite its renewed growth, the sector is fragile and faces multiple challenges. I am thinking especially of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as environmental and climate risks. These latter can knock an entire region out of operation”.On top of this digitalisation, including generative artificial intelligence, is shaking up the industry, with the emergence of new players and the exponential growth of online bookings.And lastly, we are seeing that supply cannot keep up with strong demand, because of a shortage of skilled labour, lack of flights and outdated infrastructure.SWI: Is the recovery of the travel and tourism sector more or less uniform across all geographical regions?F.B.: It is very uneven. The top ten places in our ranking are occupied by Western countries as well as Japan and China. In contrast, there are no developing countries at the top of the table. They are improving, but they still lag behind significantly.SWI: Your report uses data mainly from international organisations such as the United Nations. How reliable are these figures?F.B.: We have used the best sources available but, as ever, gathering reliable data is an iterative and interactive process. I know that our sources, for instance the United Nations agencies, go to great lengths to check and harmonise the data.SWI: Switzerland ranks 10th in your index. Its main weakness is its high prices, although this enables it to target a wealthy clientele and prevent overtourism.F.B.: Our report is an innovative tool as it includes not just economic factors but also considerations related to the environment, resilience and the impact on local communities.However, the main purpose of our report is not to establish a ranking and to compare different countries, as each nation operates in its own context. Our main goal is to enable the authorities and the private sector in each country to hold informed discussions and ask themselves the right questions.In the case of Switzerland, being able to target a certain type of tourist is of course a positive aspect. More generally, though, we cannot overlook the fact that price competitiveness is an important factor that must be closely monitored. It can have a negative impact on demand, for example in the event of a rapid appreciation of the Swiss franc.SWI: Your report shows that Switzerland is also relatively weak in terms of natural and cultural resources, lagging far behind Spain, Italy and France. Why is this?F.B.: This is another example where direct comparison can be misleading. Of course, Switzerland has excellent natural and cultural resources and does a great job in promoting them. However, in our report, the size of the country is taken into account. Thus, in terms of natural resources, Switzerland has around 5,000km2 of protected areas, including national parks that can be visited. In comparison, Spain has 270,000km2 and the United States 2.9 million km2.SWI: Does Switzerland nonetheless suffer from occasional overtourism?F.B.: Regarding overtourism, Switzerland’s challenges are not specific to this country. Overtourism is on the whole very localised (as in Lauterbrunnen, Venice, Kyoto, etc.), rather than nationwide. It is also difficult to agree on a quantitative definition of the phenomenon.The main thing is to have an ongoing dialogue between the authorities and local residents, because it is the population that benefits most from tourism, but also suffers most if there are too many visitors.Thanks to such exchange mechanisms, the best possible consensus can be reached. It is important to base any discussions on scientific facts, such as the maximum number of daily visitors that a site can accommodate without being degraded.SWI: If necessary, how can overtourism best be regulated?F.B.: The United Nations suggests several methods for avoiding overtourism, such as applying dynamic pricing mechanisms, creating pedestrian-only zones or using big data to monitor impacts. More generally, the world body recommends a more even homogeneous distribution of visitors over a given geographical area (e.g. a country) or over time; and this is exactly what Switzerland is doing.SWI: One key challenge for Swiss tourism is the lack of skilled workers. What do you recommend to overcome this?F.B.: There is no miracle solution to this serious problem, which affects all developed countries. To attract more workers, the tourism professions need to be made more attractive, by improving working conditions and providing proper training to new recruits.This process takes time, which explains why supply is currently unable to meet demand. As always, a good working relationship between the authorities and the private sector is essential if effective measures are to be put in place.SWI: In Switzerland, many different entities (national, cantonal, municipal, etc.) are involved in promoting tourism. What are the best practices here?F.B.: As I see it, the ideal set-up is the one that best responds to each country’s specific needs. In the case of Switzerland, we are dealing with a very federalised state, a fact that also contributes to its beauty and variety. So I believe that the promotion of tourism in Switzerland should be highly decentralised, but with strong national coordination and the projection of a single, common brand.Generally speaking, national tourism bodies are now clearly more aware of the need to manage visitor flows, promote lesser-known destinations and include all stakeholders to ensure that tourism benefits everyone and respects local culture and nature. In other words, they are no longer content with just doing marketing and attracting tourists.SWI: Will new clean technologies be enough to ensure sustainability, or is a reduction in travel inevitable?F.B.: This balance between growth and sustainability is the challenge of the century. Vast technological advances are underway. I am thinking, for instance, of sustainable fuels for aviation, and hydrogen and electric power. It will still take massive investment and around 20 years to make our sector sustainable but, as a techno-optimist, I firmly believe it can be done.     It is of course vital that all stakeholders contribute in different ways to bring about sustainability, including through substantial investment. This calls for a high degree of coordination, which is why our forum regularly brings together all the key players. Lastly, we must also each do our bit as consumers and travel as responsibly as possible.SWI: Are consumers on the whole prepared to pay more for sustainable solutions?F.B.: More expensive solutions already exist that offset some of the CO2 emissions, and I see some interest in these options, particularly among the younger generations in developed economies.Text edited by Samuel Jaberg.

46,Is Geneva still the capital of peace?,"“Geneva, capital of peace.” The slogan is well known to journalists accredited to the Palais des Nations, the United Nations (UN) office in Geneva. But is it still relevant today? “It’s been a few years since we saw any negotiations here,” laments a colleague, whose work frequently takes him to the Palais.Until 2022, the international press went regularly to the UN’s European headquarters to follow progress in the negotiations on Syria. Since 2015, rounds of talks on Yemen have sporadically attracted strong media interest. In 2020, a ceasefire for Libya was even signed there.Today, however, most of the peace processes under way on the shores of Lake Geneva seem to have stalled. This may be blamed on unsuccessful multilateral diplomacy, but also Russia’s efforts to boycott Geneva.Moscow, which no longer considers Switzerland to be neutral since the start of the war in Ukraine, obtained the suspension of talks on Syria, a close Russian ally, in 2022. In April of this year the Kremlin threatened to move negotiations on Georgia, usually held within the UN, to another country.Geneva is also feeling the brunt of geopolitical changes, including a recalibration of the international order – from west to east, and from north to south. Other countries and capitals also want to pull their weight on the world stage.The era of the major meetings, for which Geneva is renowned, appears to be over. The 2021 summit between US and Russian presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin was nothing like the 1985 one between US and Soviet leaders Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, held in the midst of the Cold War. The 2021 meeting was a “non-event”, according to a well-informed source who prefers to remain anonymous.The organisations of International Geneva, which also hosts the headquarters of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, are largely based on a world order established after the Second World War. This order, dominated by the United States, is now being challenged by China and Russia, as well as certain African and South American countries.“If this world order loses its dominance, clearly Switzerland and Geneva will also lose their importance,” says Daniel Warner, former deputy director of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID). “And the blockages in the Security Council are tarnishing the UN’s image as a peace negotiator, which has an impact on International Geneva.”As the main body responsible for maintaining world peace, the Security Council in New York is paralysed in most conflicts because of the veto rights of its five permanent members and rivalries between the major powers.“In the past, when people wanted to meet to negotiate peace, they immediately thought of Geneva. This seems no longer to be the case,” laments Georges Martin, a former Swiss diplomat and former number three at the Swiss foreign ministry. “There is a negative dynamic. And as Geneva loses its influence, other countries are happy to take its place.”Thus, the agreement on Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea was signed in Istanbul, with Turkish mediation. Qatar, meanwhile, recently hosted negotiations on a possible ceasefire in Gaza.While geographical or political proximity may explain these states’ entry onto the diplomatic stage, Martin believes it is also a consequence of the Swiss government’s foreign policy, which, he says, is damaging the country’s reputation of neutrality.Swiss neutrality has always been one of Geneva’s main assets as a meeting place for warring parties. But Switzerland has struggled to assert this neutrality on the international stage since the resumption of European sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.For the past two years, the Kremlin has repeatedly stated that it no longer considers the country to be neutral. In March, its representative to the UN in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, announced that Moscow would not take part in the conference on the Ukrainian peace plan that Switzerland will hold in June at the Bürgenstock resort above Lake Lucerne. Russia has so far not been invited to the talks.It is, however, not the first time the Swiss government has adopted sanctions outside the UN to punish a state for violating international law. Switzerland sanctioned Libya in 2011, for instance.Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza on October 7, the Swiss government has taken several decisions that part of the Swiss political class considers contradictory to the country’s humanitarian and neutrality traditions.In January the government temporarily suspended its funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), after Israel accused some of the organisation’s employees of involvement in the Hamas attack on the country.Last November Bern also decided to ban Hamas in Switzerland, thus making it more difficult for the parties involved in the Middle East conflict to negotiate on Swiss soil.Some critical voices, particularly in the academic world, argue that Switzerland, the depositary of the Geneva Conventions, took too long to firmly denounce Israel’s violations of the laws of war in Gaza.“I know that at the UN in New York, and beyond, people are asking: where is Switzerland? What does it think? What is its policy? We’ve lost credibility, clarity and predictability,” former Swiss diplomat Martin insists. “Switzerland is perceived less as a peacemaker, and this inevitably has repercussions on Geneva.”According to Martin, the stormy debates in parliament on the possibility of re-exporting Swiss weapons to Ukraine, on the use of interest from Russian assets frozen in Switzerland, and on funding for UNRWA are the result of a lack of leadership by Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, in office since 2017, in explaining the Swiss government’s positions to the members of parliament.This criticism is contested by Laurent Wehrli, Radical-Liberal parliamentarian and president of the foreign policy committee. “I don’t feel that my colleagues don’t know what the government’s positions are,” he says. In his view, foreign policy is currently “polarised”, with part of the right and the left hijacking foreign policy issues to serve domestic political interests.Moreover, Wehrli adds, International Geneva has “if anything, gained” in recent years, thanks to parliament’s decisions to finance the renovation of the headquarters of some organisations and the development of digital governance. “These are concrete examples that show that Mr Cassis and the government have succeeded in explaining to parliament the importance of International Geneva,” he stresses.Meanwhile, Carlo Sommaruga, a Social Democrat senator from canton Geneva and vice-president of the foreign policy committee, is critical of Cassis’s policy, which included dropping the Geneva Initiative on the Middle East. Yet he says he is not worried about the consequences on the role of International Geneva more broadly.“Geneva is still an attractive venue. With everything it has to offer, many players still come here,” he says. “It is important to distinguish between International Geneva as a platform that Switzerland can provide as a host state for conferences, where it is not necessarily a player, and Switzerland’s mediation role.” This role, Sommaruga stresses, is currently out of the question with regard to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.While the political UN is suffering, with negative repercussions for Geneva, its technical agencies are doing “relatively well”, according to Michael Møller, former UN director in Geneva. Some 40 of them, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), are headquartered in Geneva. Their respective roles are to promote health, working conditions around the world and access to the web.According to Møller, these organisations have rarely done as important a job as they do today.“Making peace is not just about sitting down and trying to put a stop to the fighting. Put simply, it means implementing all the sustainable development goals,” he stresses. This is a reference to the 17 goals that the world community has set itself, in particular to eradicate poverty and combat climate change.“We need to move away from the traditional way of thinking about peace and approach it more broadly.” Møller believes that peace cannot come about as long as inequalities persist, whether in terms of access to healthcare, education, work or a healthy environment. These are all fields in which International Geneva is actively working.“Most peace negotiations take place behind the scenes,” Møller adds, and countries in conflict continue to meet in Geneva “very discreetly, without anyone knowing”.This confidential dialogue takes place at the UN, but also within private mediation organisations, such as the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP). These structures help organise meetings between players who wish to talk to each other outside official channels, enabling a dialogue that is particularly useful when formal diplomacy is not possible.“So-called private diplomats have filled a certain void,” confirms David Harland, the executive director of HD and a former New Zealand diplomat.This is how the idea behind one of the rare successes of diplomacy in Ukraine was born in Geneva, at HD – the Black Sea grain initiative, which was concluded in 2022 under the aegis of the UN and Turkey and then abandoned by Moscow last summer. Meanwhile, the GCSP has kept channels of communication open by organising discreet meetings in Geneva between Russians and Ukrainians.Edited by Virginie Mangin/sj.

47,Russia to build Central Asia’s first nuclear power plant in Uzbekistan,"TASHKENT (Reuters) -Russia will build a small nuclear power plant in Uzbekistan, the first such project in post-Soviet Central Asia, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said on Monday at a meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin.The nuclear deal, if implemented, will showcase Russia’s ability to export not only energy, but also high-tech products to new Asian markets, at a time when the West is increasing pressure on it through sanctions.Mirziyoyev also said Tashkent was interested in buying more oil and gas from Russia, a reversal of decades-long practice where Moscow imported hydrocarbons from Central Asia.The Uzbek president described Putin’s visit as “historic”.“It heralds the beginning of a new age in the comprehensive strategic partnership and alliance relations between our countries,” he said.Putin also called Tashkent Moscow’s “strategic partner and reliable ally”.According to documents published by the Kremlin, Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom will build up to six nuclear reactors with a capacity of 55 megawatts each in Uzbekistan, a much smaller-scale project than the 2.4 gigawatts one agreed in 2018 which remains to be finalised.There are no nuclear power plants in any of the five ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, although Uzbekistan and its neighbour Kazakhstan, both uranium producers, have long said their growing economies needed them.The Kazakh project, however, can only move ahead after a national referendum which has not yet been scheduled.“Nearly all the leading countries of the world ensure their energy security and sustainable development with the help of nuclear energy,” Mirziyoyev said.ENERGY SUPPLIESTaking advantage of Russia’s campaign to redirect its gas exports to Asia amid a rift with the West over Ukraine, Uzbekistan last October started importing Russian natural gas via the same pipeline which had previously pumped it in the reverse direction.Although its own gas production remains substantial at about 50 billion cubic metres a year, Uzbekistan struggles to fully meet domestic demand, and Russian supplies have allowed it to avert an energy crisis.“(Gas) exports are running well ahead of schedule and we are ready to increase their volume if needed,” Putin said.According to Mirziyoyev, Tashkent is also keen to increase imports of Russian oil.The two leaders also said their governments were working on large projects in mining, metals, and chemicals.Uzbekistan, whose economy depends heavily on remittances from migrant labourers working in Russia, has maintained close ties with Moscow after it invaded Ukraine in 2022.However, Mirziyoyev and other leaders in the region have never spoken in support of what the Kremlin calls its special military operation in Ukraine, and all countries in the region are also working with the West on projects such as cargo shipping routes designed to bypass Russia.(Reporting by Mukhammadsharif Mamatkulov; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Mark Potter)","May 27, 2024 - 16:18"
48,"Japan must strengthen NATO ties to safeguard global peace, PM says","By Yukiko Toyoda, John GeddieTOKYO (Reuters) -Russia’s deepening military cooperation with North Korea has underlined the need for Japan to forge closer ties with NATO as regional security threats become increasingly intertwined, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told Reuters. In written remarks ahead of his attendance at a NATO summit in Washington DC this week, Kishida also signalled concern over Beijing’s alleged role in aiding Moscow’s two-year-old war in Ukraine, although he did not name China.“The securities of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are inseparable, and Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and its deepened military cooperation with North Korea are strong reminders of that,” Kishida said.“Japan is determined to strengthen its cooperation with NATO and its partners,” he added.The world, the Japanese leader said, should not tolerate attempts by some countries to disrupt the established international order and reiterated a warning that Ukraine today could be East Asia tomorrow. He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with NATO leaders. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defence pledge with Russia last month during President Valdimir Putin’s first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his “full support” for Russia’s war in Ukraine.The U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea’s nuclear missile development.Washington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party. Without naming China, Kishida told Reuters “some countries” have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia which has served “as a lifeline” for its Ukraine war.“It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fuelling Russia’s attempt to change the status quo by force,” he said.“The geographical boundary of ‘Euro-Atlantic’ or ‘Indo-Pacific’ is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.”Constrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine. It has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO’s fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems. Tokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.“This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,” he said.There may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticised by China.(Reporting by Yukiko Toyoda and John Geddie; Editing by Michael Perry)","July 9, 2024 - 14:59"
49,Swiss CFOs much more optimistic despite global uncertainty,"More than half (56%) of over 120 CFOs of Swiss companies surveyed expect the economy to develop positively over the next 12 months, according to the semi-annual CFO survey published on Wednesday by consulting firm Deloitte. This is 15 percentage points more than last autumn.Around 38% of survey participants also rate expectations for Switzerland as neutral and 6% as negative. According to Deloitte, the outlook is therefore “solidly positive, but not euphoric”. CFOs are even more confident about the economy in the US.By contrast, expectations for trading partners Germany (66% negative or very negative) and China (47% negative or very negative) are far more pessimistic than for Switzerland and the US. While the assessment for Germany remained more or less stable compared to autumn, expectations for China have at least brightened slightly.A trend is thus emerging whereby the outlook for Switzerland and other important trading partners is brightening, while the forecast for Germany remains extremely pessimistic. Alessandro Miolo, head of Audit & Assurance at Deloitte Switzerland, concludes that if the forecasts for Germany are confirmed, the Swiss export industry will have to increase its involvement in other markets.+ What the EU crackdown on supply chains means for Swiss companiesThe CFOs are also optimistic about their own company, at least half of them. Only 16% are rather worried about the future; 63% expect turnover to rise in the next 12 months and 39% also expect margins to increase.However, around a quarter of them expect the number of employees in their own company to fall, either due to redundancies or vacancies that are not filled. This percentage has now risen for the second time in a row.This can partly be explained by the fact that companies do not expect to find suitable skilled labour within a reasonable period of time. The labour shortage remains a major problem for many companies.+ Labour shortage remains acute in SwitzerlandOn the other hand, the areas of artificial intelligence and automation continue to gain in importance. According to the study, this is resulting in a lower willingness to hire and a shrinking workforce. This is also reflected in figures from the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), which recently reported a decrease in job vacancies and is forecasting rising unemployment for the current year.Geopolitical risks have risen spectacularly from tenth to first place in the finance directors’ worry barometer. However, the autumn survey took place even before the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. The feeling of an increasingly uncertain world is also reflected in corporate concerns in view of the Middle East conflict, the war in Ukraine, tensions between Taiwan and China and the uncertain outcome of the US elections.Concerns about regulation have also moved to the forefront, rising 11 places to fourth place. In this context, the CFOs mentioned regulations in the area of sustainability (ESG) for the first time. The increasing number and variety of regulatory requirements increased the time and costs involved, resulting in a conflict of objectives with regard to corporate requirements.The survey was conducted between March 5 and April 5, 2024; 121 CFOs took part.Translated from German by DeepL/ts","May 1, 2024 - 10:38"
50,"Exclusive-India’s Modi, chasing reform legacy, shifts income goals for struggling farmers","By Shivangi Acharya and Sarita Chaganti SinghMATHURA, India (Reuters) – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has drawn up new targets to boost farmer incomes as he seeks to secure his legacy of reforming the world’s largest democracy and tries to assuage a key voting bloc disillusioned by his government’s past failures.Modi, who is eyeing a rare third term in ongoing elections, wants to lift rural per-capita income by 50% by 2030, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.He plans to raise incomes in the hinterland by increasing corporate investments in agriculture to 25% of the overall investment in the sector from 15% now and increase non-farm jobs through strengthening small scale industries, the documents prepared by Modi’s administration show.Modi’s focus on reforming the agricultural sector and improving the rural standard of living is crucial to sustain India’s fastest growing tag without increasing inequality between urban and rural Indians that has worsened during his term.“While agriculture occupies a shrinking share of India’s GDP, it still accounts for more than 40% of the labour force,” Milan Vaishnav, an expert on South Asian politics and economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank.“I think Modi’s economic legacy will hinge, at least in part, on what happens to this large share of rural dwellers.”But having failed to double farmer incomes by 2022 as promised in 2016 during his first tenure, the new targets are less ambitious and are likely to face scepticism in many parts of the rural community.Modi’s last big reform push was met with violent protests by farmers that forced him to repeal three farm laws in 2021 aimed at increasing corporate participation and deregulating the sector that accounts for about 20% of the economy.Modi has set out a broad plan for the country of 1.4 billion to become a developed nation by 2047 when it will mark 100 years of freedom from British rule, and transformation of the farm sector is key to that objective.By then, Modi wants corporate investments in agriculture to jump to more than 40% by 2047 which will aid mechanized farming, help develop more warehouses, cold storage facilities and food processing units.FAILED PROMISESThe new targets, however, are seen by many farmers spoken to by Reuters in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha as tough to achieve.“Forget about doubling our incomes, they are in decline,” 32-year old Sanjay Kumar said while sitting besides his wheat at an auction market in the ancient city of Mathura in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. “Input costs for farming have increased, but the rise in prices for our crops are not commensurate. How will incomes rise?”Rural wages have indeed stagnated during Modi’s rule. Real rural wages growth was around 1% in 2023 after contracting nearly 3% in the previous two years, according to credit rating agency ICRA, while salary growth in urban areas was about 10%.“Modi ji is always talking a big game, making all these promises and painting these grand pictures for us,” said Kishore Patil, a cotton farmer in the western state of Maharashtra, using a term of respect for the leader. “But when it comes down to it, he never follows through.”Opinion polls had predicted Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies could win up to three-fourths of parliament’s 543 seats at stake, but lacklustre voter turnout is creating doubts about the outcome.There are no term limits for the prime minister but this could be Modi’s final tenure in office if he sticks to an unwritten party rule that calls for leaders to quit public office after the age of 75. Modi turns 74 in September.Emails seeking comments from the prime minister’s office, and the ministries of finance, agriculture, information and broadcasting and were not answered.CORPORATE FEARSFarmers are also sceptical about plans to increase corporate participation in the sector.“With a system with companies around, we are fearful that if anything goes wrong, we will lose control of our land and our crops,” said Arun Kumar, a wheat farmer in Mathura.The government “should explain things to us properly so that we are aware of the pros and cons of higher corporate investments,” Kumar added.The documents did not show if the government had plans to bring back the farm laws to increase corporate investment in the sector.“Farm laws are neither necessary nor sufficient to solve the agricultural problem,” said Rathin Roy, an economist and former adviser to Modi.Raising corporate investments will not automatically turn the sector profitable, and as an initial step the government should get “hard commercial information” on agriculture, reduce its price interventions and avoid sudden policy changes, Roy said.As incomes fell, farmers hit the streets again earlier this year seeking legal guarantees for government minimum support prices (MSP) for all their crops.During Modi’s 10 year rule, MSP for rice and wheat rose 67% and 63%, respectively, versus 138% and 122% over the previous decade, government data showed.What’s more, Modi banned exports of wheat, rice and onions when prices rose to contain domestic inflation, which hurt farmer incomes. Last week, India lifted its ban on onion exports ahead of voting in key onion-growing areas.“Whenever there is a chance to get a good rate, Modi ji comes in and stops exports. So is this the government doing good work?”, said farmer Meera Singh, 38. “Not one thing they have got right.”The opposition Congress party has also made promises to better farmer incomes in their manifesto for the ongoing elections.Congress has said it will add legal guarantees to the MSP, waive farmer loans and dole out annual cash handouts of 100,000 rupees to unemployed youth and poor women.Modi’s manifesto includes plans to raise MSP for crops and strengthen infrastructure to attract investments and create jobs.“I do not doubt their intentions but it has to be implemented in the ground,” said Dilleswar Pradhan, a paddy farmer in Odisha.($1 = 83.3200 Indian rupees)","May 8, 2024 - 08:07"
51,Russia calls on BRICS partners to create alternative to IMF,"(Corrects Oct. 10 story to remove Saudi Arabia as a member of BRICS. Saudi Arabia has been invited to join, but is not currently a member)MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia, which chairs the BRICS group this year, has called on its partners to create an alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to counter political pressure from Western nations ahead of the BRICS summit later this month.BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Top BRICS finance and central bank officials are meeting in Moscow this week.Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who is hosting the meeting, said the global financial system is controlled by Western countries and that the group, which represents 37% of the global economy, needs to create an alternative.“The IMF and the World Bank are not performing their roles. They are not working in the interests of BRICS countries,” Siluanov said at an event on the first day of the meeting.“It is necessary to form new conditions or even new institutions, similar to the Bretton Woods institutions, but within the framework of our community, within the framework of BRICS,” Siluanov added.Russia had its forex reserves in dollars and euros frozen and its financial system heavily hit by sanctions by the West after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The country is cut off from international capital markets.Russia has recently also experienced delays in international transactions with its trading partners, including BRICS member countries, as banks in these countries fear punitive actions from Western regulators.Russia’s central bank Governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has previously talked about a BRICS Bridge payments system, which would link member countries’ financial systems, but progress has been slow.The only financial institution the BRICS countries have established so far is the New Development Bank, created in 2015 to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS members and other emerging economies.(Reporting by Gleb Bryanski; editing by David Evans)","October 14, 2024 - 15:22"
52,Explainer: Will the India-EFTA pact be a ‘game-changer’?,"On March 10, India signed a wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA)
External link
with the four members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA): Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This followed 21 rounds of talks over 16 years.The four small European nations have committed to invest $100 billion (CHF87.6 billion) in the South Asian country and help create a million jobs over 15 years. There is huge potential. Last year India became the world’s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people. It has an expanding middle class and is currently the fastest-growing major economy (8.4% economic growth at the end of 2023).In return, India says it will lift, or partially remove, very high customs duties on 95.3% of industrial imports, excluding gold, either immediately or over time.India and the four EFTA states now need to ratify the accord before it can take effect, with Switzerland planning to do so by next year.In global terms, Switzerland and India are not major trading partners. Bilateral trade stood at CHF17.7 billion in 2023 (provisional figure). Currently, Swiss exports to India are mainly precious metals, machinery, pharmaceuticals and chemicals; imports are mostly chemicals, textiles, precious metals and agricultural products.But the deal is expected to ease access for companies to India’s vast market. Currently more than 300 Swiss firms such as Nestle, Holcim, Sulzer and Novartis operate there.Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) says

future opportunities for Swiss firms exist in the areas of infrastructure, construction, luxury goods, digitalisation, clean tech and electromobility.Swiss manufacturers and exporters of machine tools and other engineering products, high-end watches, chocolate, processed food and beverages could also benefit, alongside the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries.Sectors such as dairy, soya, coal and “sensitive agricultural products” will be excluded, however. EFTA’s biggest export to India by far is gold, mostly from Switzerland. New Delhi said the duty on this would remain untouched.On his return home Swiss Economics Minister Guy Parmelin could not hide his joy, declaring the pact would give Swiss firms a “competitive edge” for many years.“It’s historic. India was perhaps the missing element in our network of free trade agreements. It enables us to diversify,” he told Swiss public television, RTS. Eliminating customs duties will generate around CHF170 million a year in additional exports, he added.Martin Hirzel, president of Swissmem, the umbrella organisation for the mechanical and electrical engineering sectors, called it a “game-changer”. He says it comes at the right time ahead of a possible India-European Union free trade deal.“We now have an overpriced Swiss franc that represents a huge challenge for firms. We are experiencing an industrial recession and the number of new orders is declining. Now we have a 20% remission of customs duties in India. We’ve become competitive again overnight,” he told Swiss public television, SRF.But Thomas Cottier, a retired commercial law professor at the University of Bern, was more circumspect.“I don’t think it’ll be a game-changer,” he told SRF. “It’ll certainly result in a growth in trade with India. But we’re already starting at a modest level of 3.7% in 2022; that will possibly rise to 4-5%.”On the Indian side, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the signing a “watershed”.“This landmark pact underlines our commitment to boosting economic progress and creating opportunities for our youth. The times ahead will bring more prosperity and mutual growth as we strengthen our bonds with EFTA nations,” Modi posted on X.India said the pact would boost exports in areas such as IT, business services, education, pharmaceuticals, garments, chemicals and machinery. But the main focus is on investments. Government officials hope the FTA would give impetus to Modi’s “Make in India

” initiative to boost investment and jobs, especially in the automobile, food processing, railway and financial sectors.Modi’s government is seen to be taking advantage of India’s growing appeal as a fast-growing economy and an alternative to China for global supply chains to secure a number of FTAs. India has now signed four in quick succession since 2021. Switzerland and EFTA are the first European FTA partners. India is also in discussions with the UK, the European Union and Australia for free trade pacts.The EFTA deal comes days before Modi is due to announce dates for a national election.Analysts said the EFTA pact may not immediately help India to reduce its large trade gap with EFTA but will help attract investment into key industries.“The trade agreement will help attract investment in critical sectors like medical devices, clean energy and expand exports to other countries by accessing Swiss and Norwegian technologies,” trade economist Ram Singh, who heads the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, a New Delhi thinktank, told Reuters.The agreement must still be greenlighted by Switzerland’s parliament. An approval procedure will be launched soon so that it can be ratified by 2025 at the latest.While it was hailed by Swiss business leaders and centre-right politicians, parliamentarians on the left still have questions.“Investments can be a driver for sustainable development and good jobs. But they can also be a disadvantage if the money is invested in coal mining or tropical deforestation. So we’ll need conditions [in the deal] to prevent these kinds of things,” Social Democrat Fabian Molina told SRF.If major political differences persist, the agreement could be challenged in a national referendum in Switzerland, like the free trade accord with Indonesia which narrowly survived a vote in March 2021.In a nod to the Swiss pharmaceuticals industry, the government said the accord includes “improvements” to intellectual property rights, patent procedures and the protection of “Swissness”. But the Swiss pharma industry’s welcome has been cautious.“In principle, we support the conclusion of new free trade agreements,” said Stephan Mumenthaler, head of Scienceindustries, the umbrella organisation for the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and life sciences sectors. But it’s too early for a definitive assessment of the text, the group says. “It’s important that the protection of intellectual property is duly guaranteed and that the parties undertake to respect the standards established at international level,” it added.Public Eye, a Swiss NGO that closely followed the trade talks, in particular health issues, was also reserved.“On the one hand, the worst has been avoided with the renunciation of an automatic extension of monopolies linked to intellectual property, such as the extension of the duration of patents or the exclusivity of regulatory data, which Switzerland had long been calling for,” the NGO’s health policy expert Patrick Durisch told Le Temps newspaper. “This would have delayed the market entry of cheaper generic medicines in India, but also in many other poor countries that depend on them.”But the text contains problematic aspects that go beyond World Trade Organization (WTO) standards, aimed at weakening public health safeguards against unmerited and abusive patents and thereby jeopardising the right to health, he added.Edited by Reto Gysi von Wartburg/tsDo you want to read our weekly top stories?

53,Fed Drives Global Push to Cut Rates Despite Questions Over 2025,"(Bloomberg) — With the last traces of the global inflation shock fading, the shift toward lower borrowing costs is about to maintain momentum as economies tread toward a new year fraught with unknowns.Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.Now that the US Federal Reserve has joined rich-world peers with its own initial interest-rate cut, lingering worries about consumer prices are increasingly poised to give way to concerns about growth around the world, according to Bloomberg Economics.Its aggregate gauge of advanced-economy borrowing costs shows a decline of almost 40 basis points between now and the end of the year, and a further drop totaling more than double that amount by the time 2025 is out. While the Fed will now take charge of the global easing push, the shift lower is likely to be widespread, with most of the rest of the Group of Seven staying on board, and even holdouts such as Norway and Australia likely to join in, in due course.But unanswered questions are haunting the outlook, with the US election in November key among them. It’s hard to guess just how different Donald Trump taking office in January might be from Kamala Harris, but — fully implemented — his policies on tax, tariffs and immigration would have major implications for the US economy — and so also for the Fed.Whatever happens, a sustained period of central bank activism, in contrast to the recent hiatus of higher-for-longer rates, is likely to take hold. Out of 23 institutions focused on here, just three are anticipated to leave borrowing costs unchanged over the coming three months, and every one of them is forecast to tweak them in some way by the end of 2025.And while monetary easing is the prevailing theme, some countries are likely to see tightening instead — not least with Japan seen hiking its rate again, and Brazil doing so too.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Fed’s half-point move and the PBOC’s surprise stimulus mean the narrative on central banks has shifted from inflation-crushing hikes to market-boosting cuts. The BOJ heading in the other direction — and all that means for the yen carry trade — is a major cross current. The second may come from the US election. If delivered, Trump’s campaign pledges on taxes, tariffs, and deportations would shift the trajectory for the economy, and force the Fed into another course correction.”—Tom Orlik, global chief economistHere is Bloomberg’s guide to the outlook for central banks that set rates for a combined 90% of the global economy.GROUP OF SEVENUS Federal ReserveWith the Fed’s first rate cut in years finally out of the way, investors have turned their focus to what the size and pace of additional reductions could look like in the fourth quarter and beyond.While the central bank began with a bigger-than-usual move of a half point, Chair Jerome Powell has said that offcials shouldn’t be expected to continue at that pace, and that they would be “recalibrating policy down over time.” They anticipate lowering rates by another half point this year, and an additional full percentage point over 2025, according to the median projection released in September. But policymakers are split, with a large minority seeing a quarter point or less of further cuts in 2024. Officials have continued to emphasize that the path ahead will depend on incoming economic data. They have said they are keen to prevent a cooldown in the US labor market from intensifying, while monitoring inflation for continued progress down towards the central bank’s 2% goal. The outcome of the US presidential election in November will likely stir up conversations about how Fed personnel could change during the next administration, given that Powell’s term as chair ends in 2026. Republican contender Trump has already said he wouldn’t reappoint Powell, while Democratic nominee Harris has yet to comment publicly on the question.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Fed cut rates 50 basis points in September and we expect 50 basis points more cuts this year – including 25 basis points at both the November and December meetings — and another 100 basis points in 2025. We expect unemployment to rise to 4.5% before end-2024, exceeding the median FOMC view of 4.4%, and 5.0% in 2025. If that overshoot occurs before the last FOMC meeting of the year, there’s a decent chance the November or December cut could be 50 basis points.”—Anna WongEuropean Central BankWith the euro-area economy showing waning momentum, investors are increasingly betting on the ECB reduce borrowing costs again this month. That would quicken rate cuts from the quarterly pace that policymakers led by President Christine Lagarde adopted for the first two moves of this easing cycle.Adding to the argument for such a move is a slowdown in inflation last month to below the 2% target for the first time since mid-2021.Officials do predict a reaceleration in price growth the next few months, and some worry that it won’t be sustainably at the ECB’s goal until late-2025. Hawks warn that wage growth — and, as a result, services prices — still pose upside risks. Such concerns could yet persuade policymakers to wait until December.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The ECB will probably reduce rates by 25 basis points in October before cutting again in December by the same amount. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are swiftly abating and survey data indicate the economy is losing momentum. Add in Germany’s industrial malaise and resistance to additional monetary easing from the hawks on the Governing Council seems to have faded.”—David PowellBank of JapanThe key question for the Bank of Japan this quarter is whether it will raise borrowing costs in December. Governor Kazuo Ueda has recently stressed that he has time to consider the next hike, but he’ll increase rates if the economy performs in line with the BOJ’s outlook. That’s been perceived as a signal that there will be no policy move in October, although December remains an open question.Former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba just became Japan’s next prime minister, a development that provides relief for the BOJ after he narrowly beat out an opponent who said a rate hike now would be “stupid.” Still, Governor Ueda will is losing the support of current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who handpicked him last year. BOJ watchers will be closely following whether Ueda can build a cordial relationship with Japan’s new leader, given the bank’s history with political pressure.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The BOJ is slow-walking its next rate hike, waiting to see how the US economy holds up. Come January, it will be ready to deliver a series of increases. With wages and prices heating up, and rates in very simulative territory, inflation will stick around its 2% target — giving it the go-ahead. We see three 25-bp hikes next year — in January, April and July — taking the rate up to 1.0% from 0.25%.”—Taro KimuraBank of EnglandVoting against a second rate cut in September, the BOE signaled it’s not letting the foot off the brake just yet. Officials vowed to take a cautious approach on the way down, stressing that policy has to remain “restrictive for sufficiently long.”The economic recovery is losing momentum, while sticky inflation gauges are cooling down. Minimum wage increases could complicate matters if they heat up pay growth next year.A November move is still on the table. By then, the BOE will have updated forecasts and the new Labour government’s October budget at hand.The BOE is due to give an update of its shake-up after Ben Bernanke’s review of its forecasting and messaging by the end of this year. It will then start implement these changes, phasing them in gradually.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Sticky services inflation and the prospect of a fiscal loosening in the upcoming budget are likely to mean the BOE is cautious about how quickly it cuts rates going forward. We expect rates to be lowered again in November and for the BOE to stick to a quarterly pace through 2025. Signs of a slowing global economy suggest the risks are tilted toward the central bank moving more quickly than we expect.”—Dan Hanson Bank of CanadaThe Bank of Canada has achieved a major milestone in its fight against inflation — yearly price gains decelerated to the central bank’s 2% target in August. Still, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers told Bloomberg that while that’s welcome news, the bank wants to see more progress on core inflation measures, and said the bank still needs to “stick the landing.”At the September meeting, Governor Tiff Macklem told reporters that the governing council discussed scenarios wherein the central bank could either slow or accelerate the pace of rate cuts depending on the outlook for inflation and economic growth. Markets put the odds of a half percentage point cut at about a coinflip for the October 23 meeting, but there’s still key employment and inflation reports to come that will guide whether the central bank needs to break from a gradual pace of monetary easing in order to prevent a hard landing scenario.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Rapidly waning price pressures have allowed the Bank of Canada to maintain a steadier rate-cut pace than we expected. Weak first-half private-sector activity and headline inflation at the BoC’s 2.0% target allow policymakers to move faster toward the neutral rate — perhaps even before elections are scheduled. But with immigration driving population growth, swift rate cuts could reinvigorate home prices, risking a secondary inflation surge.”—Stuart PaulBRICS CENTRAL BANKSPeople’s Bank of ChinaThe PBOC issued the biggest round of stimulus for the economy last month since the pandemic, including lowering the one-year policy rate by the most ever and promising another cut in a shorter-term rate that officials increasingly favor. The move, made amid growing anxiety among the official ranks and malaise among consumers (as well as notable downward revisions of economic growth from Wall Street) is likely not enough to boost growth long-term.The challenges faced by authorities remain the same: households that are still holding back spending and deflation that threatens investment and sentiment.Going forward, the central bank has more room to cut without incurring currency risk, now that the Fed has begun an easing cycle. Economists broadly expect officials to do just that, using monetary policy in addition to fiscal tools in tackling the economic malaise.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The People’s Bank of China’s stimulus package is eye-popping — ranging from cuts to rates and reserve requirements to providing liquidity to stock investors. Each step is significant. Delivering them together is unusual and speaks to the urgency felt in Beijing to head off deflationary risks and get growth on track for the 5% target.”—Chang ShuReserve Bank of IndiaThe Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep its key rate unchanged at 6.5% in its October 7-9 policy review as inflation will probably climb back again to cross its target 4% in September, after staying below the mark in July and August.While nearly 20 months of high borrowing cost has slowed inflation, Governor Shaktikanta Das wants to see more signs of price gains settling around the central bank’s target on a sustainable basis before considering a rate cut. Voting for a reduction will also be difficult for the new members in the Monetary Policy Committee who succeed the three external members after their terms end on October 4. As such, most economists do not expect a pivot before December.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBI’s hawkish hold has run out of reasons. Since its August review, 2Q GDP has surprised down, inflation has eased below target and Fed’s 50-bp cut has widened the policy rate differential. This should prompt the RBI to adopt a neutral stance and cut 25-bp in October on abating capital outflow fears. We see the RBI lowering its inflation outlook to 4.3% for fiscal 2025 from 4.5%, but keeping its growth outlook at 7.2% on prospects of a stronger rural recovery.”—Abhishek GuptaCentral Bank of BrazilBrazil’s central bank just lifted its rate for the first time since 2022, and investors now expect policymakers to accelerate a tightening campaign that is seen extending into early next year.Latin America’s largest economy is growing above its potential, forcing policymakers to buck a global wave of monetary easing. A tight labor market is pressuring service costs as board members warn the disinflation process has been “interrupted.” Adding to those concerns, investors are questioning President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s commitment to a balanced budget, with greater public spending reinforcing bets of higher borrowing costs ahead.Outgoing Governor Roberto Campos Neto has refrained from providing guidance, and he will soon be replaced by Monetary Policy Director Gabriel Galipolo, pending Senate approval.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The BCB pointed to strong demand and a tight labor market when it hiked rates, but we think the main reason was to build an inflation-fighting reputation for incoming head Galipolo and other Lula-appointed board members. If that’s the case, the hike cycle will likely extend at least through Galipolo’s first few meetings in charge, with 25-basis-point moves. We see a peak rate of 11.75% in March, before gradual easing starts around midyear.”—Adriana DupitaBank of RussiaThe Bank of Russia may return its key rate to the 20% level last reached in an emergency increase following President Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. After hiking by 100 basis points to 19% in September, Governor Elvira Nabiullina said underlying inflation remains “intolerably high” and held open the prospect of a further increase at the bank’s Oct. 25 meeting.She noted that declining oil prices linked to slowing global economic growth are “pro-inflationary” for Russia. With price growth still running at more than double the 4% target, Nabiullina said the bank would keep monetary conditions tight “for as long as necessary” to return inflation to the goal in 2025.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Bank of Russia’s policy rate will peak by the end of 2024, possibly as high as 22%. The central bank’s guidance remains markedly hawkish as the institution is struggling to rebuild credibility dented by five years of inflation running above the 4% target.The central bank’s task is complicated by growing public spending. The government is focused on boosting military recruitment and industry output, which is keeping the fiscal impulse strong.”—Alexander IsakovSouth African Reserve BankA strong currency, softer oil prices, and an improved inflation outlook suggest policymakers at the South African Reserve Bank will likely lower borrowing costs by a another quarter-point to 7.75% at their final meeting of the year in November.The SARB started easing in September after holding the benchmark rate at 8.25% for more than a year. Analysts are divided on how long and deep the loosening cycle will be, with one expecting 150 basis points of adjustment and others two more quarter-point moves.Governor Lesetja Kganyago has remained resolute that future decisions will be data dependent. The central bank’s own forecasts show the policy rate declining to 7.17% by the end of next year and 7.09% in 2025 after adjustments to its consumer-price outlook. Inflation is now seen slowing to 4% in 2025, from a prior forecast of 4.4%.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The South African Reserve Bank’s easing cycle, which started on Sept. 19, will likely bring rates down to neutral by the second quarter of 2025. It will then put it on hold. Inflation has fallen below the mid-point of the SARB’s 3%-6% target, where policymakers would like it anchored. For the next several months, inflation should remain steady on lower oil prices, a firmer rand, and a better harvest. That should support two 25-basis-point cuts over the next six months.”—Yvonne MhangoMINT CENTRAL BANKSBanco de MexicoBanco de Mexico’s September cut opened the door to additional easing before the end of the year. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum takes power on October 1 and political noise led to volatility in the peso, as the country’s newly anointed congress passed legislation to overhaul the judicial system. But the five-member board’s decision to lower the rate a quarter-point suggested that would not be a deterrent.The Mexican economy is slowing and inflation is now closer to the bank’s target range, opening the door to talk of more cuts.The central bank predicts the economy will grow 1.5% this year, a downward revision of its prior forecast, as the US, Mexico’s No. 1 trade partner, shows signs of weakness. Banxico Governor Victoria Rodriguez has been a proponent of gradual changes to the reference rate.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Decelerating domestic demand and increasing economic slack signal inflation will continue slowing into next year. Policymakers have acknowledged inflation remains high and there are risks to its descent, but most agree monetary conditions are too tight and see room to cut rates. The Fed’s outsize cut and forward guidance in September provides additional flexibility. We expect reductions in November and December, for a total of 125 basis points this year, followed by 200 basis points of cuts in 2025.”—Felipe HernandezBank IndonesiaBank Indonesia is expected to ease monetary policy further in the fourth quarter, after it delivered a surprise rate cut in September. The rupiah is trading around the key psychological level of 15,000 against the dollar, and is expected to remain strong now that the Fed and other major central banks have pivoted.The easing should help boost the momentum of Southeast Asia’s largest economy, which is starting to get dragged down by weakening consumer sentiment, manufacturing activity and bank lending. It should also help incoming President Prabowo Subianto achieve his goal of powering growth to a world-beating pace of 8% when he starts his five-year term this month.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Bank Indonesia is likely to mirror the Fed’s rate cuts in the fourth quarter. This will maintain the rate differential – and sustain support for the rupiah, which it’s worked hard to prop up. Capital inflows will be vulnerable to market concerns that a US hard landing can’t be avoided as the US labor market cools further. Another potential strain for the currency is that fiscal policy won’t be as prudent under Prabowo, who takes the helm in October.”—Tamara HendersonCentral Bank of TurkeyEconomists and investors are debating the timing of Turkey’s first cut after the country’s aggressive tightening cycle lifted its rate to 50% from single digits in less than a year.The central bank has left benchmark borrowing cost at 50% for the last six meetings in order to cool 52% inflation to its target of around 38% at the end of this year. The economy is showing signs of slowing, and domestic demand, the main driver of hot prices, is normalizing, according to officials. Increasingly more investors are saying a rate cut could come in November, though some think it could be delayed to early next year. The course of policy will be data-driven, with the central bank focusing on inflation expectations of corporates and households, and monthly inflation.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The CBRT is continuing to tighten through its alternative tools even as it gets ready to kick off an easing cycle in 4Q. We see the policymakers’ criteria on inflation expectations and momentum pointing to November for that first step lower, taking the policy rate to 45% by year-end. Upside risks dominate the inflation outlook, which could delay some of those cuts we’ve pencilled in for this year into 2025.”—Selva Bahar BazikiCentral Bank of NigeriaNigeria’s policymakers surprised with a half-point hike on Sept. 24, despite annual inflation easing to a six-month low in August. Governor Olayemi Cardoso said the central bank remains concerned by elevated prices and the expected impact of a steep 45% increase in the cost of gasoline and floods that the United Nations estimates wiped out six-months’ worth of food for an estimated 8.5 million people. He also said the central bank wants a positive inflation-adjusted interest rate to attract investment into the economy, suggesting more rate hikes could be on the way unless there’s a drastic slowdown in inflation. The differential between inflation and the key rate is 490 basis points.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Nigeria’s surprise rate hike on Sept. 24 reveals the central bank remains worried about rising risk of inflation, not least from energy prices, and focused on restoring positive real rates. Policymakers increased rates by 50 basis points to 27.25%. And they’re not done. A couple of more quarters in this hiking cycle will help bring inflation (currently at 32.2%) below 30% in 1Q25 — also helped by a high base effect — and return real rates to positive territory.”—Yvonne MhangoOTHER G-20 CENTRAL BANKSBank of KoreaThe Bank of Korea is on track to a policy pivot in October if the property market in Seoul cools as it hopes by then. The board is worried a rate cut may throw fuel to a recovery in home prices and spur more mortgage loans that would aggravate the nation’s household debt, which stands at one of the highest levels in the world.An inflation slowdown, however, supports the case for a pivot, and a half-point cut by the Fed has eased currency concerns for South Korea.Lackluster consumption and lingering credit risks in the construction industry are other reasons the BOK may cut its rate on Oct. 11 after holding it at 3.5% since early 2023.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Bank of Korea is gearing up to kick off an easing cycle with inflation already at its 2% target and domestic demand sluggish. Concerns about rising property prices and household debt are the last hurdle. There are early signs that tighter regulation is beginning to rein in debt growth. We therefore see cuts starting in October, and the BOK will ease only gradually due to worries about financial stability risks. A second cut is likely to follow in 1Q25.”—Hyosung KwonReserve Bank of AustraliaWhile most of the developed world has begun easing, Australia isn’t ready to embark on that path yet. Governor Michele Bullock has said it’s premature to discuss rate cuts yet, warning there is still upside risk to inflation. The RBA increased rates by less than key developed-world counterparts during the 2022-23 tightening cycle and as a result is likely to have to keep them higher for longer to return inflation to target.Economists believe the next move will be down, though not until 2025. Before its next meeting in November, the RBA will have seen a key third-quarter inflation reading; an unexpected decline in prices could finally lead it to pivot away from its hawkish stance.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBA’s hawkish stance won’t last long. Cost-of-living subsidies have artificially pushed headline inflation back inside the 2%-3% target band, but underlying inflation looks to be undershooting the central bank’s August projections. The 3Q inflation reading will be a make-or-break catalyst for the November decision. We still see a path to easing beginning as early as 4Q, particularly if consumer spending and the labor market show signs of softening.”—James McIntyreCentral Bank of ArgentinaWhile Argentina’s central bank hasn’t laid out guidance for borrowing costs, President Javier Milei has said annual inflation will slow to 18.3% by December 2025, meaning rates will become positive in real terms.The monetary authority is keeping capital controls in place for now, and a concrete time-line for their removal remains elusive. Investors are paying close attention, given that any decision to roll back those restrictions would be a key step before the government returns to international debt markets.Argentina’s central bank shifted into the second phase of Milei’s economic plan in late June when it announced it would migrate its debt to the Treasury. Until that point, the institution had been cutting rates aggressively — to 40% from 133% in December — to reduce its liabilities.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Argentina kept its policy rate stable at 40% and held the monthly peso crawl at 2% for several months. That may change when President Milei eases or lifts currency controls. Doing so likely requires high, positive real rates and, with reserves low, a shift to a more flexible exchange-rate arrangement. Our base case is for this to happen between late 2024 and early 2025, in time for Argentina to tap markets and meet external bond payments due in January.”—Adriana DupitaG-10 CURRENCIES AND EAST EUROPE ECONOMIESSwiss National BankThe SNB started to cut rates already in March, before bigger peers switched to easing. It has now delivered three quarter-point reductions, and incoming president Martin Schlegel last week hinted that there could be more to come.With inflation at 1.1% and predicted to fall further, policymakers are fighting to contain the persistently strong franc, which suppresses price pressures by making imported goods cheaper. Some economists already warn consumer-price growth might go below the SNB’s 0-2% target range.If rates in the neighboring euro area drop more than expected before officials’ next scheduled meeting in December, that could further boost the Swiss currency’s strength and increase the likelihood of foreign-exchange interventions, a policy the SNB embraced before.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The SNB lowered rates for the third time by 25 basis points in September as it tried to strike a balance between staving off immediate upside pressures on the franc and preserving space for further cuts as easing cycles progress elsewhere. We expect another cut in December, to 0.75%. This would be somewhat below the SNB’s estimate of neutral and policymakers will proceed cautiously beyond that, but the central bank has clearly kept further easing on the table.”—Maeva CousinSveriges RiksbankSweden’s central bank took a decisive step toward more dovish policy last week, indicating that its next move could take the policy rate half a percentage point lower. That would mark a departure from the quarter-point cuts it has deployed three times already this year. Riksbank Governor Erik Thedeen and his deputies are set to announce their next decision on monetary policy on November 7, and by then they will have access to data on price increases in September, as well as an early indication of economic growth in the third quarter.While Thedeen was reluctant to indicate what may determine the size of the next cut, the bank can increase its focus on the health of the economy, as inflation expected to remain clearly below the 2% target through most of next year. Should the current lacklustre demand situation persist, or worsen, pressure will increase on the world’s oldest central bank to move faster toward a rate level that doesn’t hold back growth.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Riksbank will continue its cutting spree as inflation is safely under wraps under the 2% target through late 2025 alongside sluggish activity and a weak labor market where wage hike expectations remain modest. We expect the policymakers to trim the policy rate in the remaining two meetings to a year-end reading of 2.75%. Given the dovish shift in the global backdrop, risks are tilted towards a front-loaded single jumbo cut.”—Selva Bahar BazikiNorges BankNorway’s central bank is having a harder time taming inflation than most its developed-world peers, largely due to the weaker-than-projected krone feeding imported price growth and underpinning wage pressures. Norwegian officials are poised to keep borrowing costs at an almost 16-year high of 4.5% until the first quarter of 2025, according to their latest outlook.Even after inflation slowed more this year than the central bank forecast, policymakers still don’t see their 2%-target being achieved even by 2027. Uncertainty related to krone, the weakest performer so far this year among the Group of 10 major currencies, is a key factor behind the cautious stance of Governor Ida Wolden Bache and colleagues. While the energy-rich economy has barely grown in past months, and a lower oil price also supports earlier easing, Norges Bank is likely to remain among the last in the rich world to cut rates.Reserve Bank of New ZealandThe RBNZ reacted to stalling economic growth by starting to ease policy in August, and this will continue in the fourth quarter.The only uncertainty is the pace of declines, with most economists expecting quarter-point reductions at the two remaining meetings this year — in line with Governor Adrian Orr’s pledge to move at a measured pace.However, some observers argue the Official Cash Rate needs to get back to neutral more quickly than the RBNZ projects, and swaps pricing signals one half-point cut before year end.Key to the decisions will be data this month (Oct 16) which the RBNZ expects will show that inflation slowed to 2.3% — inside its 1-3% target for the first time in more than three years.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Reserve Bank of New Zealand needs to pick up the pace of its rate cuts. The economy has resumed contracting, the labor market is deteriorating faster than expected, and monthly price indicators suggest inflation could dramatically undershoot the central bank’s forecasts. We expect a 200-basis-point reduction in the Overnight Cash Rate by 3Q25, almost double the RBNZ’s projection of 115 basis points of cuts over the same period.”—James McIntyreNational Bank of PolandPoland’s central bank has kept rates unchanged for a year, as inflation has picked up in July after the government started to phase out crisis measures, including a cap on energy prices.With consumer prices expected to peak at the start of next year and later slow down, more and more policymakers have signalled that a monetary easing discussion will start early in 2025.Governor Adam Glapinski unexpectedly brought 2025 rate cuts back onto the agenda in September, saying that easing is possible around the middle of next year if inflation stays under control.Glapinski faces an unprecedented parliamentary probe, launched by the ruling coalition, which has accused the governor of irregularities over a bond-buying programme, among other things. While Glapinski denies any wrongdoing, first witnesses in the probe are expected to provide their testimonies this year.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Moderate inflation, a streak of downside surprises in activity and a decline in the ECB and Fed rates will convince the National Bank of Poland to start cutting the reference rate in 1Q25. For the rest of 2024 the rate is likely to remain at 5.75%.We believe money markets are right in estimating that policy makers will want to see inflation peak at around 6% year on year in December before delivering an initial 25-basis-point rate cut.”—Alexander IsakovCzech National BankThe Czech central bank left the door open for more rate cuts in the fourth quarter, after bringing the benchmark down by a cumulative 275 basis points in seven meetings. Market prices indicate investors betting on rates declining by another half of a percentage point through December, and dropping further to around 3% next year.Governor Ales Michl refrained from giving specific guidance on future rate path, but said policymakers will “carefully” consider their next steps as they weigh persistent price pressures in services against weak economic growth. “We are trying to prevent inflation in the Czech Republic from rising again,” Michl said after the latest quarter-point reduction on Sept. 25.–With assistance from Swati Pandey, Andrew Langley, Manuela Tobias, Aline Oyamada, Bastian Benrath-Wright, Matthew Boesler, Claire Jiao, Maya Averbuch, Amara Omeokwe, Erik Hertzberg, Beril Akman, Maria Eloisa Capurro, Matthew Malinowski, Monique Vanek, Nduka Orjinmo, Ntando Thukwana, Agnieszka Barteczko, Peter Laca, Niclas Rolander, Tracy Withers, Scott Johnson (Economist), Irina Anghel, Tony Halpin, Ott Ummelas, Anup Roy and Toru Fujioka.(Updates with euro-area inflation in ECB section, Japan PM in BOJ section)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","October 1, 2024 - 11:00"
54,Why Swiss trams have become sought-after vehicles in Ukraine,"The western city of Lviv may be far from the frontline in eastern Ukraine, but it hasn’t been left untouched by the Russian invasion. Among the most tangible transformations is its population growth: from a pre-war figure of 783,000 just two-and-a-half years ago, the city is now home to some 933,000 inhabitants – and counting.The new arrivals include businesses and people fleeing attacks in the east and south, the war wounded among them. These new residents are putting pressure on the city’s infrastructure, including its public transportation system.“More and more disabled people are arriving every day,” says Roman Mulyar, chief engineer at Lvivelectrotrans (LET), which operates Lviv’s trams and trolleybuses. “They have difficulty to enter the trams with their high floors.”To address this problem, Ukraine approached Switzerland, which finances sustainable urban-development projects in the country as part of its foreign aid programme. It’s one of just a handful of European states to subsidise, either in full or in part, the donation of used trams to other countries.For Lviv, Switzerland scooped up 11 decommissioned low-floor trams from Bern that are more accessible for people in wheelchairs or with disabilities.Although the Alpine country has donated hundreds of such vehicles to Eastern Europe in the last 20 years, the transfer to Lviv – plus that of several trams from Zurich to Vinnytsia in central Ukraine – marks the first time it’s doing so in the context of war. The risks and uncertainties posed by the conflict have forced Ukraine and Switzerland to rejig – but not give up – their plans.In Lviv, where civilian infrastructure has been the target of Russian drone and missile attacks, LET has dealt with multiple war-related challenges. In addition to a shortage of accessible trams, Mulyar cites a lack of spare parts that were mainly produced in eastern Ukraine, and the departure of dozens of staff for the front who, because of their specialised skills, are difficult to replace. The Bern trams will serve an urgent need in the city: they will run on a new extended line to a recently inaugurated national rehabilitation centre, called Unbroken, that aims to treat up to 10,000 civilians and soldiers per year. The arrival of the vehicles, dubbed “Vevey”

after their manufacturer, will boost LET’s fleet of low-floor trams from 19 to 29, says the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), which is coordinating the donation.“Mobility is a pivotal issue affecting the country since the Russian military aggression began – it’s essential for the economy, social inclusion and quality of life,” says Marc-Alexandre Graf, SECO programme manager. “The Bern trams are crucial for Lviv. They really need them.”Aside from improving accessibility, in both Vinnytsia and Lviv the donations will also help to modernise and decarbonise the cities’ public transportation systems. Although the Vevey trams are over 30 years old, they are less energy intensive than Lviv’s ageing Communist-era tram fleet and are expected to run for another ten to 12 years.As part of the donation, SECO finances four weeks of training for Ukrainian staff. It also covers the cost of spare parts, assistance in engineering adaptations – so the trams meet local certification requirements – and transportation of the trams to Ukraine.“As far as we know, Switzerland is the only country so far that has financed [such] broad projects for the transfer of used trams,” says Graf. SECO is covering the full cost of the Lviv donation to the tune of CHF1.8 million ($2 million).Generally, transfers are possible to destinations where similar tram infrastructure exists and the vehicles can be transported over a relatively short distance, Graf explains. In the last 20 years, Switzerland has sent trams to Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. Similarly, German and Austrian cities have donated to Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Ukraine alone has received trams from several German municipalities, as well as from Riga in Latvia and Prague in Czechia.The need for trams is so great in Lviv that Berlin recently announced it would donate 12 trams first used in the mid-1970s. Lviv also received
External link
a €17.4 million (CHF16.9 million) loan from the European Investment Bank to buy ten brand-new low-floor trams.The Berlin trams, however, are not low-floor vehicles. The same is true of used Zurich trams destined for Vinnytsia: 67 of them are being sent as part of a Swiss project that was launched before the war to help improve urban mobility.Like Lviv, Vinnytsia (population 417,000) has seen an influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Over 300 businesses alone have relocated to its relative safety, says SECO. It too has an ageing fleet of vehicles but plans to extend the rail network.Here too the Swiss trams will fill a demand for more accessible models. Several of the carriages will be used just for their spare parts: the Ukrainians will use the joints to attach new low-floor carriages they plan to build themselves onto the Zurich trams.But the Russian invasion has caused hiccups in the transfer.“It was on hold for several months because we weren’t sure we could transport the trams with a guarantee of safety for staff,” says Graf. Plans to send the trams by rail all the way to Vinnytsia also had to be adjusted as war raged, driving up costs. SECO has allocated CHF4.7 million for the donation.A first transfer finally went ahead in 2023. In all 35 trams arrived at the Ukrainian-Polish border by rail before being loaded onto long-bed trucks for the final leg of their two-week-long journey to Vinnytsia.Other travel plans, however, had to be cancelled, says Gwendoline Levasseur of the Zurich public transport provider, VBZ. Instead of the Swiss project teams visiting the destination cities to establish a link and train local personnel – just as they did when Zurich donated 86 trams to Vinnytsia in 2008-2012 – the Ukrainians came to Switzerland. The conflict situation made it too risky for the Swiss to travel to Ukraine.In Bern, Mulyar and three of his colleagues spent four weeks learning to drive, maintain and repair the Vevey trams.In Vinnytsia, most of the trams sent in 2008-2012 – which are now over 50 years old – “are in very good condition and remain in operation”, says Levasseur.Crucially, the trams have “contributed to a substantial improvement in the public transport system”, Graf says, pointing out that ridership grew by 26%. “The transfer of functional second-hand trams offers good value for money for the municipality, which has limited financial means.”Despite the support it has received, Lviv needs more trams still. The IDP population in Ukrainian cities is likely much higher than official figures suggest, says SECO, as many people staying with friends and family do not register with local authorities. Many of them are also expected to remain even after the war, so demand will continue to grow.Martin Häfliger, a technical consultant who’s helped to implement all of Switzerland’s tram donations, is on the case. At the time of writing, the expert planned to inspect used trams in a northern Swiss city to see if they’re compatible with Lviv’s rail infrastructure. If these don’t pan out, he knows of another municipality in Switzerland that will decommission trams in a couple of years’ time – a possible future donation, with any luck.Edited by Virginie Mangin","July 15, 2024 - 09:00"
55,‘We need to put civilians at the centre of peacebuilding’,"“Peace cannot be taken for granted”, says Renée Larivière, Senior Director of Programme Management at Interpeace, an NGO which focusses on fostering peace. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), there are around 120 armed conflicts around the world today, compared to 20 just 30 years ago. This escalation in violence raises critical questions about the feasibility of achieving and maintaining peace in such a tense geopolitical landscape.
 
The 22nd edition of the Geneva Peace Talks
External link
, which begins on September 19, will explore the future of peacebuilding amidst these growing challenges. Interpeace, based in Geneva, works around the globe to embed peace in societies broken by war. Larivière talks to SWI about what a peacebuilder does and what role they play at a time when the number of wars has never been greater.
 
SWI swissinfo.ch: Interpeace’s mission is to promote peace and prevent violence in conflict-prone areas. What is peacebuilding and how does it work exactly?
 
Renée Larivière: Interpeace was founded 30 years ago by the United Nations, at a time when the nature of conflicts worldwide was shifting. In the 1990s, there were fewer wars between states but more conflicts arising from civil wars. High-level mediation was no longer enough to build peace. The UN and the international community had to find new ways to support peace processes by putting civilians at the centre of the process. This transition led to the creation of Interpeace to accompany civil societies impacted by conflict. We foster dialogue with the very people whose lives have been affected.Peacebuilding is not only about creating the right conditions in society so that mediation can take place but also rebuilding trust after sometimes decades-long conflicts and finding ways to live together again. This shift does not happen overnight. The signing of a peace agreement is just the beginning of this very long process.SWI: Do you have a specific example you can share?R.L.: Building peace is an ongoing process and a long-term commitment. For instance, we continue to work in Rwanda, thirty years after the genocide. Over the years, our approach has evolved. We’ve established platforms for dialogue where people can talk about their differences and find ways to coexist. We also focus on issues of youth empowerment, peace education, reconciliation and trauma healing.For the 20th commemoration of the genocide, we conducted a survey to understand how much society had healed. The results revealed that trauma levels remained high even after two decades. Despite significant efforts in reconciliation and transitional justice, much of the trauma had been passed down to the younger generations who had not directly experienced the genocide. That insight helped us to refine our approach and we continue to work on trauma healing to this day.
 
SWI: Interpeace has been operating for 30 years in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America. What shifts in conflicts have you noticed in the last three decades?
 
R.L.: We’ve reached the highest number of violent conflicts since the Second World War
External link
. Global military spending is at its highest for the ninth consecutive year, reaching up to $2,443 billion.
External link
In contrast, spending for peace totals only $49.6 billion, representing less than 0.6% of global defense expenditures.
External linkThe nature of warfare has also evolved significantly. Today, wars are both civil and interstate. Conflicts are not only increasing in number, but with the use of AI and misinformation, they are also ever more complex.. This creates an environment where responses are oftentimes more reactive rather than prevention-oriented.
 
SWI: In this context, with escalating wars and rising violence towards aid workers, is there still room for peace? 
 
R.L.: Peace should never be taken for granted, even in countries that have been untouched by war. As we’ve seen in recent years, even in Europe, peace is a fragile dynamic that can rapidly change. In some cases, like in Syria in 2011, the violence is so extreme that it becomes difficult to work. When civilians are receiving bombs on a daily basis, the time is not right to enter a dialogue process.

Yet hope remains. It’s important to adapt our peacebuilding tools by including the local population, such as women and children. Women are always on the frontline when a crisis hits in their community. We tend to forget that they have a unique ability to transform conflict into cooperation and hatred into understanding. And that’s because women often act behind the scenes and can hence occupy a very critical role in helping establish trust in a time of conflict. The same goes for young people, particularly in Africa where over 60% of the population is under 25. If you ignore that part of the population, and they feel sidelined, that poses serious risk of unrest.
 
SWI: You started your career in Peru, Pakistan and Indonesia, working on conflicts related to natural resources. How is peacebuilding related to environmental issues?
 
R.L.: At the beginning of my career, I mostly focused on conflicts related to the extractive industry, which were then considered quite separate from traditional peacebuilding. Today these fields are increasingly intertwined. We are seeing a significant shift, with more conflicts arising from the scarcity of natural resources rather than just their management. For instance, arid farmlands are increasingly leading to displacements which, in turn, cause conflicts. In today’s context, we cannot separate peacebuilding from environmental issues. Climate change is the greatest challenge we are facing, with widespread destabilising effects that have not been anticipated. The electrification of our societies, for instance, is driving a race for critical minerals, which is reviving conflicts related to the extractive industry.SWI: This year’s Geneva Peace Talks are focused on ‘the future of peace’. What are the challenges ahead for peacebuilding?
 
R.L.: Peace talks gather the testimonies of extraordinary people, who act for the better good in the face of ongoing conflict. These are the stories of the unseen and unsung heroes that act in the shadows. It’s important that we keep that hope and fire burning even in the face of adversity. Peace is possible.
 
The main challenge ahead is that mindsets are returning towards a more military response to conflicts, rather than considering the social and cultural dimensions. By focusing on looking inwards and protecting their own borders, states risk losing sight of the fact that we are all connected.Edited by Virginie Mangin","September 18, 2024 - 20:15"
56,‘City dwellers don’t see the efforts agriculture is making in terms of environmentalism’,"Acts of vandalism, insults and even death threats marred the campaign leading up to the vote on the anti-pesticide initiatives in 2021. Hofmann, a writer and winegrower from canton Vaud, had a tough time. This unease gave rise to his book Faire Paysan (Being a farmer), which seeks to promote dialogue between town and country.The biodiversity initiative, which aims to oblige public authorities to devote more space and resources to nature, has once again angered some farmers, who fear it will severely restrict food production. For their part, the majority of built-up areas are in favour, as shown by the first gfs.bern poll published in mid-August. However, the campaign for the vote has got off to a peaceful start. Hofmann believes that relations between rural and urban areas are now calmer than they were three years ago, even if divisions persist. SWI swissinfo.ch: Your own career has taken you across the divide between town and country. You are the son and grandson of a farmer, but you lived in the city for 15 years before moving back to the countryside near Morges in canton Vaud. How did you experience these changes?Blaise Hofmann: I’ll always have a rural sensibility. You don’t lose that when you’ve grown up on a farm. I still have cousins who are farmers. I farm a hectare of vines. I used to be a sheep farmer. I’ve written a lot about rural life. So the link with the farming world is there, but I know I’m not part of it anymore, because I’ve lived in the city, I’ve studied at university and I’m doing another job. Today, I’m a writer-winemaker. So I’m halfway between the city and the farming world. I’ve realised that my unease is actually an asset. My position allows me to act as a bridge between the two worlds. SWI: In your book Faire paysan you refer to the gap between town and country as the ‘new Röstigraben’, Switzerland’s linguistic divide. When did the countryside and the city start to understand each other less in Switzerland? B.H.: I’d say 1996 was a pivotal year. The mad cow crisis was raging and causing a crisis of confidence among consumers, who were worried about the transmission of this bovine disease to humans. That same year, a large farmers’ demonstration was also suppressed by the police in Bern. Above all, however, the Swiss people voted in favour of a new agricultural policy, which enshrined the system of direct payments [contributions paid to farmers in return for services provided in the general interest]. Farmers are no longer just the ones who feed the population, but also the ones who maintain the landscape. This has brought about a radical change in the way farming is perceived. SWI: What are the reasons for this?B.H.: On the one hand, people who are not in the farming profession feel that they are the ones who are financing agriculture with their taxes. On the other, farmers feel they are losing some of their legitimacy and dignity. In their minds, they got into this profession to feed people, not to be landscape gardeners. This creates tensions between farmers and others.SWI: What do you think divides these two worlds?B.H.: Only 2% of the population now works in agriculture. So we’ve lost the direct link. We live close to farmers, but we don’t necessarily know what they do. You don’t necessarily have a farmer friend who can explain it to you. As a result, city dwellers don’t understand what farmers do, and vice versa. You can even see this distance in language. For example, a farmer will talk about “terroir” and a city dweller about “circuit court” (short cycle), a term that annoys farmers. We’re talking about the same thing, but we don’t have the same codes. SWI: But don’t you have the impression that this divide is less marked in Switzerland than in other countries, such as the United States or France?B.H.: Since writing the book in 2021, I’ve realised that these two worlds are still very much linked in Switzerland compared with other countries. Here, the towns are so small that everyone has some kind of link with the countryside: childhood memories, holidays, an acquaintance or a family member who farms the land.There has also been an evolution since the pandemic. People have tried to grow things in their own gardens and have discovered direct sales. With the outbreak of war in Ukraine, there have also been more questions about food sovereignty. There are now also young farmers who approach their profession in a different way, who are better at communicating and who have acquired a greater awareness of biodiversity.SWI: You have met many farmers who are making efforts to modernise their farms and make them more sustainable. Does this get enough attention in the city?B.H.: It’s true that city dwellers don’t see the efforts agriculture is making in terms of ecology. An ecological shift began 30 years ago. Admittedly, the change is too slow, but many steps in the direction of greater sustainability have been taken. More and more plant protection products are banned, or are used more sparingly. There is already land devoted exclusively to biodiversity. Many farmers cultivate some of their plots organically, without actually holding the label. Hedgerows are being replanted, and agroforestry is being developed, combining trees and crops to better protect the soil. However, these initiatives in favour of the environment need to be explained to people who are not in the business. Farmers could do more to communicate and popularise, and city dwellers should be more curious, not just go to the countryside to play sport and relax.SWI: Do the farmers who stick to their guns and who don’t want to change still have a future?B.H.: This type of farming is already disappearing. There is resistance, but it’s mainly among the older farmers. As in every profession, there are people who innovate, who like to take risks, and others who fear change. We mustn’t forget that the weight of tradition is particularly strong in working the land, because it’s linked to respect for elders. If we change our practices, we sometimes feel that we are disrespecting them. Edited by Samuel Jaberg. Translated from French by DeepL/ts","August 21, 2024 - 09:00"
57,Swiss to vote on raising retirement age to 66: a visionary idea or an unwelcome plan?,"Just over a year after agreeing to raise the retirement age for women from 64 to 65, the Swiss will go to the polls on March 3 to decide whether to push it back to 66 for all.If the proposal is accepted, Switzerland will be following the trend seen in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), where the average retirement age is set gradually to increase to 65.7 for women and 66.1 for men by 2060, according to the body’s Pensions at a Glance
External link
report.The retirement age for women in Switzerland went up on January 1, 2024, as part of a progressive, four-stage increase to 65. This is the result of a reform of the old-age and survivors’ insurance scheme (known as the AHV/AVS), the first pillar of the Swiss pension system, which was approved by the electorate in a federal referendum in September 2022.Two months after this first change came into force, the issue will be back on the table. In March, voters will cast their ballots on a federal popular initiative, submitted by the centre-right Young Radical-Liberals in July 2021 with 145,000 signatures.The initiative “for a secure and sustainable old-age pension scheme” proposes gradually increasing the statutory retirement age for women and men to 66 by 2033. After that, it would be pegged to life expectancy. In other words, it would be raised automatically if life expectancy increased, and vice versa.Specifically, the text proposes raising the retirement age by 80% of any increase in life expectancy. Thus, if life expectancy goes up by one month, the retirement age will rise by 0.8 months. The goal of the initiative’s promoters is to enable people to spend around 20% of their lives in retirement. Following this formula, retirement at 67 would come about by 2043 and retirement at 69 in 2070.Although it has been taken up by the Young Radical-Liberals, this solution for closing the public pension funding gap is not new. The Conservative Democratic Party proposed it in 2012 in a motion that was rejected by the senators.In 2022, the old-age insurance scheme closed its books with a profit of CHF1.6 billion ($1.8 billion) and assets of CHF47 billion. Its finances have thus stabilised for the moment. This is partly thanks to the reform measures, known as AHV/AVS21, adopted in 2022 and the federal act on tax reform and pension funding passed in 2019, which led to a drop in expenditure and increase in revenue.In the medium term, however, state pension funding is not guaranteed, as the scheme is facing a structural problem. The number of people receiving a pension is increasing faster than those in gainful employment, and as life expectancy increases pensions need to be paid for longer. According to projections
External link
by the Federal Social Insurance Office, the AHV/AVS will be in deficit from 2031.Raising the retirement age to 66, as called for by the initiative, would enable a saving of around CHF2 billion by 2030, again according to the Federal Social Insurance Office
External link
. Pension funding would thus be guaranteed at least until 2033.The state pension scheme urgently needs to be put on a sustainable footing, the Young Radical-Liberals argue, to prevent it from collapse. The party presents its text as the solution to guarantee long-term financing, without cutting pensions or adding taxes.The initiative’s promoters also believe that linking the retirement age to life expectancy would help depoliticise the issue, by creating an automatic mechanism for adjusting the benchmark age.As we live longer, we also have to work longer to pay for our pensions, the Young Radical-Liberals say. Other Western countries have already taken this step, they argue.According to the federal government, pension funding is currently guaranteed for the next ten years or so. Measures will certainly need to be taken to ensure long-term financing. However, the Federal Council – the executive body – is already drawing up a plan to stabilise the AHV/AVS for the 2030 to 2040 period, which it will submit to the parliament in 2026.The government also argues that the demographic problem facing the old-age provision system cannot be resolved solely by raising the retirement age. Other measures are needed, including additional funding.The idea of pegging retirement age to life expectancy has not won over the authorities either. In their view, an automatic mechanism of this kind would not take sufficient account of the actual situation on the labour market – particularly that of older people – or the social situation.It would moreover not be compatible with the Swiss political system. By enshrining the retirement age in the constitution, the government, the parliament and the people would lose the necessary flexibility to take other criteria into consideration.The Radical-Liberal Party supports the initiative of its youth section, but it stands alone in this. The other government parties oppose it. The government and a large majority in the parliament are also recommending voters to reject it. Unsurprisingly, the business community is in favour of the initiative, while the trade unions are against it.A number of European countries have already opted for more or less automatic mechanisms to link the retirement age to changes in life expectancy, as laid out in a report
External link
by the interior ministry. These include Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, Bulgaria and Estonia.The systems put in place in the different countries have different features, however, and the experience gained so far is limited, meaning it is early days to draw conclusions. Portugal and Italy are the only countries whose retirement age has actually been raised by an automatic mechanism. In Portugal, it has increased by just a few months and currently stands at 66 years and four months. In Italy, meanwhile, the introduction of this mechanism led to a steep hike in the retirement age: from 60 in 2012 to 67 today.","January 4, 2024 - 09:00"
58,Putting the fight against HIV back on the UN agenda,"Gniwali Ndangou lives in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic. She is an orphan and was the only one of her siblings to have to take pills daily throughout her childhood. Her guardian told her that the medication was for malaria and headaches. It wasn’t until the age of 17 when Gniwali threatened to stop taking her medication, that her sister finally told her the truth: she was born with HIV.Today, she works as a peer educator and community health worker at a centre for sexual education for young people, the Centre d’information et d’éducation sexuelle des jeunes CISJEU (Center for Youth Sexual Education and Information).It offers services run by the local population, such as HIV tests and information on HIV prevention. Teenagers and young adults living with the virus are also supported by their peers to take medication and maintain treatment so that they don’t transmit the virus.  The centre saved her life and is a beacon of hope for many young people like Gniwali who are forced to live with HIV. UNAIDS says that in sub-Saharan Africa, 3,100 teenage girls and young women are still infected with the virus every week. They are three times more likely to be infected with HIV than their male peers. UNAIDS is a joint program of eleven UN organisations, including WHO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UN Women and the World Bank.The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to eliminate AIDS as a threat to public health by 2030. Given the rate of infection in parts of the world, UNAIDS is raising alarm bells and calling for more medical and financial support.In eastern and southern Africa, HIV infection rates among 15 to 19-year-old girls are almost six times higher than among boys of the same age. Women aged 20 to 24 are more than twice as likely to be infected as men of the same age. And 86% of children born with the virus live in Africa.“These sobering figures tell us that we absolutely need to prioritise girls and young women, especially in sub-Saharan Africa,” says Suki Beavers, Director of Equality and Rights for all at UNAIDS, in an interview with SWI swissinfo.ch in Geneva. She cites discrimination, lack of gender equality, violence and poverty as reasons why girls and young women are susceptible to HIV infection. To prevent infection by the virus, it is also important that those affected are not stigmatised, discriminated against or criminalised, says Beavers.“If people have to fear being arrested when they go to get medication, they are far less likely to seek treatment and stick with it,” she says. Uganda, for example, has recently tightened laws against homosexuals.Individual measures are not enough for a sustainable HIV response, say UN organisations. They are therefore focusing on cross-sectoral approaches. “The fight against disease is as much a fight for justice and equality as it is a medical fight,” Peter Sands, Director of the Global Fund to Fight HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told reporters in Geneva in September.Beavers stresses that communities living with HIV have to be at the centre of a sustainable HIV response. In addition to women and girls, these include key populations such as drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men. This means that communities should for example be responsible for implementing targets. These include that 30% tests and treatment and 80% of prevention measures should be led by communities themselves.Above all, however, UN organisations are focusing on education. “It is well documented that girls are less at risk of contracting HIV if they can complete secondary school,” says Beavers. Every year that girls stay in school longer also means that they have a higher income later on. “That’s one of the points we should focus on.” According to Beavers, changes in behavioral norms are also needed, such as raising awareness on domestic violence by men.As part of its “Education Plus” initiative targeting girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa, UNAIDS is working with governments and civil society to ensure that young people can attend and complete secondary school free of charge, especially pregnant students. Education and sport are used to promote equality between girls and boys as well as a violence-free environment. Care is taken to ensure that girls are not stigmatised due to HIV, pregnancy or because they have been raped. Furthermore, laws that require parental consent are to be repealed so that young people have access to HIV prevention and treatment.UNAIDS could not confirm the total cost of the initiative.The African Union, a group of 55 African countries, is supporting this initiative and a group of 15 African countries is participating. These include Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Other countries are also interested. However, structural debt and the cost of interest makes it difficult for many African countries to finance such programmes. According to UNAIDS, Angola, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia currently have to spend more than 50% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on servicing their debt.This has a direct impact on how much money countries have for gender equality and human rights initiatives and education, and therefore on the rights of women and girls in everyday life, explains Beavers.Of the 40 million people living with HIV worldwide today, the majority, around 26 million, live in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the region has reduced new HIV infections by 56% since 2010, this success cannot be maintained if the financial scope is limited, UNAIDS warned in a report published in September. “HIV is no longer on the agenda,” regrets Beavers. Climate change and wars have pushed the issue aside, she says.At the recent UN Summit of the Future in New York and UN General Assembly gathering, both in September, UNAIDS reminded the attendees that HIV and AIDS are not over yet. By 2025, $29.3 billion will be needed worldwide to combat the transmission of the virus. UNAIDS called on the international community to work towards affordable drug prices. Current medication must be taken daily to protect against infections caused by HIV.A new drug called Lenacapavir can be only administered as an injection every six months. This has the advantage that girls and women no longer have to regularly collect their medication from a clinic and therefore run less risk of being seen and stigmatised by relatives or acquaintances. However, this medication is too expensive for girls and young women, says Beavers. And the patents held by the big pharmaceutical companies prevent generics from being produced.According to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), AIDS should be eliminated as a threat to public health by 2030. The aim is no more new HIV infections and no more AIDS cases by 2030. To achieve this, UNAIDS has defined several approaches, including the 95-95-95 strategy, which focuses on HIV testing and treatment of those affected.Under this strategy, 95% of all people living with HIV should know that they are infected with HIV by 2025. Also, 95% of all people diagnosed with HIV should receive lifesaving antiretroviral treatment and 95% of all people receiving such treatment should no longer be infectious by 2025. In order to ensure this, another strategy is to reduce social and legal barriers to the use of HIV services. This should also help to ensure that at least 90% of women and girls have equal rights and are not exposed to violence.“The commitment in the SDGs to end AIDS as a threat to public health by 2030 can be achieved,” says Beavers. But only if the political will and the necessary funding exist and the necessary policy and programmatic changes actually take place.Edited by Virginie Mangin/sb","October 15, 2024 - 09:00"
59,"At Tahiti’s Olympic surfing venue, Polynesians fight for a reef and a way of life","By Lincoln FeastTEAHUPO’O, Tahiti (Reuters) – On the remote south coast of Tahiti, its Jurassic peaks and azure lagoon accessible only by boat, Patrick Rochette is explaining how centuries-old Polynesian conservation traditions are being revived to protect this unique environment.Mingled with gruesome tales of the island’s history of tribal wars and the roots of wave-riding, it’s a compelling account that resonates with the school children that the Tahitian elder has brought to this idyllic spot close to the Olympic surfing venue of Teahupo’o.Among the interconnected Polynesian concepts lost or repressed during Tahiti’s French colonisation that Rochette describes: respect for tupuna, the ancestors; mana, the spiritual power of people and places; tapu, that which is sacred; rahui, a restriction or prohibition; and the guardians – the whales, sharks, turtles.“It’s up to the children to go home with this information and explain it to their parents,” says Rochette, a burly 63-year-old.For Rochette and others, countering the pressures of over-exploitation and climate change go hand-in-hand with a cultural renaissance in the Pacific island group, a distinct Polynesian identity that spans the world’s largest ocean.“We Polynesians, in 15 or 20 years, if we don’t do anything, there’ll be nothing left,” Rochette said in a boat, speeding down the jungle-clad coast. “We have to do it together, not just here, but the Pacific community has to do all of this together.”The Polynesian Triangle encompasses some 10 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean with Hawaii, New Zealand (Aotearoa) and Easter Island (Rapa Nui) at its corners. Its people, who trace their lineage back to a spiritual homeland, are closely connected by language, culture and their seafaring history.As ideas of sustainability and conservation build momentum around the world, the adoption of traditional and culturally relevant approaches is becoming more popular among Indigenous communities.In Polynesia, an intimate knowledge of the moana, the ocean, and the concept of guardianship is resonating as pressures on reefs and lagoons from both development and climate change grow.WAVE OF MANATereva David is also working with the local Teahupo’o community to embrace the Polynesian way of living in harmony with the environment.One of the best to ride the Paris Olympic’s ferocious wave in front of his village, David has run camps for promising young French Polynesian surfers for the past decade.David, 35, teaches them respect – not just for the wave, but for themselves, for each other and for their culture and environment.“My mom, when she was a little girl, she was forbidden to speak Tahitian,” he said. “For a while there, it wasn’t looking good when you speak Tahitian – ‘Oh, you’re too rude, or you’re from the street, or from Teahupo’o, in the bush.'”Now, Tahitian language and culture is a source of pride in Teahupo’o, where clear rivers run through the village to the black sand beach and the lagoon.Olympic gold for 22-year-old local surfer Kauli Vaast also generated great mana, spiritual power or cultural pride.“Only kings were able to surf here before,” David said. “For us, surfing is sacred, it’s the culture – like dancing, like canoe paddling, like singing, like making food for everybody.”David said the community had worked to ensure having one of the world’s most powerful and alluring waves on their doorsteps fully benefited the village. Locals now provide surf camps, camera operators, taxi boats, and water safety patrols when top surfers come for big swells.“It took us a long time but we finally did it. Now, nobody comes in and does it like the circus – we regulate,” says David.“For us, it was the thing to do, to represent our mana, to represent our tupuna, our ancestors.”The Olympics brought fresh challenges, with locals fighting to reduce the impact of new Games infrastructure, including insisting that a new tower on the reef to judge the surf contest be scaled back to reduce its environmental impact.RESTORE THE RAHUIThe reef – “the oxygen we breath,” says David – is at the heart of the surf and the village, a unique, living structure that not only creates the perfect waves, but is a larder, a playground and a workplace for almost everyone who lives there.Ten years ago, however, the reef was struggling.Plagued by over-fishing and hit more frequently by damaging storms, a decision was made by the community to re-introduce a rahui over a 768-hectare area south of the village, banning fishing and other activities.“In the older culture, it was the king who decided these things and you couldn’t go against it, you would be killed,” and many people were afraid of the concept, said Rochette, who manages the Teahupo’o rahui.The approach has been modernised and democratised, with the communities across French Polynesia now instigating rahui and deciding how to operate them to sustain their environment and resources.South of Teahupo’o, buoys are set out to mark the rahui limits, and locals monitor the zone to ensure compliance. They say the impact has been mostly positive, with the reef thriving and fish stocks improving.Scrambling over streams and paths of broken coral, Rochette tells the story of a sacred rock and its role in ancestral fishing rituals, recounts battles that turned the lagoon red with blood and details how surfing was introduced here by twin brothers.While the cultural aspects have been significant, ascribing an economic value to the environment has also been important.Cliff Kapono, a Hawaiian coral scientist, surfer and Polynesian activist, worked with locals to map and value the economic impact that works around the Olympics could have on the reef and lagoon using an established formula.Kapono’s MEGA Lab estimated a direct economic impact of $170,000 for disturbing and destroying corals at the judging tower site and $1.3 million in total for the wider reef disruption around Teahupo’o from dredging and other works.Beyond the economics, the idea of being guardians of the ocean was intrinsic to the Polynesian philosophy, Kapono said.“There are people and communities across Polynesia that are defending their reefs. Whether they get hit by the Olympic people, or over-fishing, or nuclear testing, there are people that are going to stand up in these communities.“For us in Polynesia, that’s who we are, that’s our roots,” says Kapono. “This is now the war we fight. We fight for our environment.”","August 18, 2024 - 11:06"
60,Secretive Hamas military chief masterminded Oct 7 strike on Israel,"By Samia Nakhoul and Laila BassamDUBAI(Reuters) – Hamas’ elusive military leader Mohammed Deif, one of the masterminds behind what Israel called its 9/11 moment, rarely speaks and never appears in public, a secretive existence that helped him survive seven assassination attempts.Now he is being sought outside of Gaza, from where he directed the Oct. 7 attack which took Israel by surprise, killing 1,200 people and creating a crisis for the far-right government by taking more than 250 people hostage.The International Criminal Court prosecutor’s office said on Monday it had requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence chief and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes, including Deif.Israel has denied committing war crimes in the Gaza war.The ICC’s decision “equates the victim with the executioner”, a senior Hamas official told Reuters.It will be up to the court’s pre-trial judges to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to issue warrants.Deif survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021, in a long and secretive career in the militant group, leaving him disfigured and using a wheelchair.In the months since Oct. 7, Deif is believed to have been directing Hamas military operations from the tunnels and backstreets of Gaza, alongside senior colleagues.Rising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group’s network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He has topped Israel’s most wanted list for decades, and is held responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.He and two other Hamas leaders in Gaza formed a three-man military council that planned the Oct. 7 raid, the bloodiest attack in Israel’s 75-year history.In its wake, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government vowed to eliminate the three: Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Deif, head of the military wing, and Marwan Issa his deputy, who was reported killed by Israel in March.In an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on Oct. 7, Deif named the raid “Al Aqsa Flood”, signalling the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa mosque.It was in May 2021, after a raid on Islam’s third-holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world, that Deif began planning the operation, a source close to Hamas said.“It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al Aqsa mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,” the source said.That storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting between Israel and Hamas.There are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast.Deif rarely speaks and never appears in public. So when Hamas’s TV channel announced he was about to speak on Oct. 7, Palestinians knew something significant was afoot.“Today the rage of Al Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,” Deif said in the recording.TWO BRAINS, ONE MASTERMINDThe source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the attack was taken jointly by Deif, who leads Hamas’s armed wing, known as Al Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, but it was clear who was the architect.“There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,” the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.An Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.The plan, as conceived by Deif, involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas, an ally of Israel’s sworn foe Iran, was not interested in launching a conflict and was focusing instead on economic development in Gaza, where the movement is the governing power.But while Israel began providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group’s fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight of the Israeli military, the source close to Hamas said.Speaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land.“In light of the orgy of occupation and its denial of international laws and resolutions, and in light of American and western support and international silence, we’ve decided to put an end to all this,” he said.Born as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the militant leader became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.He was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.Deif earned a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He displayed an affinity for the arts, heading the university’s entertainment committee and performing on stage in comedies.Hamas sources said he lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel’s assassination attempts.His wife, seven-month-old son, and three-year-old daughter were killed by an Israeli airstrike in 2014.His survival while running Hamas’s armed wing earned him the status of a Palestinian folk hero. He did not use modern digital technology such as smart phones, the source close to Hamas said.“He is elusive. He is the man in the shadows.”","May 20, 2024 - 21:29"

62,Gloomy youth pull US and western Europe down global happiness ranking,"By David MillikenLONDON (Reuters) – Rising unhappiness among younger people has caused the United States and some large western European countries to fall down a global wellbeing index, while Nordic nations retain their grip on the top spots.The annual World Happiness Report, launched in 2012 to support the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, is based on data from U.S. market research company Gallup, analysed by a global team now led by the University of Oxford.People in 143 countries and territories are asked to evaluate their life on a scale from zero to 10, with 10 representing their best possible life. Results from the past three years are averaged to create a ranking.Finland remained in the top spot – with an average score of 7.7 – followed closely by Denmark, Iceland and Sweden, while Afghanistan and Lebanon held the bottom two spots, with scores of 1.7 and 2.7 respectively.In broad terms, the rankings are loosely correlated with countries’ prosperity, but other factors such as life expectancy, social bonds, personal freedom and corruption appear to influence individuals’ assessments too.The United States dropped out of the top 20 for the first time, falling to 23rd place from 15th last year, due to a big drop in the sense of wellbeing of Americans aged under 30, the report shows.While a global ranking of the happiness of those aged 60 and over would place the United States 10th, under 30s’ life evaluations alone put the United States in 62nd place.The findings are at odds with much previous research into wellbeing, which found happiness highest in childhood and early teens, before falling to its lowest in middle age, then rising around retirement.“Youth, especially in North America, are experiencing a mid-life crisis today,” said Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, a University of Oxford economics professor and one of the report’s editors.Millenials and younger age groups in North America were significantly more likely than older age groups to report loneliness.But De Neve said a range of factors was likely to be lowering young peoples’ happiness, including increased polarisation over social issues, negative aspects of social media, and economic inequality that made it harder for young people to afford their own homes than in the past.While the phenomenon is starkest in the United States, the age gap in wellbeing is also wide in Canada and Japan, and to a decreasing extent in France, Germany and Britain, which all lost ground in this year’s rankings.By contrast, many of the countries with the biggest improvements in wellbeing are former communist countries in central and eastern Europe.There, unlike in richer countries, young people report significantly better quality of life than older people, often on a par or better than in western Europe.“Slovenia, Czechia and Lithuania are moving into the top 20 and that’s wholly driven by their youth,” De Neve said.","March 21, 2024 - 09:02"
63,"Architect Pierre de Meuron: ‘Switzerland isn’t ugly, but there’s room for improvement’","“No, Switzerland is not ugly,” de Meuron said, addressing the so-called “hideous” Switzerland portrayed by Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) in an article this summer. Born in Basel, de Meuron co-founded the world-renowned architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron with his childhood friend Jacques Herzog and together they’ve tackled iconic projects like the Tate Modern in London, Beijing’s national stadium, and Basel’s Roche towers, including Switzerland’s tallest skyscraper (205m).Their first major project in French-speaking Switzerland, the Lombard Odier headquarters in canton Geneva, is scheduled for inauguration in 2025. Described by the firm as “avant-garde,” “elegant,” and “sustainable,” this building showcases Herzog & de Meuron’s signature emphasis on quality. However, de Meuron believes that other projects across Switzerland often lack this level of care.Switzerland isn’t “ugly,” de Meuron said, but there are “many” architectural mistakes, especially in cities and suburbs. “Sometimes, too much emphasis is placed on profitability,” he noted, often at the expense of “architectural quality.” Yet he believes that quality architecture does not necessarily have to be more expensive. “It’s about doing the best we can with the means we have,” he explained.Commenting on urban sprawl, which is a growing concern in Swiss urban development, de Meuron cautioned: “We must be careful it doesn’t go any further.” Uncontrolled expansion, he warns, could lead to irreversible impacts on Swiss landscapes.Despite his age, de Meuron isn’t ready to leave his passion for beauty behind. He said he’ll keep working “as long as I enjoy it”. Any decisions about retirement will be made alongside his partner Jacques Herzog, as well as his wife and family, he added.Adapted from French by DeepL/amva/sb","October 28, 2024 - 11:00"
64,US launches Red Sea force as ships reroute to avoid attacks,"By Phil Stewart and John DavisonMANAMA/DUBAI (Reuters) – The United States on Tuesday launched a multinational operation to safeguard commerce in the Red Sea as attacks by Iran-backed Yemeni militants forced major shipping companies to reroute, stoking fears of sustained disruptions to global trade.The Houthi militant group, which controls vast amounts of territory in Yemen after years of war, has since last month fired drones and missiles at international vessels sailing through the Red Sea – attacks it says respond to Israel’s devastating assault on the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.This week, the attacks began to take a toll on global trade, disrupting a key trade route that links Europe and North America with Asia via the Suez Canal.Oil major BP paused all Red Sea transits, and a slew of top shipping firms including Maersk started diverting shipments normally made through Suez around the Cape of Good Hope on Africa’s southern tip. The new route around Africa adds days to journey times and raises costs. The list of companies avoiding the Red Sea continued to grow on Tuesday.The crisis, which has grown out of the war between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, is the latest in the Middle East to pit the United States and its allies against Iran and its regional Arab proxy militias.Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, drawing a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed more than 19,000 Palestinians in Gaza.Iranian proxies including the Houthis and Lebanese Hezbollah have fired rockets at Israel since the conflict began. The Houthis, meanwhile, have stepped up their Red Sea attacks, threatening to target all ships heading to Israel and warning shipping companies against dealing with Israeli ports.U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who is on a trip to Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy’s headquarters in the Middle East, said Britain, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain were among nations involved in the Red Sea security operation.The group, widely dubbed in media reports a “task force,” will conduct joint patrols in the southern Red Sea and the adjacent Gulf of Aden.“This is an international challenge that demands collective action,” Austin said in a statement, announcing the initiative as “Operation Prosperity Guardian.” He called on other countries to contribute as he condemned “reckless Houthi actions”.But it was unclear how many other countries are willing to do what mostly U.S. warships have done in recent days – shoot down Houthi missiles and drones, and rush to the aid of commercial ships under attack.A European diplomat whose country will take part in the task force said the idea of the operation was for participating nations’ ships to shoot down missiles and drones and accompany vessels through the Red Sea.The Houthis, in a statement late on Tuesday, said they were only targeting Israeli ships or ships heading into Israeli ports and posed no threat to any country, but accused the new U.S.-led task force of being “part of the aggression against Gaza and the Palestinian people.”Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a senior Houthi official, told Iranian TV on Tuesday that any country acting against Houthi forces would see its ships targeted in the Red Sea.A U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity played down the idea that naval ships would escort commercial vessels, given that hundreds normally travel the route daily, but said the U.S. operation would position ships in areas where they could have the greatest security benefit.IMPACT ON GLOBAL TRADEBP’s decision to temporarily pause all transit through the Red Sea and oil tanker group Frontline’s saying its vessels would avoid passage through the waterway showed that the crisis was broadening to include energy shipments. Crude oil prices rose for a second straight day on Tuesday as the Houthi attacks on ships disrupted trade and more companies were forced to reroute vessels.Shipping companies continued to reroute on Tuesday. Denmark’s Maersk, which had paused Red Sea shipping, said it would sail its ships around Africa until further notice.Maersk said the Red Sea task force was a “positive” development, but said it was seeking more details on how it would work.“With the line of impacted vessels building fast in the area, progressing with speed will be key for the coalition in order to minimise direct negative impact on global trade,” a Maersk statement said.International firms said they were drawing up contingency plans. Sweden’s Electrolux said it had set up a task force to find alternative routes or identify priority deliveries if needed.Many other ships were still plying the Red Sea, though several ships had armed guards onboard, LSEG data showed. A number of container vessels were anchored and others turned off tracking systems as traders adjusted routes and prices in response to the maritime attacks.Industry sources said the impact on global trade would depend on how long the crisis persists, but insurance premiums and longer routes would be immediate burdens.The longer trip will cost up to $1 million extra in fuel for every round trip between Asia and Northern Europe, according to estimates from freight platform Xeneta.Economic policymakers said it was too early to assess the broader financial impact, but the main concern was whether disruption would get serious enough to ignite a new round of global inflation, just as central banks are finally overcoming price pressures after the COVID-19 pandemic.About 12% of world shipping traffic usually transits via the Suez Canal, the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia, passing then as well into Red Sea waters off Yemen.IRAN DENIES BLAMEAustin said on Monday that Iran was behind the Houthi attacks. Iran denies involvement but says it supports its Houthi allies.The European diplomat said the task force aimed to send a strong signal to Iran and its proxies. “There is no doubt Houthis are acting on behalf of Iran,” the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Many major Arab allies of the United States have so far declined to join the task force. Bahrain’s defence minister met Western counterparts to discuss maritime security, an official social media page said on Tuesday, but gave no other details.(Reporting by Phil Stewart, Mohammed Ghobari, Yuka Obayashi, Lisa Barrington, John Irish, Anne Kauranen, Nayera Abdallah, Josephine Mason, Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, Jonathan Saul, Reuters bureaux, Dubai newsroom; writing by John Davison, Alexander Cornwell, Elisa Martinuzzi; editing by Hugh Lawson, Mark Heinrich and Leslie Adler)","December 19, 2023 - 20:11"

But the campaign to raise over $100 billion comes at a time of tight fiscal resources as many wealthier countries pare back spending as their recoveries from COVID-19 slow.Denmark’s pledge of 3.3 billion kroner ($491.7 million), announced at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, represents a major commitment to development and progress toward the goal as financing needs are rising in debt-strapped low-income countries.The World Bank also called it a “deliverable” to African leaders, who have called for an ambitious IDA funding increase.KEY QUOTES:“We all want a more prosperous and equitable world. This financial commitment signifies Denmark’s resolve and dedication in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement. I am proud to answer the call from our African partners for more funding,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said a statement released by the World Bank. “We urge other countries to join forces with us.”World Bank President Ajay Banga said the donation will have a “tangible impact on people’s lives,” adding that every dollar raised by IDA can be multiplied by four times through the bank’s own borrowing capacity.“It’s the best deal in development,” Banga said of IDA.($1 = 6.71 Danish krone)","September 24, 2024 - 00:32"
66,Elusive Hamas leader Deif masterminded Oct 7 attack on Israel,"DUBAI (Reuters) – Hamas’ military leader Mohammed Deif, one of the masterminds of the Oct. 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel, was an elusive figure who had a long and secretive career in the Palestinian group and had been sought by Israel for decades.Deif, 58, was finally killed in an Israeli airstrike on July 13, a huge blow to the militant Islamist group more than nine months after the Oct. 7 attack triggered Israel’s devastating campaign in Gaza. The Israeli military said on Thursday it had confimed his death in the airstrike in Gaza’s Khan Yunis area. Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Israeli announcement. Deif had survived seven previous Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021. In the months since Oct. 7, he was believed to have been directing military operations from the tunnels and backstreets of Gaza, alongside senior colleagues.Rising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group’s network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise.

His survival over the years made him a folk hero for some Palestinians.He and two other Hamas leaders in Gaza formed a three-man military council that planned the Oct. 7 raid, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, in the bloodiest attack in Israel’s 75-year history.After the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government vowed to kill the three – Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Deif, head of the military wing, and Marwan Issa his deputy, who was reported killed by Israel in March.In an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on Oct. 7, Deif named the raid “Al-Aqsa Flood”, signalling the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque.A source close to Hamas said Deif began planning the operation in May 2021, after a raid on Islam’s third holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world. “It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,” the source said. “All this fuelled and ignited the anger.”At the time, Israel accused Palestinians of trying to incite violence in Jerusalem. Palestinians rejected the allegation.The storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting that year between Israel and Hamas.AL-AQSA RAGE There are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast on Oct. 7.Deif, 58, rarely spoke and never appeared in public.

Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,” Deif said in the recording.For Israelis and Western states, the Iran-backed Hamas, which has directed suicide bombings in Israel and fought frequent wars against it, is a terrorist group bent on Israel’s destruction. For Palestinian supporters, Hamas leaders are fighters for liberation from Israeli occupation, keeping their cause alive when international diplomacy has failed them.The source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the Oct. 7 attack was taken jointly by Deif, who led Hamas’s armed wing, known as Al Qassam Brigades, and Sinwar, but it was clear Deif was the architect.“There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,” the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.An Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.DECEPTION EFFORTThe plan as conceived by Deif involved a prolonged effort at deception.

The group had now decided to “put an end to all this”, he said.More than 39,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military campaign since Oct. 7, Gaza health officials say, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble. Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas.In May 2024, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Deif, Sinwar and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Netanyahu and his defence chief over Israel’s response. Both Israel and Hamas dismissed the ICC accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other – though they faced different charges.Born as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Younis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the militant leader became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.He was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.Deif had a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He headed the university’s entertainment committee and performed on stage in comedies.His wife, 7-month-old son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014.

67,New Holcim boss faces long road to decarbonisation,"The challenge that the Sarajevo-born Australian will face from May as the chief executive of Swiss cement giant Holcim will be much the same: figuring out how to slash the carbon footprint of the most widely consumed man-made material without altering its fundamental nature as a cheap binding agent.The 44-year-old’s new role at Holcim, the largest cement manufacturer outside China, comes as the Swiss group pushes to spin off its North-American business next year. An infrastructure boom in the US, fuelled by President Joe Biden’s historic $1.5 trillion spending plan, has boosted demand for building materials, driving up cement prices. Holcim has secured work on more than 100 infrastructure projects in the US until 2026, turbocharging the company’s growth there.Formed from the merger of Switzerland’s Holcim and France’s Lafarge close to a decade ago, Holcim has been among building materials groups that have fallen out of favour with more climate-conscious investors.The US revival for infrastructure leading to the decision to split its business has underscored Holcim’s existential need to decarbonise. Shorn of its fastest-growing business, which contributed $11 billion in net sales, about 40% of the group, the fortunes of Holcim and of Gutovic will be made or broken by its slower growth but higher-margin sustainable-cement business in Europe.Gutovic, who has overseen the European business for the past five years, has also led the group’s decarbonisation push. “We are working on decarbonising Holcim, the construction industry, making our cities more sustainable and we are also driving circular construction,” he said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos.To that end, the company has innovated and promoted low-carbon products as well as selling off some of its more polluting core cement assets, particularly in emerging markets.Under its merger and acquisitions strategy put in place by Gutovic’s predecessor, Jan Jenisch, Holcim has disposed of assets in countries including Brazil, Indonesia and Uganda. Two years ago it sold off its India operations for $10.5 billion to the Adani Group. At the same time, it has been expanding its lower-carbon business, last year acquiring more than 20 companies.Jenisch, who will stay on as chair, hired Gutovic into Holcim in 2018 from the Swiss chemical manufacturer Sika, which the outgoing chief executive previously ran. Gutovic is expected to continue to refocus the company, telling Bloomberg last month the group was looking at 20 acquisitions this year.Some industry executives question Holcim’s commitment to decarbonising the “whole construction industry” when its M&A activity has not solved the notoriously “hard-to-abate” carbon footprint problem facing cement.“The continuing divestments that Holcim has made . . . leads the industry to question whether they’re stepping down as sort of the industry leaders [on climate change],” said Ian Riley, chief executive of the World Cement Association.Holcim’s decarbonisation plan has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, an arbiter of corporate net-zero goals. But as long as the cement industry remains one of the world’s top polluters, responsible for about 8% of greenhouse gas emissions, its leaders will face calls to move faster. Despite scepticism surrounding its claims about industry-wide decarbonisation in some quarters, Holcim has been developing lower- carbon cement products, which use limestone substitutes, and recycles materials such as rubble into the cement. It is also investing globally in less-polluting building materials, including heat-reflective roofing materials.The enduring problem is that much of cement’s footprint comes from the decomposition of limestone when it is heated in a kiln, to create clinker, a crucial ingredient of cement. Hitting net-zero emissions by 2050 will rely on reabsorbing some of the CO₂ released in these processes, for which Holcim is building carbon capture and utilisation plants supported by EU funding.Clay is still on the agenda for Gutovic as a less carbon-intensive cement ingredient. Last year the cement group launched what it said was Europe’s first production line of “calcined clay” for use in cement.Despite Gutovic’s efforts to refocus Holcim’s business, the negative impacts of the legacy business will be hard to avoid.In an ongoing legal case filed last year against Holcim in the Swiss canton of Zug, where it is headquartered, residents of the Indonesian island of Pulau Pari affected by rising flood waters demanded Holcim pay compensation for the costs of their water damage and flood protection measures.Holcim is responsible for 0.42% of global fossil fuel and cement emissions in the atmosphere since the mid-18th century, according to a study by the Climate Accountability Institute research group.The company said when the case was filed that litigation focused on a single company was not “an effective mechanism to tackle the global complexity of climate action”.The EU’s tough regulatory environment will provide a tailwind for Gutovic, by providing a “level playing field”, Holcim executives believe. Brussels has put a high price on carbon-intensive industries, including cement and steel, under its flagship emissions-trading scheme, and will introduce a carbon tax on the most polluting imported goods from 2026.The incoming CEO is counting on government policies as “enablers” of decarbonisation. Speaking at Davos last month, he called for a regulatory framework “to ensure fast execution and deployment of carbon capture technologies” as well as “to accelerate the use of low-carbon solutions”.Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024","February 2, 2024 - 14:00"
68,Environmental protection: Swiss companies struggle with sustainability goals,"More than four out of five board members (82%) recognise the growing importance of sustainability, according to a survey published on Monday by the Swiss Association of Boards of Directors in collaboration with Deloitte Switzerland and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. However, only half of the companies have set sustainability targets that they measure against.In addition, more than half of the 409 board members surveyed (60%) reported difficulties in measuring their own environmental impact. The study thus reveals a considerable discrepancy between the increasing importance of sustainability at companies and its practical implementation, said a press release on the study.+ Switzerland strives for a more sustainable economyThe outlook for the next three years is clear when it comes to sustainability: 84% of respondents expect the importance of sustainable development for their company to continue to increase. The sustainability wave is particularly noticeable in the retail and consumer goods sectors as well as in construction and property.The topic of sustainability is being actively discussed by the boards of directors of large companies in particular (97%). However, according to the study, it has also been on the agenda of board meetings at three-quarters of small companies in the past 12 months. And a large majority of the surveyed board members (82%) feel well equipped to address the topic.Companies are feeling the growing pressure from outside the company to lead the way on sustainability issues, both from politicians via regulations and from customers. Larger companies have been subject to stricter ESG (environmental, social and governance) reporting and disclosure requirements since the beginning of the year.Translated from German by DeepL/ts","February 26, 2024 - 10:24"
69,Switzerland helps bring about climate-resilient agriculture in Zimbabwe,"Mutiusinazita, in Buhera District some 220km south-east of the capital Harare, is one of the driest parts of Zimbabwe. The annual rainfall of 650 to 700mm is not enough to make agriculture profitable. As a result, hunger and poverty are widespread. Jesca Mutero, 46, was a typical resident of Mutiusinazita. Poor and widowed, she tilled a small field that yielded little to nothing each year. Her home was a one-room hut.But in the last four years her life and that of her two children have changed. She now owns 45 goats and has built a three-room house. Four years ago, she got about only on foot; now she owns a motorbike.“Before this project, I was struggling. We cultivated the land, but the harvest often failed. Thanks to the goats we can now make a living,” she says.Mutero is a member of the Mutiusinazita Buhera Livestock Association, a cooperative of 38 women who breed goats. The project is part of the €40 million Zimbabwe Agriculture Growth Programme, launched by the European Union in 2016 to support the country’s livestock sector.In March 2023, the EU and Switzerland expanded their cooperation with Zimbabwe to a €207 million programme, known as the Team Europe Initiative on Greener and Climate-Smart Agriculture.The aim is to establish more sustainable production in Zimbabwe and help vulnerable communities to overcome climate-related challenges.Zimbabwe’s economy is still primarily agrarian, with most of the population dependent on farming for a living. The ever more frequent droughts, cyclones and high temperatures as a result of climate change are endangering the livelihoods of the rural population.Ntuthuko Nyathi, 37, from the arid region of Manama in Gwanda District, some 600km south of Harare, is chairman of the Gwanda Goat Producers Business Association.When the EU first got in touch, he recounts, they were poor smallholders who did not know how to market their produce. They then received training in how to increase production and productivity, improve their financial skills and negotiate better prices.The cooperative members each received two breeder males, crossbred Boer goats and crossbred Kalahari Red goats, as well as material to build goat pens. The Boer goat, from neighbouring South Africa, is large, while the Kalahari Red, from the same country, is very robust. Both are bred for their meat. The members of the cooperative crossed the foreign breeds with local Matebele goats, which are generally smaller and suited to the harsh conditions in Gwanda.“We then started selling the animals across Zimbabwe, bearing in mind that Matebele goats have proven to have good genetics and can adapt to the different climatic regions of Zimbabwe,” says Nyathi.“By adding the foreign breeds to our flock, we were able to tap into a growth market, as the demand for crossbreeds is high,” says the father of three, who now sells between 1,000 and 2,500 goats a year.The €207 million in funding covers all programmes that will be implemented from 2021 to 2027, explains Alexandra Maseko, press and information officer at the EU delegation in Zimbabwe. The EU is contributing €134 million, France €17.4 million, Sweden €21.6 million and Switzerland €34 million.Over 20 support programmes have been launched so far. In addition to more sustainable agriculture, they focus on renewable energy promotion, general livelihoods in rural areas and environmental and nature conservation.According to Maseko, the Team Europe initiative is a good tool for building relations with governments and other partners. The programmes are also geared at building economic sustainability.Richard Nyamanhindi, programme officer for communication and culture at the Swiss embassy in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi, believes that the local coordination of the projects is one of the strengths of the Team Europe initiative. It enables the participants to learn from each other and share successful models. “And we avoid repeating things that didn’t work,” he says.In Mutiusinazita, Mutero says the programme has changed her life. But there are still problems – for instance, when it comes to getting her goats to market in Harare. She complains about the poor road network; travelling on the roads is “a nightmare”, she says.The lack of reliable transportation to market also affects Nyathi and his colleagues. He has appealed to the EU to support the building of abattoirs in the communities, so that livestock can be slaughtered locally and the meat transported to market in refrigerated vehicles.His cooperative also wants to shift its focus from supplying meat to urban markets to selling breeding animals.“One challenge is the drought in our region, so we need to produce animal feed,” he says. “Feed yards, water pipes for irrigation, threshing machines and warehouses – I believe that if all donor countries went down this path, poverty in Zimbabwe would be alleviated.”Anxious Masuka, the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, supports the EU and Swiss initiative. It aligns with the government’s programme launched in 2020, he says.However, the government’s efforts to promote sustainable agriculture are focused on the production of maize, the national staple, as well as small grains such as sorghum and pulses. The authorities have also instructed farmers not to plough their fields before sowing, on the understanding that this disrupts soil organisms and releases carbon dioxide.“This is smart farming, which disturbs the soil as little as possible. If we just dig holes and plant the crops, we leave everything else undisturbed,” the minister says.Climate-proof agriculture is also being promoted at national level through better management of water resources, with dams and boreholes. Today, some 203,000 hectares of agricultural land in Zimbabwe are irrigated. “We want to reach around 350,000 hectares by 2025,” Masuka says. The government’s primary goal is climate-safe crop farming.“But livestock farming can also be made climate-proof,” the minister adds. Given the expected climate changes, animal husbandry in some areas will have to be adapted to the respective agro-ecological zone. In dry areas such as Buhera and Gwanda, the government is favouring smaller animals, such as indigenous chickens and goats.“This is what we are doing and all the development partners, including the EU, are coming to support the government in this endeavour,” Masuka says. In just three years since the government launched its efforts, Zimbabwe has become food secure, the minister asserts, “because we have adopted climate-smart agriculture at both national and household levels.”Edited by Marc Leutenegger.

70,Swiss ‘very satisfied’ halfway through Paris Olympics,"+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inboxThe 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro with seven medals and 23 diplomas (awarded to top-eight finishers) was the target set by the umbrella organisation Swiss Olympic and head of delegation Ralph Stöckli. Halfway through the competitions in Paris, they are well on track. With six medals, the figure for Rio has almost been reached. It was clear from the outset that the 13 medals won in Tokyo three years ago could hardly be regarded as a target. In the second week, there are fewer disciplines on the programme in which the Swiss are strong.On Sunday morning, Stöckli was satisfied with the results so far. “The currency of success is medals,” said the former top curler. “The road is getting rockier. But I also sense that the appreciation for places in the top eight or so is increasing.” He also emphasised the five fourth places achieved by the Swiss team in the first week of the competition.“If the dice had fallen correctly, more would have been possible. But it could also be less.” Together with 21 diplomas already, this impressively demonstrates the breadth of Swiss sport, he said. “That makes me massively proud.”Personally, he said he was particularly pleased with the medals won by the female shooters. Nina Christen did not get up to speed as hoped; Chiara Leone and Audrey Gogniat stepped into the breach for her. As in the past, Stöckli emphasised what he sees as the exemplary transformation of the shooting association from an amateur to a modern professional sport.A recurring theme of the first half of the Paris Olympics is the athletes’ raving about the ambience at the competition venues. Stöckli speaks of a mammoth task that the organising committee has mastered very well. After the usual “organised chaos prior to the opening ceremony”, everything has gone very smoothly, from the village to the arenas to the transport, he said.The sporting success of the French hosts – and the sustained development of the British after the 2012 home games – encourages Stöckli in his endeavours to bring the 2038 Winter Games to Switzerland. “That’s the main motivation,” he said. “You can see what a boost it means for sport.”But first he and his team have to perform well in the second half of the Paris Games.Translated from German by DeepL/ts","August 4, 2024 - 15:01"
71,Stock Bull Run Breaks Record on Fed Decision Day: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Stocks hit fresh all-time highs as the Federal Reserve did little to alter Wall Street’s bets that interest rates will drop at least twice in 2024 — even after the central bank’s more-conservative outlook.The S&P 500 topped 5,400 for the first time in its history, with Wednesday marking the 20-month anniversary of the bull market. While Treasury yields did pare their slide after the central bank decision, Fed swaps are still pointing to rate cuts in both November and December. The dollar retreated against all of its developed-world counterparts.Fed officials penciled in just one rate cut this year and forecast more cuts for 2025, signaling no rush to reduce borrowing costs. “The most-recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective,” Chair Jerome Powell said.“This is a nothing-burger Fed meeting,” said David Russell at TradeStation. “They know conditions are improving, but don’t need to rush with rate cuts. The strong economy is letting Jerome Powell wring inflation out of the system without hurting jobs. Goldilocks is emerging. Policymakers don’t want to jinx it.”A few hours before the Fed decision, data showed the core consumer price index cooled to the slowest pace in more than three years.In a session marked by strong trading volume, the S&P 500 rose almost 1%. Big tech consolidated its leadership, with Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. rallying at least 3.5%. Gains were also fueled by blowout earnings from Oracle Corp., which soared 13%. Lower bond rates also helped, with 10-year yields down nine basis points to 4.32%.“Don’t put the cut before the horse,” said Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Gapen. “This Fed will be reactionary and will ease when the inflation data allow.”Gapen retained his view for the first rate cut in December and a gradual easing cycle that ends with a terminal rate of 3.50-3.75%. Officials on Wednesday voted unanimously to keep the benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.5% — a two-decade high first reached in July.The Fed’s acknowledgement of “modest progress” towards the 2% inflation target likely stems from the disinflationary signals in May’s CPI data, according to Whitney Watson at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.“The Summary of Economic Projections was hawkish as it implies only one cut — but the statement did acknowledge ‘modest’ progress on inflation,” said Jay Hatfield at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “The press conference was neutral as this morning’s low inflation print was hard to ignore.”Individual officials’ views on the best path forward for borrowing costs differed. The Fed’s “dot plot” showed four policymakers saw no cuts this year, while seven anticipated just one reduction and eight expected two cuts.“These ‘dot plot’ projections likely don’t account for the latest May inflation data, which were softer than expected and reversed some of the heat we saw in the first quarter,” said Sonu Varghese at Carson Group. “We still think the odds are high for two rate cuts in 2024 if the disinflation process continues, as we expect.”“On net, while there was a modest surprise in this year’s median dot, we didn’t come away from this afternoon thinking much differently about the Fed,” said Michael Feroli at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “We continue to look for a first ease in November, and after this morning, perhaps see risks tilted a little more toward September than December.”Powell said the officials welcomed the latest inflation figures, adding that he hopes for more reports like that. He said Wednesday’s figures had helped build their confidence on the trajectory of inflation but not enough to warrant rate cuts at this time.  To Krishna Guha at Evercore, the Fed chair is keeping the door very much open to a September cut — provided that the May downshift is broadly sustained in the next few months.“Powell’s presser fine-tunes to a 1.5 cut signal — we still see thin baseline of two,” he noted.“Jay was purposely noncommittal on giving any opinion on the timing of a possible cut,” said Peter Boockvar at The Boock Report. “Whether they cut once or twice after 525 bps of rate increases since March 2022? Who cares? It’s what happens next year and if the cuts are aggressive, it will be because the economy deteriorates notably, more so than if inflation further slows.”“Chair Powell provided a cautious view around the economic outlook, particularly for inflation and despite the better than expected news that we received on that front earlier today,” said Oscar Munoz and Gennadiy Goldberg at TD Securities. “While on the surface the projections appear to have a hawkish tilt, the details suggest otherwise, in our opinion.”They remain optimistic that the Fed will first ease rates at its September meeting, as we look for core personal consumption expenditures inflation to gradually moderate by then to a monthly pace that is consistent with a return to the inflation target.“The Treasury market largely treated the June meeting as a placeholder, with the focus going forward likely to remain on economic data,” they added. “This should keep markets volatile around inflation and labor market data. However, with 10-year rates slipping into a “bullish channel,” we continue to expect them to finish the year at 3.9%,” they added.Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","June 13, 2024 - 00:03"
72,Fully traceable gold – technically feasible or pure fantasy?,"Scientific researchers and companies are in hot pursuit of technologies that can track gold’s journey to within metres of where it was mined, ensuring your rings and necklaces come from an African mine free of child labor or a licensed field in Brazil, rather than a pit unleashing toxic mercury or enriching criminal gangs in the Amazon.“Switzerland has a special responsibility with respect to a reliable and fair gold supply chain,” environmental geophysics professor Niklas Linde told a conference on gold traceability at the University of Lausanne in May.Gold is different from most other commodities traded out of Switzerland because it physically enters the country. About a third of the world’s mined gold and half of recycled gold is processed or refined within the borders of the Alpine nation, Linde noted.Given its position as a top international gold refining and commodities trading hub, Switzerland is fertile ground for companies selling traceability technology.  + From Nazis to refineries: how Switzerland handles the world’s goldDigital and physical traceability technologies specific to precious metals are now on offer from a variety of players. The methods are compatible, so while tech companies might focus on selling the merits of one approach, refiners may use both.For gold, the holy grail is achieving comprehensive traceability from the ground to the refined bar, regardless of whether the supply chain starts at a rudimentary artisanal operation or a large industrial mine. Blockchain solutions are popular but do not cover the entirety of the gold supply chain. Lausanne-based Sicpa , an old-timer in the traceability space, launched Bullion Protect this year – a security seal applied to a gold bar after the refining process.  + What is blockchain?The London Bullion Market Association and World Gold Council launched a joint pilot last year – the Gold Bar Integrity (GBI) programme – to digitally monitor gold’s journey from mine to vault. The programme has tapped two companies, including aXedras, a Swiss distributed ledger company based in commodity trading hub Zug, to develop a digital tracking solution using a blockchain-backed ledger. AlpVision, a Swiss-based provider of digital anti-counterfeiting technology, has also had its Fingerprint solution accredited by the GBI, allowing users to scan a product’s surface with a smartphone app to verify its authenticity.Refineries, meanwhile, are wasting no time testing and developing technologies in-house. Switzerland-based refiner MKS Pamp developed its own blockchain-based traceability solution, Provenance, which it has been using since 2022 to trace precious metals and support its claims that it is sourcing gold responsibly. Swiss refiner Argor-Heraeus uses a spray-on marker from Swiss traceability solutions developer Haelixa to track its gold from industrial mines in South America. That works in a well-controlled supply chain, but critics point out that the marker disappears if the gold is remelted.Everyone wants to become the gold standard for traceability, and it’s a topic that generates heated debate. Geoscientist Barbara Beck was the brains behind the conference at the University of Lausanne that devoted two whole days to the issue – drawing the full spectrum of Swiss traceability companies and gold refiners, as well as law enforcement representatives from both Switzerland and Brazil. Gold traders, regulators, academics, and NGOs that focus on the environmental and human rights impact of gold mining and processing also attended.A networking force of nature, Beck is passionate about the flow of metals across time and space. Her journey began with a PhD in archaeometry – which draws on scientific methods to resolve archaeological mysteries – and deep dives into topics such as silver production in Switzerland’s Wallis region in ancient times.At the University of Lausanne, in partnership with Swiss refinery Metalor, Beck developed a scientific approach to validate the origin of doré, a bar made of precious metals including silver and gold, that is sent to refineries for further purification. The so-called Geoforensic passport, which was unveiled in May 2022, is now routinely used to test doré bars that arrive at Metalor’s refinery in Marin-Epagnier, in canton Neuchatel in western Switzerland. It identifies the chemical composition of the gold to confirm its source.Other Swiss refiners have also taken interest in her method, which builds on existing processes for precious metal analysis used by refineries when they perform routine chemical testing of doré to assess its gold content.Refiners “have to pay for the gold, pay the suppliers, and they need to know the gold content,” explains Beck. “It’s important to know whether a bar contains 50% or 90% gold.”Refiners also test the doré for other elements that interest them – like silver and copper – as well as those that do not, deleterious elements such as selenium or arsenic that refiners don’t like because they are either toxic or more complicated to separate in the refining process.As her method uses the analyses that are already done systematically on doré bars when they arrive at the refinery, there is no extra cost involved, she says. “What I can do with my software is determine right away whether this doré is consistent with other doré from the same supplier or not. When it does not conform, then the audits begin.”Doré bars reflect the chemical composition of a mine [hence the notion of a geoforensic passport]. This allows Beck to distinguish one doré from another by performing a chemical analysis. The method also allows analysis of changes over time. “A doré that comes from a mine two years ago does not have the same signature as a doré today,” notes Beck. “You see an evolution over time in the chemical composition.”Another solution focusing on the most challenging stretch of the supply chain was developed by Zurich-based GeoBlock, a data management company specialising in upstream gold production analytics. Its co-founder, entrepreneur Bruno Regli, has worked in the gold sector since 2009, initially with a focus on mining operations in Colombia. In 2019, he began looking for a solution to provide traceability that starts at the mine, drawing on tests that he conducted at his gold mine in Colombia and others in his network. “We started with gold because we think there is a demand from the banks and the refiners to really know the origin,” says Regli.In the old days, he explains, gold miners would use a spectrometer to read copper, silver, and gold. Today there are next generation spectrometers with a CHF50,000 price tag that allow for richer analysis. GeoBlock’s traceability solution combines analysis of metal elements with statistical calculations to verify that gold originates in a specific geography.“Geology is different all over the world,” he explains. “We analyse all possible elements, often around 40. The machine-learning algorithm tells me which ones are the most significant for testing and which ones follow through the whole supply chain: from the extraction until the doré or to the refinery.” The analysis allows him to verify that a metal comes from a particular area.  How precise is the technology? “On the tests we did in Colombia, we could already see differences between [gold] veins that are 500 to 800 metres apart, location wise,” Regli says.Ultimately, though, it boils down to probability. “We can tell the refiner this material is coming from this area,” he says. “Obviously we cannot tell you if it is coming from the left-hand side or the right-hand side of the river. If the geology is totally different, you can even see it with your own eyes. In fact, usually, with proper visualization, it’s obvious without a statistical test whether material is fake or not.” A few kilometres – or just a few hundred metres – can mean the difference between a legal and illegal mine, a distinction that is one of the biggest headaches of the gold supply chain in Brazil, one of South America’s major producers.   In 2021, Switzerland was the largest buyer of Brazilian gold ($1.26B), just behind Canada, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.But mining in the Amazon region is having a deleterious impact on the land and local indigenous populations. The environment is being polluted due to the use of mercury to extract the precious metal through the process of amalgamation, deforestation is destroying natural habitats, and organised crime is pervasive across the value chain.Stretching across nine countries, the vast Amazon rainforest accounts for one third of the world’s tropical forests, which are vital for the health of the planet. “Illegal gold mining kills and threatens indigenous peoples, it threatens our forests and therefore threatens our future,” Raul Jungmann, president of the Brazilian Mining Association (IBRAM) and a former minister, told the conference in Lausanne.In 2022 Swiss refiners pledged not to take gold from the Amazon but this is a difficult promise to keep. Efforts at due diligence have been complicated by the sheer size of the rainforest and a “good faith” approach to sourcing – declarations by gold sellers of where the gold was mined are accepted at face value.Between 2015 and 2020, Brazil traded 229 tons of gold that showed evidence of illegality, according to a study by the Sao Paulo-based sustainability organisation Instituto Escolhas. The majority of the gold traded by Brazil in 2021 (52.8 tonnes or 54% of national production) may have been illegal, according to the same source. Deforestation was rampant under former president Jair Bolsonaro.A change in government in Brazil this year has ushered in tighter controls on the gold trade and pushed environmental and indigenous concerns up the national agenda. The Gold Provisional Measure, adopted in April, ended good faith sales and mandated electronic invoices for buying, selling, and transporting gold within the country.Brazilian gold trader Andrei Santos, who exports 250 to 300 kilos of gold per month to Switzerland, has doubts about the effectiveness of physical traceability solutions, based on personal experience. “Regionally, I think the idea [of a gold DNA] is beautiful,” he says. “You cannot get gold from let’s say Cuiabá and have the same gold characteristics as gold produced in Venezuela. But for me, that does not guarantee where the gold is actually from.”Cuiabá is the capital city of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which is part of the Amazon region and where his office is based. In one instance, DNA analysis led him to incorrectly conclude that one of his suppliers was smuggling gold from another region. The usual output of this gold producer was 92%-97% gold with few contaminants. But one day the gold produced had different properties: 85% gold, 5% led, 3% iron and some silver.So he took a team to the site to investigate. “I stayed there the entire day, I saw the gold being produced,” says Santos, one of MKS Pamp’s suppliers. “Long story short, I was wrong. Why? Because it is nature. It is not that precise… Gold is not a mathematical equation.”Achieving compliance and peace of mind takes many resources and steps, he says. His compliance department accounts for 40 of the 85 people in his office, and he uses a software programme to flag irregularities. A red light might flash if a mine, typically producing five kilos per month, suddenly sells 15 kilos to the company in one month. A separate company sends geologists to mining sites with GoPro cameras, much like police officers, to carry out checks.“All our mines are under this constant process of monitoring,” he says. “What I want inside my company is 100% traceability… What DNA, what traceability solution can guarantee to me [that the gold] did not come to me from that [illegal] area? It’s not that precise. It is not spot on.”Back in Switzerland, refiners stress the distinction between transparency and traceability. They say it is possible to have a traceable supply chain without necessarily being transparent about everything, arguing that revealing their sources would compromise their competitiveness.At the conference in Lausanne, the CEO of one Switzerland-based refinery proposed that refineries should communicate with the public about the systems and technologies in place but not share their actual data. “We should not reveal our sources, but we should communicate about the systems we have in place to ensure that the sources we have are clean,” he said during a focus group discussion.Those in law enforcement take a different perspective and see traceability solutions as key to supporting their work. “What is important for us is to be sure that the data is confirmed, is a mirror of reality,” said Sylvie Bertrand, the public prosecutor for Geneva, a major hub for Swiss gold traders, during another panel discussion.It is also important for law enforcement officials to have the tools that enable them to read and process the data, and then use it to confront their partners and those suspected of illegal activity, she added. At the end of the day, a court needs to be able to understand the data when presented with a case.Traceability is key for regulators as it allows them to link all the necessary details, said Thomas Brodmann, head of the central office for Precious Metals Controls, which enforces Swiss regulation on gold.“You must be able to link the gold from that Amazon region to that exact refinery,” he told the panel at the Lausanne conference on the feasibility of institutionalising traceability. “If it doesn’t go directly from Brazil to Switzerland but goes through several different countries, and it is melted together, then it becomes very difficult, almost impossible [to make those linkages]. That is the situation today.”","October 18, 2023 - 09:00"
73,Diminished Hamas switches to full insurgent mode in Gaza,"By Samia Nakhoul, Humeyra Pamuk and Jonathan LandayWASHINGTON (Reuters) – Hamas has seen about half its forces wiped out in eight months of war and is relying on hit-and-run insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel’s attempts to take control of Gaza, U.S. and Israeli officials told Reuters.The enclave’s ruling group has been reduced to between 9,000 and 12,000 fighters, according to three senior U.S. officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict. By contrast, Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.Hamas fighters are now largely avoiding sustained skirmishes with Israeli forces closing in on the southernmost city of Rafah, instead relying on ambushes and improvised bombs to hit targets often behind enemy lines, one of the officials said.Several Gaza residents, including Wissam Ibrahim, said they too had observed a shift in tactics.“In earlier months, Hamas fighters would intercept, engage and fire at Israeli troops as soon as they pushed into their territory,” Ibrahim told Reuters by phone. “But now, there is a notable shift in their mode of operations, they wait for them to deploy and then they start their ambushes and attacks.”The U.S. officials, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said such tactics could sustain a Hamas insurgency for months to come, aided by weapons smuggled into Gaza via tunnels and others repurposed from unexploded ordnance or captured from Israeli forces.This kind of protracted timeframe is echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser who said last week the war could last until the end of 2024 at least.A Hamas spokesperson didn’t respond to requests for comment on its battlefield strategy.In a parallel propaganda drive, some of the group’s fighters are videotaping their ambushes of Israeli troops, before editing and posting them on Telegram and other social media apps.Peter Lerner, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), told Reuters they were still some way from destroying Hamas, which he also said had lost roughly half of its fighting force.Lerner said the military was adapting to the group’s shift in tactics and acknowledged Israel couldn’t eliminate every Hamas fighter or destroy every Hamas tunnel.“There is never a goal to kill each and every last terrorist on the ground. That’s not a realistic goal,” he added. “Destroying Hamas as a governing authority is an achievable and attainable military objective,” he added.HAMAS LEADERS SINWAR AND DEIFNetanyahu and his government are under pressure from Washington to agree to a ceasefire plan to end the war, which began on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s subsequent ground-and-air campaign in Gaza has left the territory in ruins and killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. The United Nations says over a million people face “catastrophic” levels of hunger.There are about between 7,000-8,000 Hamas fighters reportedly entrenched in Rafah, the last significant bastion of the group’s resistance, according to Israeli and U.S. officials. Top leaders Yahya Sinwar, his brother Mohammed, and Sinwar’s second-in-command Mohammed Deif are still alive and believed to be hiding in tunnels with Israeli hostages, they said.The Palestinian group has shown the ability to withdraw rapidly after attacks, take cover, regroup, and pop up again in areas that Israel had believed to be cleared of militants, a U.S. administration official said.Lerner, the IDF spokesperson, agreed Israel faced a protracted battle to overcome Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2006.“There is no quick fix after 17 years of them building their capabilities,” he added.Hamas has constructed a 500 km (310 miles) subterranean city of tunnels over the years. The labyrinth, dubbed the Gaza metro by the Israeli military, is roughly half the length of the New York subway system. Equipped with water, power and ventilation, it shelters Hamas leaders, command and control centers, and weapons and ammunition stores.The Israeli military said last week that it had taken control of the entire Gaza-Egypt land border to prevent weapons smuggling. About 20 tunnels used by Hamas to carry arms into Gaza were found within the zone, it added.Egypt’s State Information Service didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel’s claims of arms-smuggling from the country. Egyptian officials have previously denied any such clandestine trade is taking place, saying they destroyed the tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago.ECHOES OF FALLUJA INSURGENCY?The Gaza incursion is Israel’s longest and fiercest conflict since it invaded Lebanon to oust the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1982.Netanyahu has defied domestic and international calls to outline a post-war plan for the territory. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that the absence of such a roadmap could trigger lawlessness in the enclave.One Arab official told Reuters that criminal gangs had already emerged in Gaza amid the power vacuum, seizing food deliveries and conducting armed robberies.The official and two other Arab government sources, who all requested anonymity to speak freely, said the IDF could face similar threats to those encountered by America in the city of Falluja in 2004-2006 following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.A broad insurgency in Falluja swelled the ranks first of al Qaeda and then Islamic State, miring Iraq in conflict and chaos from which it has yet to fully emerge two decades later.Washington and its Arab allies have said they are working on a post-conflict plan for Gaza which involves a time-bound, irreversible path to Palestinian statehood.When the plan, part of a “grand bargain” envisioned by the United States that aims to secure a normalizing of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, is complete, Washington aims to put it to Israel, the U.S. officials said.    A United Arab Emirates official with direct knowledge of the discussions said a Palestinian invitation was needed for countries to assist Gaza in an emergency operation, as well as an end to hostilities, full Israeli disengagement, and clarity on Gaza’s legal status, including control of borders.The emergency process could last a year and be potentially renewable for another year, according to the UAE official who said the aim to be to stabilize the enclave rather than rebuild it.    For reconstruction to begin, a more detailed roadmap towards a two-state solution was needed, he added, as well as serious and credible reform of the Palestinian Authority.How the United States aims to overcome Netanyahu’s repeated rejection of a two-state solution, which Riyadh says is a condition to normalizing ties, is unclear.David Schenker, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, dismissed any suggestion of a clean IDF pullout from the Palestinian territory.“Israel says it’s going to maintain security control which means that it’s going to constantly fly drones over Gaza and they’re not going to be limited if they see Hamas re-emerging, they’re going to go back,” said Schenker, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute U.S.-based think-tank.Gadi Eisenkot, a former Israeli military chief serving in Netanyahu’s war cabinet, has proposed an Egyptian-led international coalition as an alternative to Hamas rule in Gaza.In a closed-door briefing last week to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he emphasized the complex nature of anti-militancy warfare.“This is a religious, nationalistic, social, and military struggle with no knock-out blow but rather protracted warfare that will last many years,” he said.","June 6, 2024 - 07:11"
74,"IMF urges G20 cooperation on climate, global AI principles","By Andrea ShalalSAO PAULO (Reuters) – Medium-term global growth prospects are the weakest in decades, but G20 major economies could boost growth prospects if they work together to address climate change, avoid trade restrictions and adopt worldwide principles for artificial intelligence (AI), the International Monetary Fund said.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva urged G20 major economies to “act boldly” to rebuild policy momentum on reforms after years of “firefighting” in the wake of economic shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.With global growth expected to reach 3.1% in 2024, inflation falling and job markets holding up, policymakers could now focus on rebuilding fiscal buffers against future shocks, boosting domestic revenues, curbing the rise of public debt and ensuring that trends such as AI improve growth prospects, she said in a blog published on Monday to accompany an IMF report to the G20.Georgieva, who will address G20 finance officials when they meet in Sao Paulo this week, said low global growth affected all countries, but had “particularly troubling” implications for emerging markets and developing economies, which have weathered successive global shocks but continue to lag behind advanced economies.She said it was vital for countries to continue to work to broaden their tax base, close loopholes and improve tax administration, noting that the G20 had asked the IMF and World Bank to launch a joint initiative on the issue.The IMF report said it was now expected to take 130 years for emerging markets and developing economies to close half the gap in income per capita with advanced economies, up from around 80 years before the 2008 global financial crisis.Brazil, this year’s president of the G20, has made ending inequality and addressing climate change a top priority.Given the recent improvement in the near-term outlook, with a “soft landing” now in sight, G20 policymakers could set “their sights on a more equitable, prosperous, sustainable, and cooperative future,” Georgieva said.She also said central banks should track inflation carefully and avoid easing monetary policy too soon or too fast.The IMF said medium-term growth prospects remain tepid due to weak productivity growth, aging, fragmentation and climate vulnerabilities, but there are still growth opportunities from trade in digital services, and AI, if properly harnessed.It said G20 leaders should step up efforts to tap Africa’s growth potential and enable greater investments in education, health, and gender equality, and ensure greater coordination on debt restructuring for countries unable to make payments.Cooperation by the G20, including through carbon pricing, reduced energy subsidies and border carbon adjustment mechanisms, could also help mitigate the effects of climate change and facilitate the green energy transition, the IMF said.It called on them to work together to ensure the responsible use of AI, including by upgrading domestic regulatory frameworks and harmonizing global principles for its use.","February 26, 2024 - 17:01"
75,Switzerland now has a Professor of Gender Medicine. She’s here to stay.  ,"As the first academic to ever be named professor of gender medicine in Switzerland, Carolin Lerchenmüller does not want to be seen as a “mascot” or a figurehead. Her main challenge is to raise awareness of the importance of gender medicine, to ensure that her research is reliable, and that her legacy lives on beyond the hype.  “I’ve been extremely busy moving to Zurich, dealing with media and presentation requests, visiting numerous conferences, building my team, filling vacancies and developing our research and teaching programmes,” she tells SWI swissinfo.ch at the University of Zurich, where she is now based.  It took three months to arrange to meet Lerchenmüller, who started her new job on May 1. Her office was not yet fully furnished so we interviewed her in a meeting room on campus.  Gender medicine, also known as sex- and gender-specific medicine, is the study of how sex and gender-based differences influence people’s health. It seeks to better understand gender-specific differences in biology and social behaviour and incorporate these into patient care, teaching and the development of treatments. The discipline emerged in the United States more than 40 years ago, when feminists joined hands with cardiologists to study how heart disease affects women differently than men. In 1993, the US Congress mandated that Phase III clinical trials (the last phase before requesting approval for the drug’s release on to the market) include both sexes in adequate numbers to ensure that the data can be analysed for an effect on gender. It took another 20 years or so for gender medicine to gain momentum and find its way into medical schools in Europe. Sweden took the lead. In 2001, the medical faculty at Umeå University decided to integrate gender perspectives in its medical curriculum.  The country’s Karolinska Institute was the first in Europe to establish a web-based educational course on health and disease from a gender perspective. In 2003, the German cardiologist Vera Regitz-Zagrosek founded the Berlin Institute for Gender in Medicine (GiM), the first interdisciplinary research centre in Europe to take a systematic approach to integrating sex and gender medicine into medical and inter-professional education.   By comparison, Switzerland has been a relatively slow starter. It was only in 2019 that the University of Lausanne’s Centre of General Medicine and Public Health (Unisanté) became the first in the country to introduce courses on the influence of sex and gender on health in its medical curriculum. The country also has a poor record of promoting women in the medical field. In 2017, Switzerland launched the Women in Cardiology (WIC) group, a platform for female cardiologists to share their expertise. Its counterpart was launched in the US back in 1994 and in the United Kingdom in 2005. Lerchenmüller first encountered gender medicine as a cardiologist during her studies at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School between 2013 and 2017. One of her role models at the time was Marianne Legato, an American cardiologist who was the first to recognise and systematically describe differences in cardiovascular diseases between men and women.  “The differences between women’s and men’s hearts were well recognised and actively researched where I worked,” she says of her experience in the US.While men typically suffer from chest pain radiating into the left arm, many female patients display completely different symptoms, including shortness of breath, sweating, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and head or neck pain.    This difference in symptom perception can be fatal: “Doctors have sometimes dismissed life-threatening conditions in women and sent them home,” resulting in a significantly higher risk of misdiagnosing a heart attack in women, says Lerchenmüller. Determined to make her mark in this new field of study, she returned to her native Germany to lead a research group in the Department of Cardiology at the University of Heidelberg, with the goal of studying and incorporating gender differences in her work.  “I was very motivated. I thought, this is my niche! This is where I really want to leverage my new knowledge,” she says. But she was quickly disappointed. Shortly after returning to Europe, she noticed a stark gender imbalance in cardiology in Germany. For example, very few women were invited to give talks at the annual congress of the German Society of Cardiology (DGK) at that time. “That was not a good sign, because it would eventually influence our scientific focus,” she says. This led her to launch an initiative for women at the German Cardiac Society to promote the representation of women in cardiology, especially in leadership positions. She went on to lead the Women and Family in Cardiology group within the German Cardiac Society to build a foundation for evidence-based gender equity and to promote diversity. When the position of Switzerland’s first professor of gender medicine was advertised, Lerchenmüller was one of the few candidates to apply for the professorship at the University of Zurich. The position was advertised as developing individualised diagnoses and therapies for men and women, in order to better understand the needs of men and women in the medical community and the corresponding structures that cater to them.  To support the work, Lerchenmüller is hiring several postdoctoral students and a technician to conduct fundamental research. She will also be researching how to generate high-quality and reliable data based on a systematic review of empirical evidence through international collaborations.  Lerchenmüller says her first challenge will be to go beyond the hype around gender medicine and establish her field of study as a full-fledged academic discipline that can continue to evolve.  “It’s easy to create a new research area or professorship in gender medicine, but it’s quite difficult to make this work sustainable,” she says.  The questions she asks herself don’t come with easy answers. Why do some diseases affect men and women differently? And why do they sometimes respond differently to drugs?  “There is currently not enough data on these differences,” she says. “This is the challenge facing academia, clinical medicine and the pharmaceutical industry.” She points out that there are many data gaps that have developed over decades and need to be filled. One reason is the underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. This bias continues when drugs are developed and manufactured. “It’s probably fair to say that most of the drugs we use are designed for the 80-kilo white male,” says Lerchenmüller.Lerchenmüller says it will take decades to close the data gap. As an example, she cites the fact that differences in heart attack symptoms between men and women were known as early as the 1990s but it took another 20 years or so for these differences to be mentioned in European guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice.  “There has to be solid data to confirm and explain the differences we have observed, in order for those differences to be recognised in guidelines,” Lerchenmüller explains. Although many have complained that the pace of change in gender medicine is slow, Lerchenmüller disagrees. She believes that it takes time to produce high-quality, reliable evidence to create guidelines that can be translated into clinical care and be applied worldwide. “It’s necessarily a very slow, very careful process,” she says. One of the most striking and cautionary tales of gender disparities driven by insufficient data and inaccurate science is the controversy surrounding Zolpidem, sold under the brand name Ambien in the US.  The drug, commonly prescribed as a short-term solution for people suffering from insomnia, is best known for being the cause of deadly headline-grabbing car accidents. In a landmark decision in 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration recommended

that women take half the dose of the drug compared to men. The FDA cited new data published by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research

, which indicated that women were at higher risk of cognitive side effects the next day that impacted driving. The data showed that this was because women metabolise the drug more slowly than men. This was the first and to date only sex-specific drug authorised by the FDA in the US.  However, several researchers
External link
have since questioned the reasoning behind the FDA’s recommendation, saying that it lacked “concrete evidence”. They say the FDA’s recommendations may led to under-medication for many women suffering from sleep disorders. One major task for Lerchenmüller and her team will be to connect databases and find more collaborations at the national and global levels to collect data on gender differences.  Three months into her job, Lerchenmüller says she is pleasantly surprised by the quality of research in Switzerland. “The research and healthcare work in gender medicine that’s being done here is really great – far beyond my expectations,” she says.  Over the past two years Switzerland has been catching up on developing the field in its medical curriculums. The universities of Bern and Zurich launched the country’s first advanced training in sex- and gender-specific medicine

in autumn 2020. Their aim is to present tools, concepts and ideas on how healthcare and medical research in various medical disciplines can be gender equitable.  The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) launched a call for the Swiss National Research Program to research “Gender Medicine and Health”
External link
at the end of 2023, with a budget of CHF11 million ($13 million), out of a total annual budget of CHF47 million. Approximately 140 pre-proposals were submitted by 389 researchers, almost half of all applications submitted for all national research programmes. The next evaluation phase will take place this fall.Like other female physicians and researchers, Lerchenmüller says her personal life is scrutinised differently than that of her male colleagues. She remains elusive about how she is juggling raising three children alongside a challenging job. She wants to keep the focus of the interview on her work and her vision, rather than on the fact that she is the first woman and – first person – in Switzerland to hold such a position. She believes that real progress to advance women in healthcare and medicine depends on making the entire field more diverse and equitable.  Edited by Virginie Mangin/gw","September 20, 2024 - 09:00"
76,Western powers tangle over Russian assets at G20 finance meeting,"By Andrea Shalal, Christian Kraemer and Marcela AyresSAO PAULO (Reuters) – Western powers butted heads over how to handle frozen Russian assets on Wednesday as G20 finance ministers kicked off a discussion of challenges for the global economy, trying to set aside deep geopolitical divisions.Brazilian officials hosting the two-day meeting in Sao Paulo sought to focus talks on economic cooperation to tackle issues such as climate change and poverty, proposing a joint statement that avoids direct mention of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.Yet the geopolitical issues hanging over the event soon spilled into the open, with even close allies divided over what to do with Russian assets blocked by Western powers.Those fissures were visible after ministers from the Group of Seven major democracies gathered early on Wednesday before the G20 proceedings, debating whether the frozen assets could finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday said she believed there was a strong basis in international law to unlock value from the Russian assets, as collateral or by seizure.But French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire argued on Wednesday that there is not enough basis in international law to seize the Russian assets, emphasizing that such a move would require the endorsement of G20 members and other countries.“We should not add any kind of division among the G20 countries,” he told reporters. “If the legal basis is not sufficient … you will create more divisions at a time when we need more unity to support Ukraine.”Their disagreement underscored tricky geopolitical terrain for the G20 group of major world economies, whose foreign ministers last week in Rio de Janeiro vented deep divisions over the war in Ukraine and Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.Brazil’s coordinator of the G20 finance track in Sao Paulo, Tatiana Rosito, said negotiations for the economic portion of the group’s communique were successfully completed by deputy ministers in a “very positive” atmosphere.A draft version of the communique, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, made only a passing reference to regional conflicts.But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said his country will only agree on the G20 communique if geopolitical issues such as the war in Ukraine are mentioned.Speaking after the end of the G20’s first-day session, Japan’s vice finance minister for international affairs, Masato Kanda, said work on the G20 communique was still going on.“There are many areas that still need discussion, including those outside of geo-political issues. It’s hard to predict how everything will play out,” Kanda told reporters.Brazil is trying with its presidency of the G20 to shift discussions away from geopolitical tensions between major powers and toward a consensus on sustainable development, while trying to give developing nations of the Global South more voice.In his address opening the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad proposed a global minimum wealth tax, representing a potential new pillar for international tax cooperation.Haddad had already suggested the G20 tackle tax havens for the most wealthy and inheritance taxes favoring the super-rich.Brazil’s central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto called the fight against inflation a crucial tool for combating inequalities, one of Brazil’s priorities in the G20 presidency.While acknowledging recent progress in disinflation since the pandemic, Campos Neto called for persistence.“There is still work to be done in the last mile, and risks remain ahead,” he said.","February 29, 2024 - 04:01"
77,"Cate Blanchett calls for focus on education, refugee experience at forum","By Johnny CottonBRUSSELS (Reuters) – Education for refugees, supporting host countries and hearing personal accounts of those forced to flee their homes should be the focus of the second Global Refugee Forum this week, says UNHCR goodwill ambassador Cate Blanchett.Politicians, diplomats, charities, businesses and refugees meet in Geneva Dec. 13-15 for what the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) calls the world’s largest international gathering on refugees. It is held every four years.Joining them will be Blanchett, who travelled to Jordan, Niger and South Sudan this year as part of her humanitarian role.“It’s important to focus on the education quadrant and really supporting host communities,” Blanchett told Reuters.“The other thing is that the (United Nations’) Sustainable Development Goals have been acknowledged that they will fail unless refugees are at the heart of (them) so I think it will be really important for people to hear the voices of refugees themselves about what they need and how they can be part of the solutions.”Conflicts, poverty and climate change have driven a record 114 million people from their homes around the world, the UNHCR said in October, while Western governments are under growing domestic pressure to get tougher on asylum seekers, with some considering schemes to deport them.“There are overlapping reasons why people move and so we need to … find places where we have sophisticated adult conversations that are compassionate and humane,” Blanchett said.“We can’t discuss this nor solve this in soundbites. And then by pushing people to Albania, to Rwanda, to Manus, to Nauru, it only creates yet another set of problems.”Blanchett, a two-time Oscar winning actor, was named a UNHCR goodwill ambassador in 2016, a role including advocacy, fundraising and meeting refugees in different countries.This year, she returned with UNHCR to Jordan, which hosts some more than 600,000 Syrian refugees, after visiting seven years ago. She travelled to Niger and South Sudan, and joined UNHCR’s High Commissioner Filippo Grandi to meet Congress members in Washington.Last month, she addressed the EU parliament in Brussels, urging the EU to step up support of refugees and host countries.“I do think that Europe has had a history of being incredibly supportive to host countries who are near the point of conflict and departure,” Blanchett told Reuters.“But if you make that investment and you don’t make good on that investment, then that is money wasted.”This week’s forum is expected to result in more pledges from states and civil society in areas such as education, labour market access, climate change mitigation and resettlement. Some heads of state and other senior politicians are due to attend alongside development and faith groups as well as refugees.In 2020, Blanchett starred in and produced drama “Stateless”, which looked at asylum and detention.“Works of art, films … provide a platform, an opportunity and a coming together to talk about things that are really difficult to talk about,” Blanchett said.“Not necessarily to find an answer but to keep the dialogue alive.”(Reporting by Johnny Cotton; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Alison Williams)","December 11, 2023 - 06:17"
78,"Bank of England to start cutting rates in Q3, most likely August","(Corrects number of answers for June and May in paragraph 14)By Shaloo ShrivastavaBENGALURU (Reuters) – The Bank of England will start cutting interest rates in the third quarter, a Reuters poll of economists showed, with a slim majority expecting the first reduction in August.That is later than forecast in a January poll, when a small majority of economists saw the rate cut cycle starting next quarter, although the latest result also was a very close call.Reuters surveys since August have consistently predicted the first 2024 cut would come in Q3, except last month’s poll that predicted Q2.An August rate cut would mean the BoE will lag the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, which are expected to start lowering borrowing costs next quarter, according to separate Reuters polls.A raft of stronger than expected UK economic data and comments from several Monetary Policy Committee members, who said they needed more evidence of fading price pressures, prompted some economists to lean towards a Q3 cut.Inflation remained steady at 4.0% in January, unchanged from December but much lower than the 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022.The BoE raised interest rates 14 times from December 2021 to August 2023 to calm inflation, taking Bank Rate to a 15-year peak of 5.25%.Britain’s economy has been grappling with high inflation and borrowing costs, and entered a shallow recession in the second half of 2023.But some MPC members were less worried about recession as the economy showed signs of picking up, and said they were in no rush to loosen policy.Median forecasts in the Feb. 15-20 poll of 66 economists showed Bank Rate will stay at 5.25% until a fall to 4.75% in the third quarter, then ending the year at 4.50%.“We think it will take several more months for the Monetary Policy Committee to feel confident enough in disinflation in order to cut rates. We see the first Bank Rate cut this August,” said Chris Hare, senior economist at HSBC.“While the labour market remains tight and while wage growth remains elevated, the sustainable return to 2% (inflation) is not assured.”Slightly more than half of economists forecast the first cut to come in Q3, with around 42% – 28 of 66 – predicting it would come in Q2. One said Q4 and one more expected no cuts this year.Asked which month the BoE will start cutting, of 45 who answered, 23 said August, 11 said June, seven said May, three said September and one said February 2025.Of 12 gilt-edged market makers who answered the question, seven said August, four said May and one said June. August was in line with market pricing.Bets by investors on interest rate cuts in 2024 were not unreasonable, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday.However, when asked what is more likely on the timing of the first cut, economists were split. Of 36 who answered, 18 said that it would come sooner than they expect and 18 said later.“The Bank of England is concerned that both wage growth and services inflation could be stickier and slower to come down, and that would potentially push back the timing of the first cut,” said James Smith, developed markets economist at ING.Inflation was predicted to fall sharply, averaging 3.5% this quarter, 2.0% in Q2 and 1.8% in Q3 – below the BoE’s 2% target. It was seen averaging around target through 2025.Median forecasts showed inflation averaging 2.5% this year, 2.1% next year and 2.0% in 2026.The British economy grew only 0.1% in 2023 and is predicted to expand 0.3% this year. A bounce to 1.1% and 1.4% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively, is expected.(For other stories from the Reuters global economic poll:)","February 20, 2024 - 18:01"

80,"IMF to launch new Ukraine mission to review loan, latest economic developments","By David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) – The International Monetary Fund will start a new Ukraine mission in coming weeks to assess the war-torn country’s $15.6 billion loan program and latest economic developments there amid stepped up Russian military pressure, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said on Thursday.The loan review mission also will revise the IMF’s analysis of Ukraine’s debt sustainability, Kozack said. That assessment will influence the country’s efforts to restructure $20 billion of debt with bondholders before a payment freeze expires at the end of August.In March, the IMF executive board approved the third review of Ukraine’s Extended Fund Facility loan program, resulting in an $880 million disbursement.Kozack said the IMF hoped that an agreement on the fourth review could be brought up for board approval by the end of June. The IMF typically bases disbursement amounts on program reviews and performance towards reform goals.“The Ukrainian economy has shown remarkable resilience. Although the Outlook does remain subject to exceptionally high war-related uncertainty,” she said. “The authorities have made good progress for their EFF commitments under very challenging conditions.”But since the last review, Russia has stepped up its missile attacks on Ukrainian power infrastructure, forcing it to import record amounts of electricity. Russian forces have also opened up a new front in the northeast close to Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv.The U.S. Congress has also approved a long-delayed $61 billion military and economic aid package for Ukraine. The IMF has previously estimated that Ukraine will need about $42 billion in external budgetary support this year.Asked about deliberations by Western industrial democracies to harness the income from frozen sovereign Russian assets to aid Ukraine, Kozack said the IMF’s position has not changed: that this was a matter for relevant jurisdictions and courts to decide.“What is important for the Fund — for us — is that any action that is taken has sufficient legal underpinnings and does not undermine the functioning of the international monetary system,” Kozack added.","May 16, 2024 - 20:10"
81,"G20 ministers agree world trade to foster sustainable development, enhance women’s role","BRASILIA (Reuters) – Ministers from the G20 group of largest economies agreed on Thursday that international trade and investments should foster sustainable development and enhance the participation of women in world trade.They also agreed on the need to speed up reform of the World Trade Organization to achieve a “faster, more agile and effective,” conflict resolution system, Brazil’s Vice President and Trade Minister Geraldo Alckmin told reporters.The proposals agreed by G20 trade ministers meeting in Brasilia will be proposed to the group’s leaders at the annual summit hosted by Brazil in November in Rio de Janeiro and be annexed to their joint statement.It is the first time the G20 has addressed the issue of increased inclusion of women in international trade, Alckmin said, adding that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had insisted on it becoming a G20 principle.Brazil, which will host the COP30 climate talks next year, also gave priority to the need to fight climate change and proposed that the G20 should call for trade and investments that encourage environmentally sustainable economic development.Lula has also made reform of global governance institutions a priority and the ministers agreed to support WTO reform and the strengthening of a multilateral trading system, a Brazilian government statement said.“We stressed the importance of a rulesbased, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core. We will work to ensure a level playing field and fair competition to foster a favorable trade and investment environment for all,” the statement said.The one-day meeting avoided divisive issues, though members expressed their views on Russia and Ukraine and the situation in Gaza, with some wanting them discussed in the G20 and others saying it was not the right forum, the Brazilian statement said.“There were disagreements in drafting the texts and things were dropped, but at the end there was consensus on everything, including the proposal on women in international trade,” said an Asian diplomat who attended the meeting.","October 25, 2024 - 00:52"
82,Children work in Swiss chocolate maker Lindt’s supply chain in Ghana,"Lindt & Sprüngli, which is based in Kilchberg in canton Zurich, has developed a sustainability programme

for its cocoa farmers. The programme promises to reduce the risk of child labour, address deforestation, and preserve biodiversity.The reality on the ground, however, is far from perfect, as Swiss public television, SRF, discovered when it investigated cocoa plantations near the town of Tepa in western Ghana.SRF’s report revealed a number of children working in Lindt & Sprüngli’s supply chain. In the village of Mfenibu, for example, six-year-old Kennedy and his eight-year-old brother Ebenezer were collecting and carrying cocoa pods.“I have to rely on the children,” said their widowed grandmother, Lucy Ajubie, a cocoa farmer. She explained that she was in debt.Lindt & Sprüngli declined to comment on camera. In a written statement it explained that the systemic factors leading to child labour are very difficult to influence. The company stressed that “fighting child labour requires efforts on the part of governments, non-governmental organisations, companies, local institutions, schools, and farmers”.Lindt & Sprüngli sources cocoa from roughly 80,000 farmers in Ghana, making it one of the leading cocoa buyers in the country.In 2016, the chocolate manufacturer introduced measures designed to prevent child labour: it makes unannounced visits to its cocoa farmers. Over the course of 8,491 surprise visits in 2021, the company discovered 87 child workers. Ghanaian journalist Kwetey Nartey feels the number of cases reported by Lindt – roughly one per 100 visits – is “laughable”. He believes “the monitoring carried out by the chocolate companies is insufficient”.Some chocolate makers do, however, report a much higher incidence of child labour. In its most recent inspection, Swiss chocolate giant Barry Callebaut, the world’s top producer of cocoa products, recorded 53,839 children working for roughly 250,000 farmers in West Africa.Lindt & Sprüngli accounted for its numbers by explaining that “the methods used to identify child labour differ among chocolate manufacturers”. The company added that it is “constantly trying to improve [its] identification system”.To reduce the risk of child labour, Lindt & Sprüngli created its sustainability programme – the “Farming Program” – to support producers. SRF’s investigation showed, however, that the company has neither a branch office nor employees on site in Ghana.Instead, the chocolate manufacturer has outsourced its farming programme to ECOM, a Swiss raw-materials group and one of the world’s largest cocoa traders. ECOM is Lindt & Sprüngli’s official supplier of Ghanaian cocoa beans. Lindt responded that it is nonetheless fully engaged: “We constantly support and oversee the implementation of the Farming Program.”Child labour is a problem for many chocolate companies, not just for Lindt & Sprüngli.

83,EBRD says its support for Ukraine exports not impacted by European protests,"By Libby GeorgeLONDON (Reuters) – Growing political opposition to Ukrainian grain exports through Europe will not impact the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development’s efforts to help Ukraine get its products to market, the bank’s chief told Reuters.EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso said the bank still aims to launch a scheme with the private sector this year to insure inland cargo transportation, and continues to work on the so-called “solidarity lane” that has allowed Ukraine to channel more than half its grain exports via Europe since the war began.Renaud-Basso said protests that have seen Polish farmers block Ukrainian border crossings and call for restrictions on Ukrainian agricultural products because they were worried about unfair competition, were not impacting the EBRD’s work.“The world needs the products from Ukraine… and also for Ukraine to be able to sustain its own economy, war effort and so forth, they need to have resources and be able to export,” she said.She added that “quite a number” of EBRD projects are aimed at facilitating Ukraine’s transit of goods, including railway, road and port works as well as storage capacity and other logistics.The EBRD is one of the top lenders to Ukraine’s private sector, and its board last year approved a 4 billion euro capital increase aimed at enabling it to boost its support.Earlier this month, insurance broker Marsh and Lloyd’s of London underwriters announced an expansion of a marine war insurance programme backed by Ukraine from grain shipments to all non-military cargo, such as iron ore and steel.Renaud-Basso said the EBRD was now focused on the insurance mechanism for inland transport.“We hope it will be up and running within the course of the year,” she said.The EBRD has deployed 1.5-2 billion euros annually since the war began. While the capital increase would enable the lender to double support, that is only likely to happen if the country is no longer in active conflict and reaches a reconstruction phase.She added that if financial support from the United States to Ukraine were to decline, that could impact the EBRD’s activities, as it would hit Ukraine’s economy.“We monitor that very closely.”","March 19, 2024 - 18:03"
84,COP28 focus on health draws $777 million to fight tropical disease,"By Gloria Dickie, Elizabeth Piper and Alexander CornwellDUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates and several charities at the U.N. climate summit on Sunday offered $777 million in financing for eradicating neglected tropical diseases that are expected to worsen as temperatures climb.Climate-related factors “have become one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century”, COP28 President Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber said in a statement.The pledges, made as the COP28 summit on Sunday focused on climate-related health risks, included $100 million from the UAE and another $100 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Others to announce funds for climate-related health issues included Belgium, Germany and the U.S. Agency for International Development.The World Bank launched a program to explore possible support measures for public health in developing countries, where climate-related health risks are especially high.The burden of tropical diseases will worsen as the world warms, along with other climate-driven health threats including malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.Many tropical diseases are already easy to treat. River blindness and sleeping sickness, for example, are both endemic to Africa and spread through parasitic worms and flies that are likely to proliferate in a warming world.More than 120 countries have signed a COP28 declaration acknowledging their responsibility to keep people safe amid global warming.The declaration made no mention of fossil fuels, the main source of climate-warming emissions, which the Global Climate and Health Alliance called a “glaring omission”.Activists including physicians in white coats held a small demonstration on Sunday within the COP28 compound to raise awareness of the issue.“We are in a lot of trouble,” said Joseph Vipond, an emergency physician from Alberta, Canada. He recalled the case of a child dying from an asthma attack made worse by smoke inhalation from Western Canada’s record wildfires this year. “This is having real world impacts.”Climate change is also increasing the frequency of dangerous storms and more erratic rainfall.In September Storm Daniel killed more than 11,000 people in Libya, and last year’s massive flooding in Pakistan fueled a 400% increase in malaria cases across the country, according to the World Health Organization.Earlier on Sunday, Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates said scientists were working on new treatments for and prevention of mosquito-spread malaria as the rise in temperatures creates more hospitable habitat for the insects to breed.“We have new tools at the lab level that decimate mosquito populations,” said Gates, whose foundation supports public health research and projects for the developing world.“These new innovations give us a chance, at a reasonable cost, to make progress.”Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also spoke on Sunday, urging reform to the world’s insurance system as another key requirement to keep people safe.“Right now insurance companies are pulling out of so many places, they’re not insuring homes, they’re not insuring businesses,” Clinton said, addressing a panel on women and climate resiliency.“It’s people everywhere who are going to be left out with no backup, no insurance for their business or their home.”___For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here.(Reporting by Gloria Dickie, Elizabeth Piper and Alexander Cornwell; Additional reporting by Simon Jessop, Kate Abnett and William James; Editing by Katy Daigle and Jan Harvey)","December 3, 2023 - 14:18"

SRF last week that he is “moderately optimistic” that both sides can now work on a negotiating mandate to update the accord.But there is resistance in some Swiss political circles. An expanded agreement without a human rights clause could face a Swiss referendum launched by left-wing parties and organisations.In March 2021, the Swiss government adopted its first ever China foreign policy strategy (2021-2024 period) intended to create “greater coherence” in its relations with Beijing. The strategy recognises China as an important partner for Switzerland’s foreign policy and provides a framework for the many ties between them. It also recognises clear differences in values between the two nations. The strategy set out objectives and measures in the areas of peace and human rights, prosperity, sustainability and digitalisation.The current strategy is set to expire at the end of this year and will be replaced by a new four-year policy that the Swiss foreign ministry is currently working on. But it is uncertain whether this will involve any major changes or new doctrine.The Alpine country has been holding regular bilateral human rights talks with Beijing since 1991.Swiss-Chinese relations are a “balancing act”, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis admitted to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) in 2021. “On the one hand, we have difficult discussions with China about human rights, but on the other hand, the country is an important partner in economic and other issues,” he said.Dialogue on human rights stalled after Switzerland supported a United Nations demand in 2018 for the closure of controversial Uyghur camps in China’s Xinjiang region. Talks only resumed in July 2023.When he unveiled the China strategy in 2021, Cassis said Switzerland would be more critical on human rights and that this represented a policy shift. Reacting to this, China’s ambassador to Switzerland Wang Shihting strongly rejected any Swiss criticism of the human rights situation in the Asian country.In 2022, Switzerland refused to follow the EU in imposing sanctions on some Chinese individuals and companies over alleged human rights abuses targeting the Uyghur population. The Alpine nation has also stuck to its “One China” policy, which mandates keeping diplomatic relations with only one sovereign state recognised under the name of China. The Swiss paper Le Tempssaid

87,Rejected biodiversity initiative enjoyed strong Swiss Abroad support,"Sunday’s vote resulted in a double slap in the face for the two losing campaign teams: reform of the country’s occupational pension scheme was rejected by 67.1% of the electorate – and all cantons. And the popular initiative on biodiversity was turned down by 63% of voters. All but two cantons, Geneva and Basel City, rejected the idea of giving nature more space and resources.The Swiss Abroad tend to vote differently than the Swiss resident population, although only 12 out of 26 cantons provide relevant statistics after a vote to be able to review this.Previous votes on the environment and pension showed major differences of opinion between the two groups – and Sunday’s ballots were no exception.In contrast to the situation at the national level, most Swiss voters abroad supported the biodiversity initiative.Similar differences were observed during the June 2023 vote on the Climate Act (when the “yes” vote by the Swiss Abroad was much bigger than that of the resident population) and in June 2021 with the CO2 Act (narrowly rejected overall but approved by more than 72% of the Swiss Abroad.)Other votes on the environment, such as the initiative “For a pesticide-free Switzerland” or “For clean drinking water”, were also clearly rejected by resident voters, but approved by the diaspora.The breakdown by canton clearly shows this difference. The biodiversity initiative received over 50% of the Swiss Abroad vote in seven of the 12 Swiss Abroad districts, while it was only accepted in two cantons – Geneva and Basel City.According to Martina Mousson, a political scientist at the gfs.bern research institute, a “pattern is emerging” whereby the Swiss Abroad vote more in favour of environmental issues.“This has to do with the demographics of this group, which is generally more left-wing and more concerned about the environment. They also have a higher level of education and tend to approach issues with a more global vision,” she said. The fact that the “yes” vote won in the cantons of Geneva and Basel, “which are among the most urban and cosmopolitan in Switzerland”, supports this theory, she added.Were the Swiss Abroad less exposed to the various campaign arguments? Mousson believes they were less concerned and less receptive to certain domestic issues raised by opponents, in particular the idea that the initiative would have exacerbated the housing shortage.But the differences are not huge, she said, adding that it wasn’t so much the content of the proposal but rather “the ideological vision that people have of ecology”, that mattered.The “no” vote to the reform of the occupational pension scheme also dominated in all Swiss Abroad districts – like back home. But the rejection was not as big – quite the opposite.The “yes” vote was reported in nine of the 12 districts for which statistics on the Swiss Abroad are available. Swiss Abroad voters from Geneva were the only ones to reject the reform outright. In the end, the “no” vote in all these districts abroad won by a margin of 600 votes.On the issue of pensions, in the past Swiss Abroad voters have been more liberal than the resident population. This was the case last March, for example, when their rejection of a retirement age of 66 was weaker, or in September 2022, when the Swiss diaspora gave more support to raising the retirement age for women from 64 to 65.The fact that such projects only marginally concern the Swiss Abroad certainly helps to explain the difference in voting behaviour. Another possibility is that, since the challenge of making pension systems sustainable is shared by most developed countries, expatriates may be a little more open to reform.As to Sunday’s vote, it is also possible that the doubts about the urgency of reform, raised in Switzerland by the miscalculation of the forecast for the expenditure for the old age and survivors’ insurance (OASI) [state pension system], were less prevalent among the Swiss Abroad. “The Swiss Abroad were less immersed in this discussion and this atmosphere of mistrust,” said Mousson.At the national level, 44.5% of Swiss citizens turned out to vote, a lower turnout than in recent nationwide votes. The average turnout over the past five years has been just under 50%. Among the Swiss Abroad, turnout was also low: 20.7%, compared to an average of 25.6% for recent votes.This low turnout could be a reflection of the complexity of the pension reform. “When they don’t feel in a position to judge, the Swiss tend to abstain from voting,” said Mousson.Edited by Samuel Jaberg; adapted from French by DeepL/sb","September 23, 2024 - 15:44"
88,Australia PM: Chinese navy incident that injured diver was ‘dangerous’,"By Kirsty NeedhamSYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a Chinese warship acted in a dangerous manner during an incident with an Australian navy vessel that injured a military diver, his first comments on the matter which he said had damaged ties.HMAS Toowoomba – a long-range frigate – was conducting a diving operation in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone on Nov. 14 to clear fishing nets from its propellers when the incident occurred, Defence Minister Richard Marles said on Saturday.Albanese, who met briefly with Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in San Francisco last week, has come under domestic political pressure over whether he raised the matter with the Chinese leader.In an interview on Monday with Sky News Australia, Albanese said the incident hurt one person and showed the need for “communication guardrails” between militaries.“This was dangerous, it was unsafe and unprofessional from the Chinese warship,” he said.Albanese said the incident was raised through “all of the normal channels”, but didn’t disclose if it was discussed in his private meeting with Xi at APEC.“The consequences of these events are that they do damage to the relationship. And this certainly is an event that does do damage. And we’ve made that very clear to China,” he added.A People’s Liberation Army Navy destroyer closed towards HMAS Toowoomba, despite the Australian vessel notifying the Chinese warship of a diving operation, and operated its hull-mounted sonar in a manner that posed a safety risk, Marles previously said.Medical assessments found minor injuries to divers likely caused by the destroyer’s sonar, the defence minister added.Albanese visited China this month, the first Australian leader to do so in seven years, agreeing to restart an annual leaders dialogue.China’s embassy in Australia referred to comments by China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a regular media briefing in Beijing on Monday, that China’s military “is always highly disciplined and conducts professional operations in accordance with international law and international practice”.“We hope the relevant party will stop stirring up trouble at China’s doorstep and work with us to jointly sustain the momentum of the improvement and development of China-Australia relations,” she added.(Reporting by Kirsty Needham; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Bernadette Baum)","November 20, 2023 - 12:29"

90,Switzerland’s high hopes at the 1992 Earth Summit,"“It was the biggest diplomatic event of all time” – these were the solemn words of Federal Councillor Flavio Cotti when he faced the press in Bern on June 22, 1992 alongside foreign ministry press spokesperson Marco Cameroni after spending two whirlwind weeks in Rio. Interior minister Cotti – who had led the Swiss delegation at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) because the foreign minister, René Felber, was absent due to cancer – could barely hide his disappointment at the outcome. Although he did not count himself among the “dreamers” in the run-up to the conference, he told the press that he had hoped for “somewhat more tangible results”.The UNCED took place from June 3 to 14, 1992 in the Brazilian coastal metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. It was only the second major international environmental conference hosted by the United Nations after the Stockholm Conference of 1972. The Rio Earth Summit was attended by a record 10,000 delegates from almost 180 countries. More than 100 heads of state and government convened to negotiate solutions to global environmental problems.The preparations for the UNCED kicked off with a resolution by the UN General Assembly in December 1989. The international community subsequently held numerous meetings to prepare for the main conference in 1992. Switzerland was actively involved in this preparatory work from the outset. According to the strategic objectives of Switzerland’s fledgling environmental policy at the time, it primarily wanted to see a substantive climate convention with specific emissions reduction targets.Switzerland’s commitment initially became apparent at the Second World Climate Conference in November 1990 in Geneva. Swiss President Arnold Koller gave a memorable speech to the representatives of the international community in attendance, in which he outlined how Switzerland intended to stabilise emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 through a CO2 levy.Owing to domestic political differences, however, this plan was never implemented. Nevertheless, Switzerland continued to support effective action at international level, such as unblocking the negotiations on the Framework Convention on Climate Change ahead of the UNCED. Only thanks to a joint initiative by Federal Councillor Cotti and Brazilian education minister José Goldemberg was it even possible to reach a compromise, draft a convention capable of winning a majority and present it at the Conference in Rio for parties to sign.On June 12, 1992, Cotti signed this very Climate Change Framework Convention on behalf of Switzerland. The next day, in his speech at the plenary session, Cotti appeared disappointed with the substantive outcome of the conference, which he deemed “to consist of too many declarations of intent and general commitments that need to be fleshed out and further developed”. Nevertheless, he considered the “Rio summit to be an important breakthrough on the path to sustainable and environmentally-compatible development”.True to Switzerland’s foreign policy tradition, Swiss diplomacy got to work immediately after the launch of UNCED in 1989 to bolster the status of International Geneva in the area of the environment. Thanks to generous funding from the Swiss government, the Secretariat coordinating the preparatory work for the UNCED was based in Geneva, and the crucial second and third rounds of negotiations were also held there. A direct consequence of the conference was the founding of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, which coordinated the follow-up work from the UNCED within the UN System. Switzerland ran a major campaign to try and attract the Commission’s Secretariat to Geneva, too. Although the majority of UN Member States came out in support of Geneva, UN Secretary General Boutros-Ghali decided on his own to locate the Secretariat in New York.The signing of the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio marked the beginning of the Conferences of the Parties – known as COPs – that continue to be held today. The 28th COP (COP28) took place in Dubai from November 30 until December 13. Following the successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement in 2015, an initial global stocktake of the measures to reduce emissions is to be carried out at this year’s COP in the United Arab Emirates. This is likely to be a sobering experience. The outcomes of the last two COPs in Glasgow and Sharm El-Sheikh, and the growing polemic around the appointment of the CEO of one of the world’s biggest oil and gas firms as chair of the Conference in Dubai, suggest that the “starting shot for sustainable and environmentally-compatible development” that was fired in Rio is steadily losing momentum.","January 8, 2024 - 11:00"
91,Landlocked Switzerland’s taste for seafood is raising a stink,"Just before Christmas, Greenpeace Switzerland accused the major supermarket chains Coop and Migros of heavily discounting salmon to stimulate the consumption of unsustainably raised fish. Research carried out over three months showed that the retailers were selling farmed North Atlantic salmon at discounts of between 41% and 50%. According to Greenpeace, the two retailers generate more than 45% of their sales from fish products via discount sales – the highest share of sales in the food sector. “Industrial aquaculture only exacerbates the problem in the oceans. In terms of sustainable development, the only coherent action is to offer less fish,” said a Greenpeace press release
External link
on December 18.  The Swiss consume an average of nine kilos of seafood a year, according to the Federal Office for Agriculture. A review of the Swiss fish market
External link
published in 2021 by researchers from the University of Bern estimated that the Alpine nation imports 96% of all the fish consumed. Interviews and surveys of local producers, trade representatives, retailers, restaurant and food service (RFS) providers, quality-management specialists, labelling organisations and associated NGOs, revealed flaws in sustainability claims and a lack of transparency. “Furthermore, even when analysing the Swiss fish market through a limited sustainability lens, only around 40% of consumed products may be considered sustainable. This figure is even more severe within the RFS sector, where sustainability has a very low priority,” state the researchers.  Norway remains the number one source of Swiss seafood imports, thanks to its status as a farmed salmon powerhouse.  According to WWF, salmon aquaculture is the fastest growing food production system in the world. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates the global production of farmed Atlantic salmon to be 2.72 million tonnes a year compared to a mere 20,000 tonnes four decades ago.  “These fish farms are nothing more than intensive farming at sea. They seriously harm the environment and the animals,” said Barbara Wegmann, a consumer expert at Greenpeace Switzerland, in the press release.  Pollution caused by fish waste and pesticides against parasites, as well as interbreeding of escaped fish with wild salmon are some of the negative consequences of salmon farming. According to Vanessa Jaiteh, a seafood sustainability researcher at the University of Bern, salmon raised in aquaculture are often treated with antibiotics and have antibiotic resistance. The same is true for most aquaculture in Southeast Asia which should concern Swiss seafood lovers given that the second largest source of imports is Vietnam. A survey of 360 fish farms and 360 shrimp farms in North, Central and South Vietnam
External link
revealed that antibiotics were widely used in 64% of fish farms and 24% of shrimp farms in 2021.  “People are worried about microplastics but not about their Christmas meal salmon full of antibiotics,” Jaiteh told SWI swissinfo.ch. What is not so well known is that the farmed salmon industry also affects people living on the other side of the world.  “Norway feeds their fish with small pelagic fish from places like Mauritania and Senegal depriving the locals of a cheap source of protein,” says Jaiteh.  The fishmeal and fish oil companies cause environment damage with their waste and manage to obtain good deals from local governments who turn a blind eye.  “Consumers first look at price, then the region where the fish comes from and then perhaps at labels,” says Jaiteh.  However, those opting for local fish and hoping to make a sustainable choice are also misled.  “Salmon raised in Switzerland come from eggs brought in from Iceland. A lot of grey energy is used to give the salmon the environment to grow,” says Jaiteh.  Labels can also deceive. For example, a can of tuna may say the fish have been caught using “pole and line”, which means a pole was used by a fisher to haul in fish one at a time per pole. But the fine print reveals that the fish were caught by “longlines”, which is a fishing line that can be tens of kilometres long with thousands of hooks attached to it.  “Yes, Switzerland requires the fishing method to be declared but the categories are too broad and the language too ambiguous,” says Jaiteh.  There are also problems with sustainability labels like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). For example, MSC allows fishing with super trawlers
External link
that use nets that can hold as many as 13 jumbo jets and damage the seabed and are responsible for a lot of bycatch. Last year, the ASC was criticised by over 40 civil society groups
External link
for not assessing the sustainability of a third of a “responsibly farmed” salmon’s life between hatchery and final growout farm stage.  “The information is not difficult to obtain. The problem is that so many people benefit from not revealing it,” says Jaiteh.  According to the researcher, consumers need to do their research but given that most people eat only a few kinds of fish like salmon or tuna, it is better to focus on these species. The researcher has a few tips for consumers to avoid supporting the worst practices of the fishing and aquaculture industry.  Moderation is another way to reduce impact on global fish stocks.  “We in Switzerland can eat other things. Coastal communities should be able to have fish on their plates,” says Jaiteh. Given that meat in Switzerland costs 2.3 times more than in the European Union

92,Swiss gravity battery contributes to China’s energy transition,"It is an imposing building without doors or windows. Inside there are 3,500 “bricks” weighing 25 tonnes. A system of elevators and tracks moves them up and down, placing them next to each other, in what looks like a modern 3D Tetris. It is not a new housing concept, but a battery that uses the force of gravity to store and release energy.The first battery with this technology was connected to the power grid in the Chinese county of Rudong, near Shanghai, in late 2023. “We didn’t imagine that our first plant would be built in China,” Robert Piconi, CEO of Energy Vault, tells SWI swissinfo.ch. The energy storage systems company is based in the US, but it developed and tested its prototype in Switzerland.In China the environmental imperative to accelerate the country’s decarbonisation – China is the world’s biggest emitter – and current energy policies

have, however, offered unexpected opportunities for Energy Vault and its innovation. New battery-buildings are already under construction. “We want to help solve the climate crisis,” Piconi says.Energy storage systems are an essential part of the energy transition

. Batteries solve one of the main problems of electricity production from renewable sources: volatility. That is, they allow excess electricity generated by the sun or wind to be stored and made available at times of increased demand. They can also help stabilise electrical grids. The challenge is to produce efficient batteries without consuming raw materials and rare metals. And of course, at sustainable costs.Gravity batteries can store large amounts of energy. They do not deteriorate, and the storage capacity does not decrease over time, as is the case with the electrochemical batteries used, for example, in our smartphones.Gravity batteries are based on the same principle as hydroelectric power plants with a pumped storage system. These account for over 94% of the world’s installed energy storage capacity, according to the International Association of Hydropower.However, the Energy Vault battery does not work with water, but with weights. In this case, blocks of concrete or waste material.When the sun or wind produces more electricity than required, as in summer, the excess energy feeds a system that lifts the weights and places them on the upper floors of the battery-building. This process converts electrical energy into potential energy.When the electricity is needed, the blocks descend to the ground or to a lower level at a controlled speed. During the “fall” they drive electric generators, transforming the stored potential energy into electric current. The computer software developed by Energy Vault, the heart of the innovation, optimises the mechanical process of lifting and lowering the blocks according to the electricity demand.Energy Vault’s first commercial battery in China stands next to a wind farm. It has a storage capacity of 100 megawatt hours (MWh). Once “charged”, it could power around 4,600 electric cars travelling 100 kilometres.>> Watch the short animation on how the Energy Vault gravity battery works:The Rudong battery is part of the “new energy storage demonstration pilot projects” defined by China’s National Energy Administration, according to Energy Vault.The plant was built in cooperation with the American Atlas Renewable and China Tianying, one of the leading companies in waste incineration for electricity production. The company uses waste materials and coal ash to make some of the battery blocks. It has invested $100 million (CHF91 million) in Energy Vault.Yan Shengjun, president of China Tianying, claims that Energy Vault’s “revolutionary technology” will facilitate the shift from fossil fuels to solar and wind power and accelerate China’s energy transition. Chinese decision-makers appreciate the possibility of using local raw materials to build the facility and its lifespan of more than 35 years, according to an article in Forbes

.Three such batteries are under construction in China and six more are in the planning stage. Together they will have a storage capacity of 3,700 MWh.Larger installations will reduce costs, says Robert Piconi. The cost of future installations will be at least 30% lower than that of the first battery in Rudong (about $500 per kilowatt-hour of installed storage capacity), he says.Wenxuan Tong, a researcher at the Smart Grid Research Institute in Beijing, believes that gravitational energy storage technology will play a “critical role” in achieving national climate goals. China wants to reach peak emissions in 2030 and climate neutrality in 2060.The Energy Vault battery could be realised almost anywhere. It does not depend on specific geographic or climatic conditions. An energy efficiency similar to that of pumped storage hydroelectric power plants (80-85%) and the simplicity of its equipment make it “cost-effective”, Wenxuan Tong tells SWI swissinfo.ch.However, he points out that the economic effectiveness of a large-scale plant and its compatibility with China’s existing power grid are still to be verified. “More research and practice are needed to verify its efficiency and reliability,” he says.Energy Vault is not the only company using gravity to store and release energy. Other concepts use inclined planes or underground installations. The Canadian company Gravitricity, for example, is building the world’s first underground gravity energy storage prototype in a disused mine in Finland.The main advantage of gravitational batteries is the low energy storage costs, according to Julian Hunt, a researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. The disadvantage, however, is the relatively high cost of the electricity needed to move a weight from one level to another.“Thus it only makes sense to apply gravity storage for weekly, monthly or seasonal storage cycles,” Hunt writes in an email to SWI swissinfo.ch. For storage of less than 12 hours, electrochemical batteries are a more practical and cheaper alternative.The Energy Vault battery in China operates on a four-hour cycle. This is a feature required by the authorities and the electricity grid operator. The system could also release energy for a longer period, but in this case the power output would be lower.Robert Piconi agrees that gravitational batteries are better suited for longer charge and discharge times. However, the demand for long-term energy storage is still small. “It will increase when there are more renewable energy plants connected to the grid,” he predicts.The CEO of Energy Vault is not only looking at China. Energy storage projects are already underway in the US, southern Africa and Australia.The gravitational battery could also be a solution in some European countries, Piconi believes. For example, in nations that are building new wind farms or large solar power plants, such as Spain or Italy. Or in those that are leaving the coal era behind and could use the waste (ash) to make blocks of material to be lifted. “I’m thinking of Germany and Eastern European states,” he says.There appears to be ample opportunity, provided the local populations do not reject battery buildings on aesthetic grounds, as is often the case with planned wind and solar farms.","April 25, 2024 - 09:00"
93,Explainer-What are the security deals Ukraine is discussing with allies?,"By Tom BalmforthKYIV (Reuters) -Germany signed an agreement on security commitments with Ukraine during a visit on Friday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to Berlin. France is expected to do so later in the day when Zelenskiy meets President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.WHAT ARE THESE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS?The Group of Seven nations signed a joint declaration at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July last year, committing to establish “long-term security commitments and arrangements” with Ukraine that would be negotiated bilaterally.The deals would commit to the continued provision of military and security aid, support to develop Ukraine’s defence industrial base, training Ukrainian soldiers, intelligence sharing and cooperation, and support for cyber defence.The sides would also immediately hold consultations with Ukraine to determine “appropriate next steps” in the event of a “future Russian armed attack”.More than 30 countries have since signed the declaration.WHAT DOES GERMANY COMMIT TO?Germany and Ukraine have agreed that in the event of a future Russian attack, either side could request consultations with next steps to be decided within 24 hours.If Germany sees a need to act, it would provide Ukraine “with swift and sustained security assistance, modern military equipment across all domains as necessary, and economic assistance”, according to the agreement, which is valid for ten years.The countries also agreed to continue working to ensure that the costs to Russia for its aggression continue to rise, including through sanctions and export controls.WOULD THIS BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP?Kyiv says the arrangements should contain important and concrete security commitments, but that the agreements would in no way replace its strategic goal of joining NATO, which regards any attack launched on one of its 31 members as an attack on all under Article Five.WHO HAS SIGNED DEALS SO FAR?Britain in January became the first country to sign one of the security agreements with Ukraine for a term of 10 years, by which time Kyiv hopes to be inside NATO.London said the deal formalised a range of support that Britain “has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defence industrial cooperation”.Under the agreement, Britain committed to hold consultations with Kyiv within 24 hours if Ukraine faces a future Russian armed attack, and to provide “swift and sustained” security assistance. London would provide “modern military equipment across all domains as necessary, and economic assistance; impose economic and other costs on Russia”, it said.Ihor Zhovkva, the Ukrainian president’s foreign affairs adviser, said there were also supplements in the British agreement that had not been made public.WHICH OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SET TO SIGN DEALS?Ukraine has held at least two rounds of talks on the agreements with all the G7 countries, Zhovkva said. More than 10 countries are in the active stage of talks or potentially starting soon, he said before Germany had signed the agreement. The additional countries include the Netherlands, Romania, Poland and Denmark.The French accord would outline the framework for long-term humanitarian and financial aid, support for reconstruction and military assistance.However, it could stop short of providing specific financial commitments on weapons’ deliveries as Paris would need to return to parliament for approval. Macron would instead make announcements in public and has said France will send a regular supply of air-to-surface missiles and long-range cruise missiles.WHAT DOES UKRAINE WANT FROM THE DEALS?Zhovkva singled out as “very important” the provision in the British deal, and later in the German deal, under which consultations could be held within 24 hours to provide swift and sustained aid.This, he said, went beyond the “infamous” 1994 Budapest Memorandum under which Ukraine was provided with security “assurances” by Britain, Russia and the United States in return for relinquishing nuclear weapons from its territory.“We do not want to repeat the infamous experience of the Budapest declaration, which just remained a declaration,” he said.Zhovkva said there was no need for Ukraine to rush to agree deals. “I don’t need 10 or 15 agreements concluded within one week. Rather I would have this same 10 or 15 agreements deeply thought over, well-negotiated and with concrete signs of long-term and varied support for Ukraine,” he said.(Additional reporting by Olena Harmash in Kyiv, John Irish in Paris, Alexander Ratz and Miranda Murray in Berlin; Editing by Ros Russell and Nick Macfie)","February 16, 2024 - 17:02"
94,Swiss government exerted pressure to increase public transport fares,"Public transport fares will rise by an average of 3.7% on December 10, the first increase since 2016. By law, prices are set by the companies in the sector, which are members of the SwissPass Alliance, as the Sunday paper SonntagsBlick pointed out. However, a confidential document obtained by the German-language newspaper shows that the Federal Office of Transport (FOT) put pressure on the industry to raise fares. The document is a letter from FOT Director Peter Füglistaler, dated March 27, 2023, addressed to the companies, the relevant cantonal offices and other tariff setters.Füglistaler called for tariff measures to be implemented by 2024 at both national and regional level. As far as the latter is concerned, the federal authority even said it expected tariff measures to be “above average”.Contacted by SonntagsBlick, the FOT believes that “the autonomy of the transport companies in terms of fares has remained guaranteed”. The only source of indirect influence for the cantonal and federal authorities is the level of subsidies, it points out. But these must also take into account the interests of taxpayers, the FOT added. Because of the poor state of federal finances, the Federal Council decided at the start of the year to cut spending on regional public transport.The SwissPass Alliance also believes that it has retained control over the setting of fares despite this letter from the FOT. After discussions with the official price watchdog Stefan Meierhans, adjustments were made to mitigate the 4.3% increase initially planned.In May this year, however, Meierhans did observe a certain amount of pressure from the authorities on the industry: “According to verbal indications from decision-makers, de facto price sovereignty is severely limited”, he wrote in a letter.According to SonntagsBlick, the Swiss Federal Railways has long been opposed to any price increases. In a presentation by its “Sustainable Financing” working group to representatives of the Federal Office of Transport and the Federal Department of Finance on October 27, 2021, it was stated that the company “is not planning any price adjustments until 2030, not least because of the uncertainties associated with the development of post-Covid traffic”.According to the presentation, the fact that pricing measures have nevertheless been discussed in the public transport sector was “at the instigation of the FOT and the cantons”.Since October 2021, however, energy prices have risen sharply, driven in particular by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.","October 16, 2023 - 09:00"
95,Russia strikes Ukraine’s power grid in ‘most massive’ attack of war,"By Pavel Polityuk, Tom Balmforth and Yuliia DysaKYIV (Reuters) -Russia attacked Ukraine with more than 200 missiles and drones on Monday, killing seven people and striking energy facilities nationwide, Kyiv said, while neighbouring NATO member Poland reported a drone had probably entered its airspace.Power cuts and water supply outages were reported in many areas, including parts of Kyiv, as officials said the attack – 2-1/2 years since the full-scale invasion – targeted power or other critical infrastructure across the country.Russia stepped up its strikes on the Ukrainian power grid in March in what Kyiv has said looked like a concerted effort to degrade the system ahead of next winter when people need electricity and heating most.The air force downed 102 out of 127 incoming missiles and 99 out of 109 drones, Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram, describing the attack from the air, ground and sea as “the most massive” of the war.According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, 15 regions sustained damage. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said there was “a lot of damage in the energy sector”.U.S. President Joe Biden condemned Russia’s strikes as “outrageous.” In a statement on Monday, he added that Washington will continue surging energy equipment to Ukraine to repair its systems and to support Ukraine’s energy grid.Zelenskiy said he had discussed Ukraine’s response to the attack with his top commander: “We are preparing it.”Russia’s defence ministry said its forces used high precision weapons to strike important energy infrastructure in Ukraine which it said supported the military-industrial complex. It listed power substations, gas compressor stations and storage sites for aircraft weapons.Ukraine has claimed new ground in a major cross-border incursion into Russia’s western Kursk region while Russian forces steadily have inched forward in Ukraine’s east, closing in on the transport hub of Pokrovsk.After meeting top officials, Zelenskiy said a decision had been taken “further strengthen” the Pokrovsk front, which saw at least 56 combat clashes on Monday, according to the military.POLISH AIRSPACEPoland said a search was underway after an “object” entered its airspace and possibly landed on Polish territory.“Most likely it was a drone and we assume so, because the trajectory of the flight and the speed indicate that it was definitely not a missile,” Jacek Goryszewski, spokesperson for the Polish army’s operational command, told Reuters.Two Russian drones crossed the border into Belarus, Ukraine’s air force commander said.Top Kyiv officials again urged their allies and arms suppliers to allow long-range strikes into Russia.Zelenskiy also redoubled his call for allies to join the country in shooting down missiles and drones over Ukrainian airspace.Ukraine had no powerful long-range weapons at the start of the invasion, but has since developed many models of long-range attack drone and used them to hit targets deep inside Russia, ranging from oil refineries to military airfields.Over the weekend, Zelenskiy said Ukraine had developed a new “drone missile” that had been used to attack Russia and was more powerful and faster than other hardware in Kyiv’s arsenal.DAMAGED FACILITIESAt least 47 people were injured, including four children, emergency services said.The regions that reported strikes on power or critical infrastructure included Volyn and Rivne in the northwest, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west, Zhytomyr in the north, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad and Vinnytsia in central Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia in the southeast and Odesa in the south.Zelenskiy said some civilian facilities were attacked with cluster munitions.Neighbouring Moldova, whose grid is linked to that of Ukraine, reported small disruptions to its power network.Ukraine’s foreign ministry official said a hydropower plant in the Kyiv region had been targeted. A video posted on social media and verified by Reuters showed a damaged dam and a fire after an apparent strike at a plant. A separate clip, also verified, showed a missile hitting a water reservoir.In the northeastern Sumy region, from where Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia on Aug. 6, authorities said a railway infrastructure facility had been struck, but did not say which one or give further details.A 69-year-old man in the Dnipropetrovsk region and a farmer in the Zaporizhzhia region were among at least seven people confirmed dead, local officials said. The others were in the regions of Kharkiv, Zhytomyr and Volyn.In Lutsk, an apartment block was damaged, the mayor said after reporting explosions.Blasts also shook central Kyiv and air defences engaged incoming targets on the outskirts.At least 11 TU-95 strategic bombers were used during the attack, the air force said.Both Russia and Ukraine deny deliberately targeting civilians. Each says its attacks are aimed at destroying infrastructure critical to the other’s war effort.(Additional reporting by Gleb Garanich and Anastasiia Malenko in Kyiv and Barbara Erling in Warsaw; writing by Tom Balmforth and Lidia Kelly; editing by Mark Heinrich, Angus MacSwan, Ros Russell and David Gregorio)","August 27, 2024 - 00:59"
96,G20 welcomes recommendations to unlock funding for climate transition projects,"By Marcela AyresWASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of funds backed by the world’s 20 largest economies aimed at financing climate transition projects needs to be more targeted and operate with greater efficiency to improve the slow pace of disbursements, according to a report on Thursday from the G20’s sustainable finance working group.The G20 stated that because climate and environmental funds have different accreditation and programming requirements, current mechanisms present “fragmented and time-consuming” pathways for accessing their resources.Together, the Green Climate Fund, Climate Investment Funds, Adaptation Fund, and Global Environment Facility have an annual commitment capacity of $4 billion to $5 billion, with disbursements totaling $1.4 billion in 2022. Their disbursement-to-approval ratio ranges from 76% for the Global Environment Facility to 31% for the Green Climate Fund.The data is part of an independent review authorized by the G20, which noted that while these funds represent a small volume relative to other public and private sources, they provide concessional resources that are key to supporting an effective climate transition in developing and low-income economies.The independent review recommended climate funds adopt targeted measures to enhance efficiency, including streamlining accreditation processes, shortening project approval times, and accelerating disbursements.The recommendations include collaboration to harmonize procedures in support of integration and the reduction of transaction costs, aiming to work as a system.The review also urged climate funds to proactively support investment platforms built by countries, shifting from a focus of supporting individual projects to country-driven strategies.“Monitoring of the effective implementation of the report’s recommendations will be conducted over the next G20 presidencies in collaboration with the vertical climate and environmental funds, noting its voluntary nature,” the G20 sustainable finance report said. Brazil has used its G20 presidency to push for ways to boost financing for developing countries, arguing they are falling behind in the transition to low-carbon economies while increasingly bearing the brunt of the impact of climate change.The country’s finance track coordinator, Tatiana Rosito, said the recommendations for climate funds, as well as a roadmap for reforming multilateral development banks to boost their lending capacity, were significant outcomes of the gathering of G20 finance ministers, given their connection to the need to mobilize more resources for financing the climate transition.Brazil’s Environment Minister Marina Silva, speaking alongside Rosito in a press conference at the IMF and World Bank meetings, said the national leaders who will gather at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November “will be drawing from this groundwork.”“Even in a geopolitical context of heightened tensions, which could have hindered our ability to reach consensus, it was possible to foster an understanding that the climate issue requires a collective effort and extensive cooperation, regardless of our differences,” Silva said.(Reporting by Marcela Ayres; Editing by Dan Burns and Paul Simao)","October 25, 2024 - 10:59"
97,Swiss banks to benefit less than global peers from high interest rates,"In an analysis for 2023, management consultant McKinsey expects the average return on equity to rise to 13% from 12% the year before.+ How the wealth management industry is changing in SwitzerlandThe past 18 months represent arguably the best window of opportunity for the financial industry since 2007, McKinsey wrote Wednesday. As recently as 2010, the average return on equity was only 9%, it said. The ratio puts profit in relation to equity as a measure of how efficiently companies have used their money.Overall, McKinsey projects a profit for the entire sector of about $1.4 trillion (CHF1.34 trillion) in 2023, a doubling since 2017. It said the average core capital ratio for financial institutions reached a 10-year high of 13.8%. For the global figures, McKinsey analysed data from the world’s 1,000 largest banks.However, the Swiss industry has only been able to partially benefit from this development due in part to comparatively lower interest rates, according to the release. Overall, the average return on equity in Switzerland for 2023 is expected to be well below the global average, Christian Zahn, head of the Swiss Banking & Insurance Practice at McKinsey, is quoted as saying in the statement.Due to structural differences though, the Swiss financial center has higher margins compared to many other European markets. The country also benefits in particular from its continued strength as the largest offshore center in private banking, with a total volume of $2.9 trillion in invested assets and a continued growth rate of 3% in 2018 – 2022, it said.McKinsey sees the “green transformation” of the economy, which requires significant investment, as an opportunity for the industry. For Switzerland, the consulting firm estimates the associated financing volume in areas such as transport, buildings and energy provision at CHF700 to 800 billion by 2050. The sustainable transformation of the economy can only succeed if banks can provide the financing and financial infrastructure for it, it says.","October 11, 2023 - 11:05"
98,EU to impose duties of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles,"(Reuters) – The European Commission said on Wednesday it would set provisional duties of up to 38.1% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, a move likely to draw possible retaliation from China.COMMENTARY:CarmakersOLIVER ZIPSE, CEO, BMW“This decision for additional import duties is the wrong way to go. The EU Commission is thus harming European companies and European interests.“Protectionism risks starting a spiral: Tariffs lead to new tariffs, to isolation rather than cooperation. From the BMW Group’s point of view, protectionist measures, such as the introduction of import duties, do not contribute to successfully compete on international markets. Free trade remains the BMW Group’s guiding principle. Our company is committed to this.”VOLKSWAGEN:“Countervailing duties are generally not suitable for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry in the long term – we reject them …“The timing of the EU Commission’s decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEV vehicles in Germany and Europe … The negative effects of this decision outweigh any potential benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry.”STELLANTIS:“As a global company Stellantis believes in free and fair competition in a worldwide trade environment and does not support measures that contribute to the world fragmentation…“Stellantis is agile to adapt and take advantage of any scenario and today’s tariff announcement will not deter our overall strategy with respect to Leapmotor in Europe, as we have taken this potential development into account.”OLA KAELLENIUS, CEO OF GERMANY’S MERCEDES BENZ:“As an exporting nation, what we do not need are increasing barriers to trade. We should work on dismantling trade barriers in the spirit of the World Trade Organisation.”CUI DONGSHU, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CHINA PASSENGER CAR ASSOCIATION:“The EU’s provisional tariffs come basically within our expectations, which won’t have much of an impact on the majority of Chinese firms.”FRANCE’S PFA CAR LOBBY GROUP:“… the EU market is the most open in the world. However, in the context of the historic transformation it is facing, the sector has never been more in need of a level playing field: competition, yes, but fair competition.“The European authorities’ guidelines in favour of all-electric vehicles from 2035 … only reinforce the requirement to defend European interests against any possible anti-competitive practices.”HILDEGARD MUELLER, PRESIDENT OF GERMANY’S VDA INDUSTRY BODY:“This measure further increases the risk of a global trade conflict … The potential damage that could result from the measures now announced may be greater than the potential benefits for the European – and in particular the German – automotive industry.”ACEA, THE EUROPEAN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS’ ASSOCIATION:“ACEA has consistently affirmed that free and fair trade is essential in creating a globally competitive European automotive industry, while healthy competition drives innovation and choice for consumers. Free and fair trade means guaranteeing a level playing field for all competitors, but it is just one important part of the global competitiveness puzzle.”CHINESE EV MAKER NIO, WHICH WILL INCUR A 21% TARIFF:“We strongly oppose the use of increased tariffs as a strategy to obstruct the normal global trade of electric vehicles. This approach hinders rather than promotes global environmental protection, emission reduction, and sustainable development.“In Europe, NIO’s commitment to the EV market remains unwavering, and we will continue to serve our users and explore new opportunities within Europe despite protectionism. We will closely monitor the situation and make decisions that align with the best interests of our business. As the ongoing investigation has yet to reach a conclusion, we remain hopeful for a solution.”CHINESE AUTOMAKER CHERY, WHICH HAS ANNOUNCED A CAR FACTORY IN SPAIN AND FACES A 21% TARIFF:“Chery Europe regrets the EU Commission’s decision and continues to hope for fair competition.The most important task now is to clarify the details of the planned implementation, particularly with regard to the technical differentiation between imports and locally produced vehicles.The necessary information is not yet available.”SPANISH CAR MANUFACTURERS’ ASSOCIATION ANFAC:“ANFAC traditionally defends free competition in the market, regardless of where a commodity comes from, as long as all transactions are carried out in compliance with current international trade legislation and have occurred under conditions of equality. If there is someone who fails to comply, he must be penalized for it.“The automobile annually contributes more than 18 billion euros of positive trade balance to the Spanish economy, and our future depends on the survival of a global and open market in which to develop the competitiveness of our industry.“Likewise, we defend that the European Union, and especially Spain, develop a strong industrial policy that encourages the production and manufacturing of electric vehicles in our country, and attracts new investments, all in a manner compatible with free trade and regulation of defence of competition.”GovernmentsLIN JIAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON:“What I want to emphasize is that this anti-subsidy investigation is a typical case of protectionism. For this reason, the European side imposed tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, which violates the principles of market economy and international trade rules, damages China-EU economic and trade cooperation and the stability of the global automobile production and supply chain. It will ultimately undermine Europe’s own interests.“We urge the EU to abide by its commitment to support free trade and oppose protectionism, and work with China to safeguard the overall situation of China-EU economic and trade cooperation. China will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”TERESA RIBERA, ENERGY MINISTER, SPAIN:“I believe that the European automotive industry is an extremely important industry that needs to catch up in terms of the transformation of models, of mobility proposals and to move towards electric cars.“Obviously, if this breach of international trade rules occurs, we must support the Commission’s proposal and obviously it is also our obligation to support the European automobile industry as a whole and, in particular, the Spanish industry, so that it remains a competitive, modern, up-to-date industry with a significant weight in international markets.”ITALY’S INDUSTRY MINISTER ADOLFO URSO:“I welcome the EU’s announcement.”Analysts and expertsVINCENT SUN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR“Unlike the US market where imports of China-made EVs have been negligible, we believe the import levies imposed by the EU will put pressure on sales for Chinese EV manufacturers in the near term.“However, we think Chinese producers are still competitive compared with their rivals. The commission estimates that prices of Chinese EVs are typically 20% lower than prices of EU-made equivalent models. With additional tariffs, Chinese cars are at similar prices, but with more attractive designs and vehicle technology.“In addition, the tariffs will apply not only to Chinese carmakers including BYD and Geely, but also to global automakers such as Tesla and BMW, which export EVs from China to Europe. In the medium term, we do not think the import levies will derail Chinese EV manufacturers’ expansion plans to set up factories in Europe. The increase in local production in the EU could largely offset the impact of tariffs.”EDUARDO BAPTISTA, EUROPEAN UNION CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CHINA“The Chamber believes that if tariffs are to be levied, it should be done proportionately and in a manner that is both transparent and consistent with WTO rules. It is also important to note that the EU’s EV anti-subsidies investigation is just entering its provisional stage and that definitive measures, if taken, will only be confirmed at the end of the year.“The provisional announcement of tariffs underlines the urgency of finding solutions to the very real imbalances in the commercial relationship between Europe and China, in particular if such imbalances arise from factors not reconcilable with the principles of free and fair trade.”FRANK SCHWOPE, AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY LECTURER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES FHM HANNOVER:“The tariffs have turned out to be lower than many feared and are initially a plan that can still be revised. The measures are a disaster for European car buyers and for German car manufacturers. The heads of BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz had clearly spoken out against such punitive tariffs.“China is by far the most important sales market for all German car manufacturers. However, French car manufacturers, for whom China is an insignificant market, would benefit from measures against Chinese imports to Europe. Punitive tariffs will of course provoke countermeasures from the Chinese government.”WILL ROBERTS, HEAD OF AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH AT RESEARCH FIRM RHO MOTION:“Chinese manufacturers should be able to absorb some of these lower tariff levels into their padded profit margins.“The true test from today’s announcement will be whether Beijing will retaliate in kind, or come to an amicable solution. Europe’s manufacturers still rely on the Chinese market, so declining profits from the East would only slow their ability to transition effectively.”JULIA POLISCANOVA, EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP TRANSPORT & ENVIRONMENT:“The EU Green Deal came with the promise of growth and jobs, and that’s not possible if our EVs are all imported. The tariffs are welcome but Europe needs a strong industrial policy to speed up electrification and localise manufacturing. Just introducing tariffs while scrapping the 2035 deadline for polluting cars would slow down the transition and be self defeating.”ANDREW KENNINGHAM, CHIEF EUROPE ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS:“The immediate effect of the additional duties would be very small in macroeconomic terms. The EU imported around 440,000 EVs from China in the twelve months ending in April, which were worth €9bn or around 4% of household expenditure on vehicles.“But the anti-subsidy duties are intended to limit the future growth in EV imports which would otherwise take place rather than to block existing trade.“The decision marks a big change in EU trade policy because, although the EU has used trade defence measures regularly in recent years, including against China, it has not previously done so for such an important industry. And Europe has been reluctant to engage in the kind of protectionism that the US has deployed since Donald Trump’s presidency.”MARKUS FERBER, GERMAN MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:“In imposing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, the European Commission has made the right call.“In trade policy, the EU can no longer just watch Chinese dumping practices like a deer caught in the headlights. If the European Union is serious about building up a competitive EV industry, we need to fight back.“We cannot expect European carmakers to invest massively into new capacities while they are undercut by Chinese dumping practices. We have seen this story play out once before in the solar industry and it did not have a happy ending. We would be wise not make the same mistake twice.“Tariffs and other trade barriers are only ever the last-call option, but if the competition is not playing fair, there is no other way. This is not an act of protectionism, but rather a measure that levels the playing field.”","June 12, 2024 - 16:47"
99,Private Credit Funds Take On Wall Street’s Least Loved Label,"(Bloomberg) — One of the most beleaguered financial labels on Wall Street has quietly been making inroads in the private credit market.ESG — regularly derided as “woke” and anti-capitalist in the US — is finding a foothold away from public scrutiny. Of the $156 billion raised by private credit funds last year, about 16% went into products claiming to target environmental, social and governance goals, according to data provided to Bloomberg by Preqin. That’s a bigger share than for any year since at least 2014, with figures through June this year indicating the trend is set to continue. The development coincides with dwindling access to loans for green businesses that aren’t new enough to appeal to venture capitalists, or big enough to lure infrastructure investors. That’s opened the door to private credit managers willing to build funds on loans to that middle segment.Money managers seeing an opportunity include Lombard Odier Investment Managers. The Swiss firm has zeroed in on smaller green loans to mid-sized firms, in order to then package them into portfolios for institutional investors. Lombard Odier’s flagship Sustainable Private Credit Fund, launched in July 2022 with an anchor commitment from the UK Environment Agency Pension Fund, is targeting up to $500 million in managed assets with a net annual return of about 12%.“We prefer to step back from some of the more acrimonious debates and serve markets where value is being created,” Rhys Marsh, a portfolio manager at Lombard Odier, said in an interview. “The scale of the opportunity set ahead of us is enormous.”The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 and the US regional banking crisis that ensued added to the hurdles that small green businesses face when they try to access financing. That’s as renewable-energy stocks suffer continued declines, with the S&P Global Clean Energy Index down more than 30% since the beginning of 2023. In the same period, the S&P 500 has gained about 45%.Private credit funds address a market that’s “fragmented, distributed, and currently inefficiently financed,” said Peter Pulkkinen, who oversees Lombard Odier’s Sustainable Private Credit Fund with Marsh. “There’s a tremendous amount of capital that’s looking to write $100 million-plus checks, but what we like to do is help industrialize those initial cohort pools of scale.”Barclays Plc is among financial firms noting that there’s currently a “missing middle” of green businesses struggling to get financing. Daniel Hanna, the bank’s global head of sustainable finance, said in April there’s now a need for “more focus” on such mid-sized deals, as Barclays’ newly assembled transition finance team looks for growth opportunities. The shift in focus comes as key planks of the green economy struggle to compete at a time of high interest rates and rising bank capital requirements. The risk is that the industries most needed to bring about the transition to clean energy are deprived of the capital they rely on to stay afloat, according to Chuka Umunna, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s head of ESG and green economy investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Helping innovative companies clear the commercial valley of death will require us to think differently about capital,” he said during a panel at the Bloomberg Sustainable Finance Forum in London in June. When it comes to climate solutions, “providers really require these smaller financial commitments to begin that delivery,” Marsh said.Real-world examples include solar developer Aspen Power Partners, he says, which raised hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and equity from JPMorgan, MUFG and Carlyle after an initial $25 million investment from Lombard Odier. A recent analysis by MSCI Inc. found that private capital funds have consistently made more money on their renewables investments than on holdings of oil and gas. Funds that exited renewables holdings in 2023 made 1.6 times their initial investment, compared with 1.2 times for oil and gas, marking an eighth consecutive year of outperformance, according to MSCI, which looked at private equity, private debt and real estate.Wall Street’s answer to the green financing gap has been to apply some of the industry’s more complex structures to enable ESG deals. These include ESG-labeled synthetic risk transfers, which are used by banks to free up capital and by investors to generate market-beating returns. Such deals grew to 11% from 6% of the market last year, according to the International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers.Pulkkinen says Lombard Odier’s private credit portfolio is positioned to capitalize on the roughly 235,000 family-owned and owner-operated businesses in the US seeking to raise capital in the non-sponsored segment of the $1.5 trillion private credit market.“It’s about velocity, turning these assets, getting them a lower cost of capital, and helping them scale,” Pulkkinen said.–With assistance from Esteban Duarte and Frances Schwartzkopff.(Adds MSCI data in 13th paragraph.)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","July 10, 2024 - 10:27"
100,Global trade: Switzerland and over 120 countries want to facilitate investment,"The representatives of the countries, including the head of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), Helene Budliger Artieda, voted in favour of the agreement on Sunday, the WTO said. The agreement after six years of discussions came as no surprise, as a number of outstanding issues still had to be resolved in recent months.The agreement should remove bureaucratic hurdles for investments in developing countries. It will boost the economy and lead to more jobs, said the Director-General of the WTO, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.The agreement would be the first of its kind on the international stage. According to estimates, the increase in investment associated with the reduction in red tape could generate social benefits of over CHF1 trillion ($1.13 trillion) a year and up to almost 1.5% economic growth.+ WTO study: greater world trade helps overcome challengesThe majority of the countries supporting the agreement are poorer states. They have to convince India in particular, which is opposed to plurilateral agreements. A quarter of the WTO members did not take part in the talks. The 13th meeting of the World Trade Organization officially begins on Monday in Abu Dhabi.Prior to Monday afternoon’s discussion in the ministerial round, the climate coalition published an initial list of measures to which its members intend to commit. Switzerland is a member of the coalition along with more than 60 other countries. In particular, they want to promote a link between trade, climate and sustainable development. They also want to support developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate change.In addition to the climate coalition, Budliger Artieda also met the 13 members of the Ottawa Group in the run-up to the week of negotiations. The group brings together actors with similar approaches to Switzerland. They all want a breakthrough on the issue of reforming the organisation.Translated from German by DeepL/ts","February 26, 2024 - 09:28"

It opens up wider market access and improves the legal framework and predictability for economic players.Virtually all Swiss exports to Chile will be exempt from customs duties. The agreement is supplemented by provisions on trade, sustainable development, financial services, SMEs and e-commerce.The agreement also guarantees protection for important Swiss geographical indications. It also covers all intellectual property rights and their application.+ China edges closer to free trade update with SwitzerlandIn a message on X (formerly Twitter), Economics Minister Guy Parmelin welcomed an agreement that will offer new opportunities and greater predictability for economic players. “An important step has been taken tonight to strengthen our cooperation between Switzerland and Chile”, he said.At the Davos World Economic Forum this week, Parmelin described the idea of an agreement between EFTA and Mercosur (a bloc of South American economies) this year as “optimistic” but not impossible. Discussions are expected to resume soon.+ Indigenous Brazilians fight against trade deal with SwitzerlandSECO points out that the free trade agreement between EFTA members and Chile, which has been in force since 2004, had a number of shortcomings compared with Switzerland’s more recent agreements. To remedy this, negotiations were launched in 2019.Chile is an important trading partner for Switzerland in Latin America. Since the free trade agreement came into force, trade in goods between the two countries has grown steadily, reaching a volume of CHF1.2 billion ($1.38 billion) in 2022. Trade in services has also grown over the years, reaching around CHF500 million in the same year.","January 20, 2024 - 12:28"
102,Analysis-How Europe can dodge a birth rate hard landing,"By Mark John, Anne Kauranen and Gergely Szakacs(Reuters) – For Emmanuel Macron, more babies are vital to maintain France’s national vigour. Italy’s Georgia Meloni has made encouraging more Italian women to give birth a top priority. But, demographers and economists say, Europe’s attempts to boost its flagging birth rate are missing the mark. They urge a rethink – including a change of tack to accept and embrace the economic realities of an ageing population.“It’s very, very difficult to increase fertility,” said Anna Matysiak who, as associate professor of labour market and family dynamics at the University of Warsaw, has observed years of under-achieving pronatalist policies across central Europe.Europe’s fertility rate has been stuck around 1.5 births per woman for the past decade. That is above the lows seen in East Asia, but far short of the 2.1 needed to maintain population levels – a rate Matysiak and other experts interviewed by Reuters see as highly unlikely to be attained in the foreseeable future.European governments are already spending billions of euros on top of basic welfare provision to fund pro-child measures ranging from outright cash incentives for children to tax breaks for larger families, paid parental leave and child benefit.But even countries such as France and the Czech Republic, which in past years have had relatively lofty fertility rates around 1.8, are now seeing those fall. Across the continent, the reaons are varied and in some cases not fully understood.DEEPER CULTURAL SHIFTSMarta Seiz, Madrid-based university professor of family sociology, demography and inequalities, said factors such as soaring housing costs and job insecurity were linked to Spain’s fertility rate, at 1.19 second lowest in Europe after Malta’s.“People would like to have children and they would like to have them earlier but they have not been able to do so for structural reasons,” she said.Such economic constraints are felt everywhere. But there is also evidence of a shift in deeper cultural attitudes towards parenthood.Norway – a wealthy country with strong family supports and job security – saw its fertility rate plummet from 2 in 2009 to 1.41, its lowest on record, by 2022.In a 2023 country review, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) suggested reasons for the fall including changing gender roles, greater focus on careers and even how social media can amplify a sense of insecurity. It concluded, however, that the slump remained a conundrum.Finnish demographer Anna Rotkirch has also observed deep cultural changes in surveys assessing a similar drop in fertility in her country, with many young adults now seeing a fundamental trade-off between parenthood and other goals.“This goes right into what is a desirable, pleasant and attractive life path, lifestyle, and broader values and ideals,” said Rotkirch, research professor and director of Finland’s Population Research Institute.“No one really knows what kind of family policy would work in this new situation to promote fertility.”UNTAPPED POTENTIALSo does this condemn Europe to the dire “demographic timebomb” scenario often evoked of ageing, ultimately shrinking societies unable to sustain pension provision, hamstrung by chronic labour shortages and with no one to care for the old?That depends on whether its economies deploy some of the levers at their disposal to adapt.Economist David Miles at Imperial College London rejects the “timebomb” warning and says falling populations can avoid lower living standards if output per capita is maintained: among other things, if they evolve to work more and better.“There is a deep flaw in the logic that there is something magical about 65 as the age when work stops,” said Miles, who argued that greater life expectancies and lower prevalence of strenuous work in Europe’s services-dominated economies made it possible for people to remain in labour markets for longer.Moves to raise retirement ages remain politically toxic – witness the protests against Macron’s reforms last year. But the age at which workers in advanced economies leave the labour market has been rising slowly but steadily since around 2000.Increasing women’s access to work could yield even more benefits. The proportion of European women in the labour market stands at around 69% – 11% lower than for men – meaning the untapped potential is high.“A lot of additional economic resources can be drawn from that,” noted Willem Adema, senior economist in the OECD Social Policy Division, citing teleworking and other flexible arrangements as ways of helping more women into work.Europe can also import more labour: beyond the noisy anti-immigrant rhetoric, it already relies on some 10 million non-EU workers. While migrants’ parental choices and welfare profile ultimately mirror those of the wider population, they have proven vital in addressing specific labour shortages.And while predictions of the economic boost likely from automation and artificial intelligence can be taken with a pinch of salt, they at least offer the scope to enhance productivity.Finland’s Rotkirch emphasised there was a still a need for family policy to support the decisions of would-be parents but called for a much wider debate on how to address low fertility, which she said traditional family policies alone would not fix.“You see the long term trends,” said Adema. “If people don’t want to have children, there’s no point forcing them.”","February 14, 2024 - 16:03"
103,Rate Chokehold on World Economy Is Set to Loosen Only Slowly,"(Bloomberg) — The high tide for global interest rates has passed, but respite for the world economy may be limited as policymakers stay wary at the threat of inflation.That’s the dominant theme this year prevailing across 23 major central banks tracked by Bloomberg. All but three are seen set to reduce borrowing costs — but the pace of easing for many of them looks ever less likely to mirror the aggressive speed at which tightening first took hold. Even if renewed US inflation concerns prove unfounded enough that the Federal Reserve can begin steady rate cutting, the grip of monetary policy on the world won’t get markedly looser, according to Bloomberg Economics.Its aggregate measure of borrowing costs across advanced economies is set to fall less than 100 basis points by the end of 2024. That’s not as much as it rose last year, and just a fraction of the 435 basis-point increase seen since mid-2021. And the lag in transmission means easing effects will take more time to feed through. Such a policy path reflects how central bankers are treading a fine line between aiding anemic economies and guarding against a resurgence in consumer-price growth, potentially aggravated by another energy shock. A cloudier outlook for the Fed and the shadow of US presidential elections won’t help either. Geopolitical tension, with conflict between Israel and Iran threatening conflagration in the Middle East, is an additional risk variable.“Premature easing could see new inflation surprises that may even necessitate a further bout of monetary tightening,” International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said in a speech last Thursday heralding her institution’s meetings in Washington this week. “On the other side, delaying too long could pour cold water on economic activity.”Policy may remain constricted in South Africa and Argentina and even tighter in crisis-ridden Nigeria, while Japan is poised to continue its exit from ultra-loose settings. But for most of the world, rate-cutting cycles poised either to begin or advance may offer only mild relief to consumers and businesses.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“2024 was shaping up to be a year of slumping growth, steadying prices, and early and aggressive rate cuts. Now, it’s looking more like a year of resilient growth, persistent price pressure, and policy normalization that starts later and proceeds at a more measured pace. For the financial markets, shifting expectations on the Fed, ECB and BOE, as well as a wild card as the BOJ wriggles free of its stimulus straitjacket, add up to a period of pivot peril.” —Tom Orlik, global chief economistHere is Bloomberg’s quarterly guide to the outlook for the world’s top central banks, which set rate policy for a combined 90% of the global economy.GROUP OF SEVENUS Federal ReserveFed officials will be watching for signs in the second quarter that inflation is still headed firmly toward their 2% target rate.After easing rapidly last year, price pressures have picked back up in 2024. That’s raised concerns about the inflation outlook and whether the figures are a mere blip — as Fed officials have long warned — or a more concerning sign that progress has stalled.Recent consumer price data suggested the latter, with a key gauge of underlying inflation topping economists’ expectations for a third-straight month in March. Investors now bet the US central bank will cut just twice this year, starting in September, according to futures markets as of April 11.Much rests on the next few months of data — from the timing of the first rate cut to the total number of cuts this year. Most officials currently see two or three rate reductions in 2024, but an extended pause in inflation progress or an unexpected weakening in the labor market could very well alter the picture.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“With inflation prints surprising on the high side in 1Q 24, we have pushed back our expectation for the first Fed rate cut to July. But we still expect a total of 100-bps cuts in 2024, more than 75-bps that the median Fed official projected in the latest summary of economic projections, and more than the two-cuts markets now priced for. That’s because we see unemployment rising incrementally in the rest of the year, reaching 4.7% by end-year. The Fed is beholden to its dual mandate, and will have to cut even as inflation is fluctuating around 3%.”—Anna WongEuropean Central BankThe ECB is on track to cut rates at its next meeting in June after President Christine Lagarde laid firmer groundwork for such a move at last week’s press conference. That would seal the euro zone’s status as the first of the world’s major economic jurisdictions to start easing. Some officials want the ECB to keep going after that, but Lagarde refuses to be drawn on any potential further steps.With investors doubting the Fed’s appetite to cut anytime soon, the ECB could find itself going it alone. While that would burnish a willingness not to follow the US lead, it also risks casting light on any difference that might emerge in the cost of borrowing on either side of the Atlantic. Inflation threats posed by possible euro weakening that could result, or a potential surge in the oil price, might yet brake the ECB’s efforts to reduce constriction on a tepid economy.Lagarde insisted last week that her central bank is “not Fed dependent.” But she did acknowledge that the US is a “very sizable economy” and that any implications from there will feed its way into staff forecasts produced for the June 6 decision.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The ECB is preparing to lower rates. Headline inflation and measures of underlying price increases are rapidly decelerating, and wage growth is slowing. However, the Governing Council is still waiting for data from 1Q24 to confirm that inflation is on the right trajectory and cost pressures continue to abate. Our view is the ECB will cut by 25 bps in June, and, after a pause in July, by the same amount in September, October and December.”—David PowellBank of JapanThe key question for the Bank of Japan is how fast it will continue normalizing policy after scrapping the world’s last negative interest rate and calling time on its massive monetary easing program in March. Market players are keen for clarity on the timing of its next rate hike and the specifics of how it will unwind its gigantic balance sheet. The pace will depend on the central bank’s confidence in a stable inflation path, with new quarterly economic projections in April likely to offer an important signal.Most BOJ watchers expect the next rate hike by October with many of them warning of a possible earlier move with the feeble yen hovering around a 34-year low. If the government intervenes to try and stem the tide of currency weakness without success, the spotlight could quickly fall on Governor Kazuo Ueda to help out. Still, raising rates quickly would be a tough decision when the economy is still sputtering.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The BOJ will move to secure a rate buffer in case inflation loses steam because resurrection of the unconventional policy is the last thing it wants. The core CPI inflation expected to register above 2% for a while — helped by lower base reflecting last year’s energy subsidies — will provide good optics for tightening. We see the BOJ raise its rate target from a 0%-0.1% range now to 0.15%-0.25% in July, followed by another hike to 0.4%-0.5% in October.”—Taro KimuraBank of EnglandBy the June decision, the Bank of England could be given confidence to cut by data that is likely to show headline inflation sinking below its 2% target, and the impact of wage settlements for the crucial month of April.Governor Andrew Bailey has been guarded on the exact timing of a reduction but recently said the UK is “on the way” to cutting rates after a shift in tone from the central bank’s rate-setters. While the next meeting in May, which includes a new round of forecasts, is seen as too soon for a pivot, the Monetary Policy Committee could use the decision to signal an imminent shift is ahead.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“With headline inflation on course to fall below 2% in coming months, the Bank of England is likely to start easing in the summer. We think the first move down will be in June, with cuts at each meeting until the end of 2024. That would mean rates end the year at 4%. Slower cuts are likely in 2025 as the central bank feels its way toward neutral.”—Dan Hanson Bank of CanadaThe Bank of Canada’s governing council is actively debating when it can start to lower the benchmark from 5% after getting better-than-expected inflation prints to start the year. Still, economic growth is running hotter, and officials said they need to see more evidence to be confident price pressures are sustainably returning to the 2% target.In a press conference after the April decision, Governor Tiff Macklem told reporters a June cut was “within the realm of possibilities.” Economists expect policymakers to ease monetary policy at that meeting, and the two inflation prints leading up to the decision are crucial guideposts in determining how much earlier the central bank will end up frontrunning the Fed.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“A looming slowdown in economic activity sets the stage for a pivot this summer — we think in July. Though odds of swifter cuts increased as inflation surprised to the downside, the BoC is likely unconvinced that underlying inflation pressures have been fully tamed. Resilient demand and home price pressures — downstream of population growth and immigration — increase the odds of a secondary surge in inflation if monetary policy becomes accommodative too quickly.”—Stuart PaulBRICS CENTRAL BANKSPeople’s Bank of ChinaChina’s first quarter growth might beat estimates, according to strong early data. But the PBOC is expected to stick to its easing path, given weak inflation, a sinking property market, and the relatively ambitious GDP growth target of around 5% for this year.Worries about a weakening currency are weighing on Beijing’s mind, limiting the chance of bold reductions to key landing rates before any Fed decision on easing. A cut to bank reserve requirements is likely to come first, with several economists expecting a 25-50bp reduction in the second quarter. The PBOC is seen as likely to step up lending to policy banks to support housing and infrastructure projects. While excitement about new QE-like monetary tools is growing, such innovations appear to be a way off yet.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“We expect the PBOC to lower its one-year policy rate by 10 basis points to 2.40% in 2Q and deliver two more cuts of similar magnitude by the end of the year. Policymakers need to fight deflation in producer prices and downward pressure on consumer prices. Cushioning the housing correction also requires more stimulus. A constraint on the PBOC has been the weak yuan. The prospect of Fed easing in 2Q should make it easier for the PBOC to move.”—David QuReserve Bank of IndiaThe Reserve Bank of India kept benchmark rate unchanged at 6.5% for the seventh straight review in April, while Governor Shaktikanta Das’s hawkish tones dashed hopes of an early cut.“We derive satisfaction from the progress made under disinflation, but the task is not yet finished,” Das said in his interaction with the media after the policy, vowing to maintain an unwavering focus on lowering the inflation near its target 4%. Inflation in March moderated for three straight months, but the print is still nearly a percentage point away from the target. Maintaining lower inflation is critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a rare third term in elections starting next week.Forecasts of high temperatures in April, May and June that could damage crops and push up food prices have also complicated the inflation management task for the central bank. For now, the RBI will watch out for the impact of an uncertain weather, and also wait to see the full transmission of its past 250 basis points rate increases getting fully transmitted through banking channels.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“We see the RBI delaying its easing cycle to August for three reasons. It has a false sense of comfort from a spurt in 4Q23 GDP growth that had a shaky foundation, it wants to see inflation dropping further to target, and it wants to follow, not pre-empt a Fed rate cut. The unwarranted hawkish bias now is likely to give way to deeper cuts later. We expect a total of 150 bps of cuts by 3Q25, taking the repo rate to 5.0%.”—Abhishek GuptaCentral Bank of BrazilBrazil’s central bank has signaled one more rate cut of 50 basis points at its next decision in May and opened the door to smaller reductions thereafter. Policymakers led by Roberto Campos Neto say heightened uncertainty forced them to change forward guidance that had previously indicated an easing path for two meetings ahead.While annual inflation slowed more than expected in March, services costs remain elevated, prompting concerns about pressures from a tight labor market. Waning economic activity has pushed President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s government to increase spending, possibly leading to a more gradual consumer price slowdown toward target.Doubts about the central bank’s tolerance for inflation once Lula appoints a new governor later this year have also kept investors’ consumer price estimates above the 3% target for months.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“We expect the BCB to halve its rate-cut pace to 25 basis points per meeting in June, and extend it through year end. Concerns about global inflation, slower monetary easing in advanced economies and a tight labor market at home warrant a more cautious pace. Unanchored long-term inflation expectations may impede the process. Our 9% year-end Selic forecast implies a 5.5% ex-ante real rate — between neutral and slightly contractionary monetary policy.”—Adriana DupitaBank of RussiaAfter holding its key rate at 16% throughout the first quarter, the Bank of Russia signaled “a long period” of tight monetary conditions this year as it highlighted uncertainty over the economy amid persistent high inflation and worsening foreign trade due to sanctions over the war in Ukraine.At their March 22 meeting, policymakers noted “proinflationary surprises” in data on a tightening labor market and consumer spending and lending that meant the risks underlying inflation would remain high “or go up are significant.”Vladimir Putin’s inauguration in May for a fifth term as president may be followed by a government shake-up that could impact policy as the state continues to spend heavily on the war including defense production.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“With rates at 16%, the Bank of Russia runs the region’s tightest policy. Despite this, enterprise and household surveys are yet to show signs of cooling activity. The central bank’s likely to start cutting in June as reports confirm inflation’s on track to reach the 4% SAAR target in 4Q24. Still, the current easing cycle will be slow as policymakers would want to avoid hurting the currency with premature cuts.”—Alexander IsakovSouth African Reserve BankSouth Africa’s central bank is set to maintain its key rate at a 15-year high this quarter as risks to its inflation outlook remain from higher oil prices, drought conditions and a resurgent dollar even as election uncertainty prevails. Governor Lesetja Kganyago and two of his deputies’ terms were extended for another five years last month assuring policy continuity as the country prepares for elections on May 29 that could reshape its political landscape.Opinion polls show that the ruling African National Congress may lose its majority for the first time since coming to power in 1994. “We deal with uncertainty all the time, elections are just one uncertainty we have to deal with,” Kganyago said recently. “We will still make decisions the same way.”The central bank prefers to peg inflation expectations at the midpoint of its 3% to 6% target range. Kganyago has repeatedly said it will only lower rates once inflation retreats to the 4.5% midpoint and is sustained there.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Resilient price pressures will keep the SARB from cutting rates this year. Reducing inflation to the mid-point of the central bank’s 3%-6% target is taking longer than anticipated. We foresee dry conditions having only modest effects on the cost of food. Fuel prices will likely tick up in the second quarter. The president’s reappointment of Kganyago to another five years as governor of the SARB, signals continuity in a year laden with political uncertainty.”—Yvonne MhangoMINT CENTRAL BANKSBanco de MexicoMexico’s central bank, known as Banxico, has promised that any further rate cuts after its initial reduction in March will be gradual. Latin America’s second-largest economy has had robust domestic demand and sticky core inflation that has left some policymakers worried.The bank has not ruled out further easing in coming meetings, with Governor Victoria Rodriguez saying they would have to decide “step-by-step.” Still, the five board members could remain split over the proper way to proceed. The one dissenting member in the last decision, in which the bank lowered the key rate to 11%, said she thought reductions were premature.Mexico’s inflation is expected to nearly reach the 3% target by the second quarter of 2025.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Banxico cut rates to 11% in March, the firist such move since the end of the tightening cycle one year earlier. Decelerating inflation and lower expectations provide room for some more accommodation, but they are poised to remain above the target and limit the downside. Slower growth consistent with a narrowing positive output gap also supports a gradual adjustment. US rates are a constraint. We see Banxico slowly cutting rates, but monetary conditions still tight in 2024.”—Felipe HernandezBank IndonesiaRupiah weakness will be top of mind for Bank Indonesia this quarter as the incoming government brings with it fresh fiscal risks that spurred heavy bond outflows. President-elect Prabowo Subianto’s signature campaign pledge of free lunches for 80 million school children is expected to cost about 2% of GDP and has elicited warnings from credit raters.Alongside a widening current-account deficit, declining foreign exchange reserves and stubbornly high food prices, Bank Indonesia will unlikely be in a rush to lower its policy rate until the second half of this year once there’s greater clarity about the Fed’s own easing path. It may look to lower reserve requirements, though, as a way to support bank lending in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Bank Indonesia is likely to cut rates by 75 bps in 2024, but it won’t move until after the Fed starts easing. Jumping the gun would narrow the rate differential – undercutting the rupiah, which it’s worked hard to prop up. Capital inflows are also vulnerable to a reversal if the global slowdown cools risk appetite. Another hurdle is inflation. BI is wary of a breach of its new inflation target. This likely keeps BI rates on hold in 1H24.”—Tamara HendersonCentral Bank of TurkeyTurkey’s central bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate tight throughout the second quarter, with expectations that inflation will begin to slow as of June, after peaking above 70% in the coming months.Policymakers have said the rates could be tightened further should the inflation outlook deteriorate. The central bank is likely to focus on sidesteps to cool demand and curb credit growth while trying to encourage savings in Turkish lira during this period. Risks to the inflation outlook include any potential interim hike to the minimum wage and the central bank has urged the to government to refrain from such a step. What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The CBRT’s cumulative 4150-bps of rate hikes since May 2023 may not be the end of its restrictive steps. The central bank will likely deliver additional tightening ahead via its rate corridor and alternative tools such as reserve requirements. An outsized hike to the government’s tax and fee schedule, or a mid-year lift in the minimum wage could see the central bank deliver further hikes, or delay cuts.”—Selva Bahar BazikiCentral Bank of NigeriaHaving delivered a combined 600 basis-point increase in the first quarter of the year, the risk of another rate hike in Nigeria has reduced. Its willingness to act has stabilized the naira, closed the gap with the parallel market rate and led to the return of foreign investors. Key to what it does next will be the impact on inflation of a recent threefold increase in electricity tariffs that will affect millions of residents and businesses in the urban areas and talks of a new minimum wage in May. The inflation rate has been at more than triple the top end of the central bank’s 6% to 9% target range since October.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Nigeria is nearing the end of its hiking cycle, helped by an appreciating naira. A threefold increase in electricity tariffs in April will place upward pressure on inflation this quarter. We expect two more rate hikes this year, taking the policy rate to around 28% by mid-2024. Inflation is likely to start a very slow turn, thereafter, closing out 2024 around 30%. Persistent price pressures will keep rates elevated over the next couple of years.”—Yvonne MhangoOTHER G-20 CENTRAL BANKSBank of KoreaBank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong set the scene for a potential policy pivot later this year as the board decided to keep the benchmark rate on hold for a 10th consecutive time on Friday. Revealing that no one in the board is ruling out the possibility of a rate cut if inflation decelerates to 2.3% in the second half as expected, Rhee said May will be an important month for the bank because that’s when key economic and inflation data are due.The change in his tone comes after in February he pushed back against speculation for an early policy pivot and sought to keep the focus on fighting inflation. While reiterating the bank prioritized helping to rein in prices, Rhee said the bank now wanted to create room for an eventual policy change. In a policy statement after the decision, the bank indeed removed “long” from its previous pledge to keep the rate restrictive “for sufficiently long.”What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Bank of Korea isn’t ready to shift away from its restrictive stance yet. Inflation is trending downward but the final stretch to its 2% target will be bumpy and uncertain – arguing for more patience. One thing is clear — its next move will be a cut, probably in August. Weakening domestic demand and stability risks from a highly leveraged property sector will call for more accommodation once its inflation goal looks secure.”—Hyosung KwonReserve Bank of AustraliaThe RBA has signaled it’s probably concluded an 18-month policy tightening campaign after taking borrowing costs to a 12-year high in an effort to quell inflation. Most economists expect the RBA’s next move will be down, with an easing cycle expected to begin in earnest in the second half of the year.Governor Michele Bullock has repeatedly highlighted that the rate path is uncertain. Just last month, she said the board can’t rule “anything in or out,” indicating that she isn’t yet ready to pivot to an easing stance, unlike counterparts in other developed markets. Australia’s central bank meets next on May 6-7 and by then will have seen a key inflation reading for the first three months of 2024.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBA has done more than enough to ensure inflation returns to its 2%-3% target bans in a reasonable timeframe. The central bank is likely to pivot to policy easing in 2024. We expect the data will reveal a further slowdown in growth as rapid passthrough of rate hikes thus far hit consumer spending hard through 1H24. Swift policy passthrough means the RBA has less room to hold rates at their peak before policy needs to pivot to supporting growth.”—James McIntyreCentral Bank of ArgentinaAnnual inflation under President Javier Milei is running at a three-decade-high of 276%. Still, month-on-month price rises are dwindling, and Economy Minister Luis Caputo has said March’s reading will come in at 10%. That’s down from 26% in December, when Milei lifted price controls and devalued the currency.Central Bank Chief Santiago Bausili has cut the benchmark rate from 133% to 80% since taking office in an aim to reduce interest payments on peso notes. Lower March inflation projections have fueled speculation of another reduction. However, the International Monetary Fund, which Argentina owes $44 billion, has laid out the expectation for rates to exceed inflation in order to encourage savings in pesos.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The BCRA has relied on negative real rates to erode the value of its interest-bearing liabilities –a move only possible due to currency controls. Once those are eased or lifted, real rates will have to be positive. That can be done without raising the nominal rate if inflation expectations continue to fall – which depends crucially on a sustainable fiscal adjustment.”—Adriana DupitaG-10 CURRENCIES AND EAST EUROPE ECONOMIESSwiss National BankThe Swiss National Bank surprised investors last month by delivering the first rate cut yet seen this cycle from one of the world’s 10 most-traded currency jurisdictions. Unexpectedly slow inflation data since then has so far vindicated that decision by policymakers including departing President Thomas Jordan. Economists expect a slight acceleration in consumer-price growth over the coming months due to trickling down rent increases. But with inflation now at just 1%, that’s unlikely to pose much of a worry. Two more cuts this year look probable. What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The SNB in March surprised markets by cutting its policy rate, moving ahead of the ECB and the Fed. Concerns over stoking upside risks on the currency, as major central banks gear up for their first moves, likely played a key role in this decision. With inflation due to stay comfortably below the SNB’s 2% upper bound, we expect the central bank to cut its rate again twice more, to 1%, by year-end.”—Maeva CousinSveriges RiksbankThe world’s oldest central bank has charted a path to easing that indicates it could announce a rate cut either May 8 or June 23, though a sharp depreciation of the Swedish krona that started in mid-March illustrates that currency moves remain a risk for Governor Erik Thedeen and his colleagues. Any further krona weakening that threatens to fuel import prices would lower policymakers appetite for moving ahead of the ECB’s expected reduction in June.Either way, the Riksbank has signaled that it plans to loosen monetary conditions at a modest pace after the initial move, allowing them to take stock of the impact of rate cuts before continuing to ease. The bank’s current guidance indicates that its benchmark rate may be cut by 75 basis points, to 3.25%, by the end of this year.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Riksbank surprised in March with a dovish message on a likely rate cut in May or June. We think the probable hit to the already weak krona from a kick off to the easing cycle far in advance of other major central banks – the ECB in June and the Fed in July, in our view – make the latter date more probable.”—Selva Bahar BazikiNorges BankNorway’s central bank is set to begin lowering borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 4.5% in the autumn, most likely in September, according to its latest outlook. Underlying inflation slowed last month more than forecast, countering recent signs of resilience to high credit costs in the energy-rich economy and suggesting the policymakers may not need to delay monetary easing to the end of the year.Governor Ida Wolden Bache and other rate-setters have cited uncertainty on krone moves as another crucial factor that speaks in favor of a cautious stance. A wage deal between industrial unions and employers last weekend also signaled heightened risks for cost inflation as it secured somewhat bigger pay increases than expected. The central bank doesn’t expect to reach its 2%-target on inflation on an average annual basis even by 2027, according to its latest economic projections last month.Reserve Bank of New ZealandThe RBNZ is talking tough, saying it won’t cut rates until 2025 in order to be sure that inflation, currently running at 4.7%, returns to its 2% target. Price pressures have been more persistent than policymakers would like as surging immigration swells the population and boosts costs such as rents. But with the economy in recession and expected to stay weak for much of this year, investors and most economists are picking a pivot to monetary easing sometime in the next six months. The RBNZ’s chief economist has also acknowledged that if the Fed cutsfirst, that may hasten New Zealand easing by driving up the exchange rate and damping imported inflation.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBNZ’s hawkish stance is unrealistic, and won’t last long. The full effects of 525 basis points of tightening since October 2021 are being felt, with the economy contracting, unemployment rising and inflation cooling. Bloomberg Economics expects the boost from strong migration will fade fast in early 2024, and a shift in economic reality will drive a policy pivot. Rate cuts are likely to arrive sooner than anticipated, in the mid- to late-24, as the focus switches from fighting inflation to reviving demand.”—James McIntyreNational Bank of PolandPoland’s central bank will likely hold off from cutting rates this year as policy makers expect inflation to flare up again as the government restores higher taxes on food and energy.The administration of Prime Minister Donald Tusk is phasing out measures that the previous cabinet imposed in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to curb surging prices. Inflation is now back within the central bank’s target for the first time in three years after peaking at 18.4% in February last year. For Governor Adam Glapinski the outlook may worsen as government measures kick in and wages continue to grow rapidly. But he may have bigger concerns, too. The ruling coalition is planning to start a parliamentary probe after accusing Glapinski of political meddling before last year’s election and other irregularities. The governor has denied any wrong doing.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Poland is likely to hold the reference rate at 5.75% until June and cut to 5.25% by end 2024. The timing of the cuts will depend on core inflation and the strength of the economic recovery. The recent downside surprises in inflation will likely nudge policymakers toward a more dovish stance. One major risk stems from the growing frictions between the government and the central bank’s governor Adam Glapinski, which could spook markets.”—Alexander IsakovCzech National BankThe Czechs have accelerated policy easing this year, delivering half-point cuts in February and March, as inflation hit the 2% target sooner than expected. The central bank signaled it will keep lowering borrowing costs, but less than implied in its forecast that sees the end-year level at 2.6%Governor Ales Michl has warned that risks including rising costs for services and a weaker exchange rate could slow or halt rate cuts if they threaten to push inflation higher again. “That’s why the bank board believes it’s necessary to maintain a restrictive monetary policy and to keep approaching further rate cuts with caution,” he said after the March meeting. –With assistance from Beril Akman, Maya Averbuch, Bastian Benrath, Matthew Brockett, Maria Eloisa Capurro, Alice Gledhill, Tony Halpin, Tom Hancock, Erik Hertzberg, James Hirai, Claire Jiao, Scott Johnson (Economist), Sam Kim, Peter Laca, Matthew Malinowski, Nduka Orjinmo, Swati Pandey, Reade Pickert, Tom Rees, Niclas Rolander, Piotr Skolimowski, Ntando Thukwana, Manuela Tobias, Ott Ummelas and Monique Vanek.(Updates Fed, ECB market pricing)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","April 15, 2024 - 10:50"
104,UBS Ditches Credit Suisse Plan to Phase Out Coal Financing,"(Bloomberg) — UBS Group AG is set to scrap a planned phaseout of coal financing that Credit Suisse had backed, as the global wealth manager prepares to unveil how the merged bank will tackle climate change.After months of internal debate on how to treat Credit Suisse’s climate strategy, UBS executives now intend to stick with their own policy on coal funding meaning the bank will have no end date for financing the dirtiest fossil fuel, people familiar with the matter said. The example is just one in a list of climate finance decisions due to be made public later this month, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing private details. UBS will also retire a string of Credit Suisse green targets, even if that means the combined Swiss bank will have no stance in the areas for which policies have been scratched, the people said.Given the complexity of merging two separate sustainability strategies, UBS’ position on coal could still change once the integration is complete, one of the people said.The historic rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS in March 2023 represents the first major bank merger of the net zero era, as climate change forces the sector to grapple with a new layer of risk. And though UBS is primarily focused on serving the ultra-wealthy rather than on traditional lending, it has “one of the weakest fossil fuel policies in Europe,” according to Jeanne Martin, head of the banking program at climate nonprofit ShareAction. A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment on the details of its planned update on coal. In general, however, the bank’s “ambition remains unchanged; to be a global leader in sustainability.” “We have a clear plan, which received the full support of our shareholders at our annual general meeting in 2023,” the spokesperson said. “As part of the integration of Credit Suisse, we have undertaken an extensive review of the decarbonization goals considering the profile of the combined organization and inherited client relationships and activities. Our upcoming Sustainability Report will contain details about our climate approach as well as an overview of decarbonization targets for the combined bank.”UBS’s existing policy allows the bank to finance coal-fired power companies and miners, as long as production isn’t being expanded and no more than a fifth of revenue comes from coal. Credit Suisse had a coal revenue threshold for lending, as well as for capital markets underwriting for coal extraction and power generation. It had pledged to reduce the threshold from 25% in 2020, to 15% in 2025 and 5% in 2030, by which time it aimed to have no remaining credit exposure to thermal coal. UBS has said it will reduce the absolute financed emissions associated with loans to fossil fuel companies by 71% by 2030. Credit Suisse had planned a 49% reduction in absolute financed oil, gas and coal emissions in the same time period. UBS ranks above some of its peers on broad sustainability metrics: Nonprofit CDP gives it an A- score, which recognizes “environmental leadership.” The bank was a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance, in which lenders commit to eliminate financed emissions by 2050 or sooner, and its asset management unit is a signatory of a related group for money managers.Global banks are increasingly moderating some of the more ambitious climate targets that would be required to align the finance sector with net zero emissions. HSBC Holdings Plc published an updated climate policy in January that gave it greater flexibility to keep coal clients on its books. Following the government-backed takeover of Credit Suisse last year, UBS Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti has set about bringing over the businesses that fit with the larger bank’s overall strategy and jettisoning those that don’t. Chairman Colm Kelleher has warned that 2024 will be a critical year for the integration, as many of the more straightforward cost and job cuts have already been made. Sector TargetsAnother key difference between the former Zurich rivals is the sectors they’ve targeted for emissions cuts. Both banks set interim targets for the most carbon-intensive areas of their balance sheets. Credit Suisse had seven targets for its loan book, from commercial real estate to power generation, while UBS had five covering cement to fossil fuels.As the integration process has progressed, UBS has emerged with a clearer picture of where the emissions lie, the people said. As such, decarbonization targets for two Credit Suisse portfolios — autos and aluminum — have been paused while the bank reassesses the materiality of its exposures in those sectors, one of the people said.In several other areas, UBS has been more definitive with its cuts, even going as far as to scrap initiatives for which it doesn’t have anything comparable of its own.One prominent example is Credit Suisse’s Client Energy Transition Framework, which assesses the transition strategies of customers in the most carbon-intensive sectors, including oil and gas companies and airlines, and ranks them on their level of ambitions and preparedness. Even though UBS did not have an equivalent client transition assessment system of its own, the CETF was retired at the end of last year and the bank is now working on developing its own version. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse’s pledge to provide 300 billion Swiss francs ($340 billion) of sustainable finance by 2030 has also been retired. UBS has no equivalent commitment for its loan book, though it has said that it plans to allocate $400 billion in sustainable investments by 2025.UBS’s “targets and reporting around emissions fail to cover the bulk of the financing it provides to the fossil fuel companies that are accelerating the climate crisis,” ShareAction’s Martin said. “For UBS’s new sustainability strategy to be credible, it must address these gaping loopholes and scale up its ambition.”–With assistance from Myriam Balezou.(Updates with context on global bank climate targets)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","March 19, 2024 - 12:38"
105,Putin’s address to Russia’s parliament,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual state-of-the-nation address on Thursday to Russia’s elite, updating them on the war in Ukraine, Moscow’s nuclear capabilities, the Russian economy and relations with the West.The speech comes two weeks ahead of a presidential election in which Putin is expected to win another six-year term in a landslide.Here are highlights from his speech, which was delivered to members of both houses of parliament, state officials, military commanders and soldiers.WAR IN UKRAINE“Today, when our homeland is defending its sovereignty and security and protecting the lives of our fellow countrymen in Donbas and Novorossiya (regions of Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed), the decisive role in this righteous struggle belongs to our citizens, our unity, devotion to our native country and responsibility for its fate…“We did not start this war in Donbas. As I have said many times, we will do everything to end it, to eradicate Nazism. To fulfill all the tasks of the special military operation. To protect the sovereignty and security of our citizens.”“The combat capabilities of the armed forces have increased multifold. Our units firmly hold the initiative (in Ukraine). They are confidently advancing in a number of operational directions, liberating new territories.”DIALOGUE WITH WASHINGTON“Russia is ready for dialogue with the United States of America on issues of strategic stability.”“There have been more and more unsubstantiated accusations against Russia, for example that we are allegedly going to deploy nuclear weapons in space. Such innuendo, which is nothing but innuendo, is a ploy to draw us into negotiations on their terms, which are favourable only to the United States.”“The words of today’s American authorities about their alleged interest in negotiations with us on strategic stability issues are demagoguery… they simply want to show their citizens and everyone else that they still rule the world.”NATO TROOPS TO UKRAINE, RUSSIAN WESTWARD BUILDUP“The West provoked the conflict in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in other regions of the world, and continues to lie, without any embarrassment, saying that Russia allegedly intends to attack Europe.”“There has been talk about the possibility of sending NATO military contingents to Ukraine … the consequences for possible interventionists will be … tragic.”“We also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilisation. Don’t they get that?”“It is seriously necessary to strengthen the groupings (of troops) in the western strategic direction to neutralise the threats associated with the next expansion of NATO to the east: taking Sweden and Finland into the alliance.”MISSILES, NUKES, ARMS RACE“Strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness for guaranteed use.”“The hypersonic dagger aircraft system has not only been put into service, but is also being used with high efficiency to hit particularly important targets in the course of the special military operation.”“The hypersonic sea-based complex Zircon has also already been used in battle. The hypersonic units of the intercontinental range Avangard (and) the laser systems Peresvet are on combat duty. The tests of the Burevestnik unlimited-range cruise missile are being finalised. And the unmanned underwater vehicle Poseidon… The first mass-produced Sarmat heavy ballistic missiles have been delivered to the troops.”“The West is trying to drag us into an arms race. They are trying to wear us down, to repeat the trick they succeeded (in pulling off) with the Soviet Union in the 1980s.“Therefore, our task is to develop the defence-industrial complex … (and) the scientific, technological and industrial potential of the country.”RUSSIA’S SYSTEM AND THE WEST“Russia’s political system is one of the pillars of the country’s sovereignty… We will not allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs.”“The so-called West, with its colonial behaviour and habit of fomenting national conflicts around the world, seeks not just to hold back our development – instead of Russia, they want a dependent, declining, dying place where they can do whatever they want.”RUSSIA’S ECONOMY“Last year Russia’s economy grew at a rate higher than the world economy… Today, Russia is the largest economy in Europe in terms of gross domestic product in terms of purchasing power parity, and the fifth largest in the world.“Today, the share of non-resource industries in the growth structure safely exceeds 90% … the economy is becoming more complex, more technological and therefore much more sustainable.”POVERTY AND SOCIAL SUPPORT“The problem of poverty is still acute, it now directly affects more than 9% of the population. And among large families…the poverty rate is more than 30%.“We need constant work to improve quality of life of families with children (and) support the birth rate. For this purpose, we will launch a new national project called ‘Family’.“I propose additional help to subjects of the Federation where the birth rate is below the national average… By the end of 2030 we will allocate at least 75 billion roubles ($825.56 million) to such regions.”($1 = 90.8475 roubles)(Reporting by ReutersCompiled by Lucy PapachristouEditing by Gareth Jones, John Davison)","February 29, 2024 - 14:02"
106,‘I hope the voluntary carbon offset market will come to an end’,"SWI swissinfo.ch: I recently flew from Seville to Geneva and offset the carbon emissions by funding a reforestation project in Nicaragua
External link
. Can the emissions from a flight be balanced out by planting trees? Or is this marketing for passengers who want to clear their conscience?Carsten Warnecke: It is not possible at all to offset emissions in this way. The production of jet fuel disrupts the long-term carbon cycle, which stored the carbon underground for millennia. Planting trees, on the other hand, means storing carbon in the short term.No one can guarantee that the tree I plant today to compensate for my flight will still be there in 20 or 30 years. Climate change itself is a threat to forests, as shown by increasingly frequent wildfires, droughts and pests. It is already a big challenge to preserve existing forests. And the potential for biological carbon storage is limited: nature would at best allow us to compensate for historical emissions or emissions that we now consider unavoidable. So-called nature-based solutions are not suitable or available at a scale that we can use them to compensate for today’s emissions.We do not need nice pictures of green trees and projects that give us the impression that we do not have to change our behaviour. We need drastic images, like those on cigarette packets, which show the real impact of our actions.SWI: Offsetting organisations and companies offer numerous international environmental projects, from recycling plastic in Romania to installing energy-efficient stoves in Kenya. Consumers can support these voluntarily. How can they choose the project with the greatest impact?C.W.: Even for those who are well informed, it is impossible to select the most effective projects. Some projects are presented well, but it is impossible to know whether the information given is correct, unless you go to the site and check. The ineffective projects are so numerous that it is difficult to find your way around.In general, it is illusory to think that this market can develop projects or activities that can really compensate for your emissions without any negative climate impact as if the emissions had not originally occurred. To those who want to invest in these projects just to offset their emissions, I can only say one thing – don’t do it.SWI: What would be an example of a ‘good’ project?C.W.: Forestry projects make up the vast majority of offsetting projects and are also the most problematic for compensation purposes. However, there are some interesting projects to reduce emissions from industry and households, or to improve energy efficiency. Many have good potential when they launch, but it all depends on by whom and how they are implemented.SWI: A recent investigation
External link
 showed that most of the certificates issued to protect forests were worthless. That is, they did not represent real reductions in carbon emissions and, in some cases, only shifted the problem of deforestation elsewhere. The Swiss company South Pole was also involved in a controversial project in Zimbabwe. How did this situation come about?* C.W.: Many standards and methodologies currently used in the so-called voluntary carbon markets to define a project are extremely weak and defined by the market itself. That’s why the market should instead be called the “unregulated market”. The emissions that these projects promise to offset or avoid are very often overestimated. Sometimes there is bad project management or controls only take place after a decade. Too much time passes before problems are identified and many certificates have already been sold.As for deforestation, it is well known that it cannot be avoided simply by protecting certain areas. Defining limits within which trees are protected in the name of climate only increases the pressure on the surrounding areas. You cannot stop deforestation without addressing its drivers, and you cannot claim to have a positive impact on the climate just because you protect a small area of land.SWI: Behind the carbon credits we buy to offset our emissions is a long chain of intermediaries
External link
that includes trading companies and certification bodies. Who makes the most money in this market that was worth over $2 billion by 2021
External link
?C.W.: It is hard to say who earns more. What is certain is that most of the money in many projects never reaches the project or community level.The market for carbon credits has existed for some 20 years. There have been periods when the value of credits was almost zero because projects were developed for which there was no demand. It is a trade: some people buy credits cheaply in the hopes that the price will rise. There are people who bought credits for a few cents and now sell them to companies who think they are offsetting their emissions this way and contribute to climate finance flows to the Global South which is often hard to prove.SWI: What is the real benefit to those at the beginning of the chain, namely local populations and their environment?C.W.: It depends on the type of project and the intentions of those implementing them. The fact that project implementation is triggered by carbon markets does not help. Alternative funding without pressure from market forces might have the same if not higher potential to deliver on the promises they make.I am thinking, for example, of wastewater treatment that results in reduced greenhouse gas emissions but at the same time improves local water quality, reduces air pollution, and creates jobs for the local population.Many of those who developed such projects in the early days of the carbon markets had good intentions but abandoned the market long ago. The market growth since then has been realised though projects that do not deliver what they promise.SWI: Verra, the organisation that controls about three-quarters of the world’s carbon offset credits, argues that it will not be possible to meet climate goals without the funding generated from such offset markets. But you said you want to put an end to this system
External link
. Does this not deprive developing countries of important funding from wealthier states?C.W.: The voluntary carbon market, despite impressive marketing operations, is actually very small, almost niche. The amount of money mobilised is small compared to other financial flows. This market allows individuals and companies to declare themselves climate-neutral when in fact they do nothing for the climate. The damage it does to the climate is immensely greater than the funding it generates. There are already alternative funding approaches
External link
ready that would have potential to generate significantly more funding without incentives to delay domestic decarbonisation.SWI: Besides individuals and companies, governments can also offset their emissions by financing climate projects abroad. Switzerland is a pioneer in this regard and has signed bilateral agreements with a dozen nations since 2020. These allow Switzerland to offset a part of its emissions while financing sustainable projects in developing countries, in what sounds like a win-win situation. Is this really the case?C.W.: Financially, yes, but the climate does not benefit and that is a big problem. Switzerland acts within the framework of Article 6 of the Paris Climate Agreement [which allows for emission reductions achieved abroad] and is in this sense a pioneer nation because it developed activities before the rulebook was fully defined. But now it sets the rules itself and I doubt that these are ambitious enough.We looked at the agreement between Switzerland and Georgia
External link
, which aims to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. These are easily achievable measures, the so-called low- hanging fruit, that Georgia had already planned years ago. Now Switzerland is coming forward and says it will take care of the financing. This is certainly a win-win situation for Georgia, which does not have to invest, and for Switzerland, which can use the carbon credits generated as justification for not reducing emissions at home.The international climate community expects a country like Switzerland, given its responsibility and means, to implement emission-reduction measures in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as to make a decent contribution to international climate finance. Switzerland is not on track for either, and Article 6 has the potential to disguise this important fact.Problems with carbon credits have always existed, but with the transition from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, things have become even more complicated.SWI: Why is that?C.W.: Under the Kyoto Protocol, only industrialised countries had to commit to reducing emissions. They could then finance a climate project in the Global South, which was cheaper than action at home, and claim that it would not have been possible without financing through carbon certificates. This is referred to as ‘additionality’. However, this narrative no longer works with the Paris Agreement, because all countries, including developing countries, have reduction targets that must be progressively increased.Developing countries must focus on the most easily achievable and cost-effective emission reductions themselves. For example, protecting forests does not require excessively expensive technology, and each country can do this on its own or by relying on other types of international support if it wants to.If, however, it is developed countries like Switzerland that pay for these low-hanging fruits in the Global South, this creates a double disincentive: recipient countries do not set truly ambitious targets and donor countries can afford not to reduce emissions domestically.The task of industrialised countries, as well as the voluntary carbon market, should instead be to finance the mitigation of the most difficult-to-reduce emissions, so the ‘high-hanging fruits’.SWI: Regulation of the carbon credit market is among the topics being discussed at COP28 in Dubai. How could this market really help address the climate crisis?C.W.: It could only do so if the text of the Paris Agreement is applied to the letter, with all the necessary safeguards. We need solid rules, right down to the details, and a really strict supervisory body that also takes into account countries’ ambitions. But I don’t see any signs of that. It is a political issue, and when so many countries are involved, a compromise is inevitable. But this is not the most ambitious result and is not likely to be in line with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.SWI: Where is the carbon offset market heading? Will it reinvent itself or just ignore all the criticism and continue with business as usual?C.W.: It’s hard to say. If it goes on as it has until now, claiming that the problematic projects and actors are just isolated cases, without recognising that there is an underlying systemic problem, then I hope that the compensation market will soon come to an end.

107,Two Swiss cities join UNESCO ‘creative’ list,"Fribourg was admitted in the “Gastronomy” category and Montreux in the “Music” category, their respective administrations announced on Thursday. This is the first time that Swiss cities have joined the CCN.Both cities had to submit a four-year action plan to be accepted into the network. The action plan for Fribourg, which is famous for its tradition of the bénichon feast, “focuses on innovation in gastronomy”, explained the city administration in a press release.+ Alpinism gains UNESCO heritage statusThe main thrusts of the plan are to strengthen Fribourg as a place of innovation and research in the agri-food sector; to promote education and professional integration and reintegration through gastronomy; and to ensure that gastronomy continues to be a key marketing tool for the city, the document stated.For its part, Montreux plans to “make musical creativity a vector for urban development and integration”, said the municipality in a press release. One of the aims of its four-year plan is to “promote free and inclusive experiences around music”, with, for example, a route through the town centre offering “artistic frescoes and musical experiences” for all.The city, home of the Montreux Jazz Festival, also intends to encourage the emergence of young talent with a special programme called “Les Emergences musicales“. These, along with the “Montreux Jazz Festival Residency”, position the city “as a Mecca for musical creation and education”, according to the municipality.The Creative Cities Network was set up in 2004 to promote international cooperation between cities that have identified creativity as a strategic factor in sustainable urban development. To date, 350 cities are members. The network has seven distinct creative fields: crafts and popular arts, digital arts, cinema, design, gastronomy, literature and music. Only two cities per country can join the network, every two years.","November 9, 2023 - 14:42"
108,Offset scandals put Switzerland in the spotlight at COP28,"On Thursday, more than 190 countries will begin the annual United Nations climate talks in Dubai, in the latest effort to rein in global emissions and provide support to the most vulnerable countries. At the end of what is expected to be the Earth’s hottest year on record, and with scientific warnings of more climate effects to come, they will need to find ways to put the Earth on track to achieve agreed climate goals.After Sultan Al Jaber, the COP28 president and CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, opens the two-week conference, countries will consider the results of the first Global Stocktake, or reality check on the impact of national carbon-cutting pledges on tackling climate change. They will then have to define strategies to keep international efforts in line with keeping the Earth’s temperature rise within +1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.With the stocktake’s technical report
External link
, published in September, showing that countries have made insufficient progress in cutting carbon emissions, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, stressed that “Cop28 must be a clear turning point. Governments must not only agree what stronger climate actions will be taken but also show exactly how to deliver them”.Amid challenges, Felix Wertli, Switzerland’s new climate ambassador, told journalists in Bern ahead of the conference that pushing for more ambition to keep within the 1.5°C limit was the top goal for the delegation at the COP28.He said finding a strategy to exit fossil fuels while boosting strategies for renewable energies and energy efficiency were key. Wertli added that it was also important that the biggest emitters, many of whom included countries that are classified by the UN as developing but wealthy in terms of absolute GDP, such as China and Gulf states, contribute financially towards supporting other developing countries on the frontlines of severe climate impacts.  UN reports have shown that climate finance from developed to developing countries has been lagging, failing to hit the target of $100 billion (CHF88 billion) a year. A loss and damage fund, agreed a year ago to help compensate the poorest, most climate vulnerable for the effects of the climate crisis, is also expected to be discussed in Dubai, after an agreement to house it at the World Bank was reached this month.“There is a lot that we can do, regarding investments to shift sources of energy. That is an opportunity. The IPCC provides policy options to keep 1.5°C within reach,” Wertli told SWI swissinfo.ch. The IPCC, or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this year completed its latest series of scientific reports on the state of the climate on Earth, including its oceans and atmosphere, which includes a series of recommendations.Wertli is replacing Franz Perrez, who had been Switzerland’s climate negotiator since 2010. His nomination came just months after Albert Rösti, of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party, which lobbied against the country’s climate law, took over as environment minister.The ambassador assured that Switzerland would not shift its priorities within the climate negotiations as a result of the new head of the federal department.Switzerland will continue to chair the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), a negotiating group that also includes Georgia, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco and South Korea.According to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), the efforts that countries will have to take will be substantial. On November 20, it said countries would have to cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to avoid the current trajectory of temperatures rising by 2.5°C to 2.9°C by that date.Beyond pushing for further cuts in the use and production of fossil fuels, one issue that has remained unresolved at the climate talks has been clear rules regarding carbon offsetting.

The video below explains how offsets work.Such mechanisms, which may include forest preservation and tree planting and are widely used by companies to help them meet their climate targets, have come under scrutiny for the methods used to calculate the emissions they offset. The Paris climate agreement inked in 2015 specifies two types of offsets. Article 6 refers to both agreements between governments to cooperate on compensating emissions by supporting sustainable projects in developing countries that would have otherwise not taken place, and to the “voluntary” carbon market.Switzerland pioneered the former when it concluded bilateral agreements with a number of countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia, while campaigning at the 2021 climate summit in Glasgow for more specifics how offset agreements should be implemented.Despite rising criticism on the effect of offsets to limit emissions, Wertli said measures included in the bilateral agreements included “enough safeguards”. He said these included the avoidance of double counting of the impact the projects have on avoidance of carbon emissions.His comments come on the back of recent reports pointing

issued over one billion credits – equivalent to one billion tonnes worth of CO2 – 90% of which were “phantom” or largely worthless. Verra has said that reporting about the company has been “off track”, while South Pole has severed ties with a major offset project in Zimbabwe at the centre of its scandal and disputes the allegations.Critics say that companies and countries alike may rely too heavily on the credits generated from the system.“The whole premise of offsetting is that you can continue business as usual and pay for credit that’s generated elsewhere. It’s a flawed premise,” Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), told SWI swissinfo.ch.“What the climate needs is full rapid emissions reductions now, across the board of fossil fuels, and not keep emitting on the notion that we can buy an emissions reduction credit from some activity elsewhere,” she said, adding that countries and companies could also provide finance to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation projects.Earlier this year, the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance

for guidance on carbon removals and mechanism methodologies for approval at the talks, a year after they were expected to do so.Lennon remains reluctant towards the offsets. “You’re not reducing anything, and you’re not staying below 1.5°C. It’s not taking the action we need.”Patrick Hofstetter, climate and energy policy head at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Switzerland and part of the wider Swiss negotiating team in Dubai, said that in Switzerland the government scheme would need a “reality check”. He said that the Klik Foundation, responsible for financing the bilaterally agreed offsets, is by its own admission lagging behind in helping the country, according to law, achieve its climate targets and reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2030.The government, he said, would have to pitch in financially to help fill the gap.“Understandably, with reports of flawed projects regarding voluntary carbon markets, some care should be taken before you agree to a project,” he warned.Nonetheless, he said that in spite of the negative visuals of a major oil and gas producer hosting the climate talks, some hopeful signs ahead of the COP may be in sight.He pointed to the recent talks between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on cooperation over climate issues, as well as the possibility that Al Jaber, as a representative of the OPEC oil producing countries bloc, may pressure Saudi Arabia “not to make this conference a disaster as Saudis may be more willing to agree than what they would had this conference been taking place outside an OPEC country”.“That could make for an interesting constellation,” he added.Edited by Virginie ManginThis article was amended to add a reaction from South Pole.

109,How a Swiss-led global network fosters greater access to AI ,"+ Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inboxAI is widely acknowledged as a breakthrough technology that can power rapid advances in many areas of scientific research, from weather predictions to medicine and energy. But there is also a danger that resource-rich countries and companies could monopolise the new generation of powerful computers. While perceived as slow to adapt national laws to govern the use of AI domestically, Switzerland has now earned praise on the international stage for promoting the sharing of AI expertise and experience worldwide. + Swiss diplomat defends role in European AI treatyThe Swiss-led initiative, called the International Computation and AI Network (ICAIN), aims to matchmake scientific projects in developing nations with the most cutting-edge supercomputers and the world’s best AI know-how to create a level playing field. “We observe a huge power imbalance,” Katharina Frey, deputy head of digital foreign policy at the Swiss foreign ministry, told SWI swissinfo.ch. “There are a handful of companies worldwide capable of developing large-scale models, while the majority of the world does not have access to this level of computing power.” Besides the Swiss foreign ministry, the founding members of ICAIN also include the federal institutes of technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) and Lausanne (EPFL), the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems, Data Science Africa, plus supercomputer centres in Switzerland and Finland. “It is important that ICAIN is pushing back against inequality of access to AI,” said Ciira Maina, chair of Data Science Africa. “Big tech is in itself not a bad thing – we all use the products. But it’s important to have a varied ecosystem in place.”  Launched in January, ICAIN supports two science projects in Africa and an AI initiative with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Each project is granted access to supercomputers and leading academic AI experts.  The ICAIN network closely follows a United Nations call for equal access to AI. In a September report, the UN singled out ICAIN as an example of how global resource-sharing AI networks can promote sustainability goals. “Advanced economies have both the capability and duty to facilitate AI capacity-building through international collaboration,” the report reads.  In the context of ICAIN, what are the practical implications of this? According to Maina, who’s also a professor of electrical engineering and data science at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Kenya, international collaboration can boost African research into weather predictions and identifying crop diseases. + Could Switzerland take the lead on AI ethics?“Bringing on board more computing power is an exciting new ingredient because it means we can do this research on a larger scale,” said Maina. “ICAIN has unlocked high-quality expertise and access to high-level computers.” AI is able to crunch more data in machines that can be trained to “think” for themselves, learning as they go along. This leads to a higher rate of computation and a greater variety of solutions to problems. This computational bounty could also prove beneficial to the humanitarian work carried out by the ICRC. The ICRC relies on vast amounts of case files and field notes obtained from their workers on the ground, supplemented by data from satellites, for example. The ICRC hopes that Large Language Models – AI systems trained to understand and interpret large volumes of data – can make better sense of the continuous flow of ever-changing data that derives from chaotic situations, allowing it to better plan and mobilise operations. “We see how AI is reshaping warfare and the direct impact this has on civilians in conflict zones,” said Blaise Robert, who advises the humanitarian organisation on AI. “AI also presents important potential to improve the way we deliver humanitarian aid.” It is also important to the ICRC that ICAIN allows it to retain complete control over sensitive data.  “Retaining the trust of the people we talk with in sensitive situations depends on our capacity to maintain the confidentiality of that dialogue,” said Robert. “It’s very important that the ICRC keeps very tight control of its data. We need to be certain we are not dependent on certain actors who could later bring negative operational consequences.” Maina from Data Science Africa praised Switzerland for taking the initiative to get ICAIN off the ground. “Many people have been talking about the AI inequality problem, but sometimes it takes leadership to bring the right people together in the same room to solve problems collaboratively,” he said. “We have started with a seed that can hopefully fuel more global interaction and bring new partners on board.” Switzerland may have initiated ICAIN, but the Swiss foreign ministry says it has no desire to control its operations and continued growth into other regions of the world. The plan is to create an independent legal entity in Switzerland that will manage the matchmaking between scientific projects and AI resources. Details of the association are yet to be released but the idea is to free the body from any suggestion of political interference by countries. “We absolutely need initiatives that aim to create alternatives to the current political economy behind AI, which is dominated by a handful of enormously big global companies,” Angela Müller, executive director of the NGO Algorithm Watch Switzerland, told SWI swissinfo.ch.  “ICAIN should not limit itself to focusing on how we can use more and more AI to promote sustainability or justice, but also on how we can make AI itself more sustainable and just,” she said.

110,US to pledge $3 billion for Green Climate Fund at COP28 – sources,"By Nandita Bose and Valerie VolcoviciDUBAI (Reuters) -The United States will pledge $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, sources familiar with matter said on Saturday as Vice President Kamala Harris arrived in Dubai for the U.N. climate summit.The fund, with more than $20 billion in pledges, is the largest international fund dedicated to supporting climate action in developing countries.The latest pledge, which Reuters was first to report, would be additional to another $2 billion previously delivered by the United States. The sources said the pledge was subject to the availability of funds.Harris was expected to announce the pledge later on Saturday in an address to the COP28 summit.The fund’s facilitators said in October that the current second round of replenishments had brought in about $9.3 billion in pledges to fund projects in climate-vulnerable counties between 2024 and 2027.Even so, pledges so far represent a fraction of roughly $250 billion that developing countries would need every year by 2030 just to adapt to a warmer world. In addition to supporting climate adaptation, the fund also finances projects to help countries shift to clean energy.A U.S. climate official said the vice president would tell the summit that the world needs to “make sure that everybody is at the table, and everybody is stepping up. Everybody has to step up.”Harris, who is representing the United States at COP28 in place of President Joe Biden, is part of a U.S. delegation that also includes climate envoy John Kerry and dozens of senior officials.“It was important for both the president and vice president to ensure that a leader from the United States was at COP,” an official said, adding that Harris wanted to “make sure we are telling the world the story of progress that we have made in the U.S.”___For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here.(Reporting by Nandita Bose and Valerie Volcovici, Writing by William James, Editing by Elizabeth Piper, Katy Daigle and Edwina Gibbs)","December 2, 2023 - 08:24"
111,Germany’s Scholz to visit Serbia for EU raw materials agreement,"BERLIN (Reuters) – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will travel to Serbia and hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday, a German government spokesperson said, naming critical raw materials as a key theme of the trip.Scholz is set to attend a critical raw materials summit together with European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, during which Serbia will sign a memorandum of understanding with the European Union on a strategic partnership over sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains and electric cars.“The background to this is a project for sustainable lithium mining in Serbia. Overall, it is about the further development of a European raw materials agenda and the derisking of raw material sources,” the spokesperson said at a regular government news conference in Berlin on Wednesday.The visit comes after the Serbian government reinstated a licence for Rio Tinto to develop Europe’s biggest lithium mine in a potential boost to the continent’s electric vehicle industry.If developed, the $2.4 billion Jadar lithium project in western Serbia could cover 90% of Europe’s current lithium needs and help make the company a leading lithium producer.However, there has been strong opposition to the project from environmental activists and opposition parties in Serbia.","July 17, 2024 - 14:11"
112,Ukraine starts to rebuild towns and cities even as the war rages on,"By Dan PeleschukTROSTIANETS, Ukraine (Reuters) – An excavator belches out fumes as it clears earth and rubble from between the train and bus stations in the Ukrainian town of Trostianets to make way for a reimagined transport hub.Badly damaged in fighting with Russian forces almost two years ago, Trostianets is one of six settlements being rebuilt with state funds in a pilot programme to develop the skills and experience needed for a far broader reconstruction drive later.Mayor Yuriy Bova said time was running out to breathe life back into towns, or risk losing millions of Ukrainians who could help redevelop the country to permanent exile in Europe.“We’re fighting for every person who should return; for every child who needs to return and build their future here,” he told Reuters in the town, barely 30 km (20 miles) from Russia.“To walk around and see this every day, that will morally traumatise a person,” Bova said of the ruined northeastern town. “We need to restore everything, starting with cafes, libraries, factories, schools, hospitals.”Officials in Kyiv have also signaled the urgence of rebuilding Ukraine, an effort that will require hundreds of billions of dollars and involve more than quick fixes to critical sites such as hospitals, power stations and railways.The war, however, shows no signs of abating. Short on cash, Ukraine is defending against new Russian attacks after its own counteroffensive failed to yield significant gains. Moscow has also resumed a campaign of mass air strikes on population centres far beyond the front line.For Pavlo Kuzmenko, the mayor of Okhtyrka, a town only 20 km down the road from Trostianets that also bears the scars of heavy Russian bombing at the start of the war, resurrecting town squares is a luxury Ukraine cannot afford right now.Officials in Okhtyrka were slow to finish clearing away the rubble on the main boulevard that was once the city hall and have not yet fixed the gutted department store across the street. Most schools, however, have been repaired with new windows, roofing or bomb shelters, thanks in large part to international donors.Kuzmenko, who publicly criticised the plans for Trostianets last year and bemoaned a lack of resources, said the focus should be on patching up homes and critical infrastructure only. Any other available funds should go to the military.“There is plenty to rebuild,” Kuzmenko told Reuters. “Squares, and all their decorations, can be done after the war.”Standing near the remains of the city hall, Okhtyrka resident Antonina Dmytrychenko, 65, said she agreed with her mayor: “First we need victory, then reconstruction.”The different views in the neighbouring towns reflect a broader debate about wartime spending playing out across Ukraine. Most visibly, a growing grassroots protest movement is demanding that discretionary projects, such as sprucing up streets and public spaces, be shelved in favour of the military.‘ECONOMIES WIN WARS’In a sign of the tension, officials in the Odesa region cancelled more than $9 million of tenders during the last three months of 2023, saying spending on things such as road repairs, the renovation of a stadium and software was “unacceptable” during wartime.The disputes highlight the need for a clearly communicated government strategy for what recovery and, more broadly, a war-adapted economy should look like, said Orysia Lutsevych at the Chatham House think-tank in London.She said officials must urgently unlock Ukraine’s economic potential by restoring income-generating growth opportunities that can help defeat Russia – and that meant luring people back as well as stopping more leaving the country for good.“Militaries win battles, but economies win wars. It’s part of the same equation,” she said.It might make sense, for example, to build more schools in the comparably safer western city of Lviv for the many Ukrainians displaced there by fighting elsewhere, so they will stay and contribute to the wartime economy, Lutsevych said.“This is what rebuilding is: maybe it’s not fancy playgrounds, maybe it’s not new zoos,” she said. “But it must be a category of projects that fits within the wider strategy of how Ukraine will sustain this war.”One of the officials in charge of rebuilding Ukraine, Mustafa Nayyem, acknowledged that reviving heavily damaged towns such as Trostianets would require major administrative muscle.“The state has never done a comprehensive reconstruction of settlements before,” Nayyem, head of Ukraine’s Agency for Restoration and Infrastructure Development, told Reuters. “We don’t have that kind of experience.”That’s why Kyiv picked six projects, each with different challenges, to be financed by a state fund comprised mainly of seized Russian assets. The aim was a complete transformation of those places into something better, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said when unveiling the programme in April.In one case, a village is being entirely rebuilt, another is undergoing mass repairs of housing, while in Trostianets, which is home to a Mondelez chocolate factory, the focus is on several key projects in part to help restore economic life.The skills required range from the often painstaking work of establishing legal ownership of properties going back generations to replanning entire apartment blocks or new energy networks.‘NOT RENEWING LIBRARIES’So far, more than $1.6 billion has been earmarked from the fund for reconstruction, Prime Minister Shmyhal said in October. The pilot projects received about $86 million last year, though the 2024 budget has not yet been set, a spokesperson for the reconstruction agency said.Overall, the World Bank has estimated that rebuilding Ukraine will cost more than $400 billion over the next decade, and Western lenders have signalled they are prepared to provide the bulk of the financing.But the ongoing war has made long-term planning difficult, Nayyem said, citing the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in June. The disaster forced his agency to rush to build a critical water supply line in southeastern Ukraine in a matter of months, sapping time and resources.What officials can plan for, Nayyem said, was the “infrastructure of reconstruction” – firming up standards and procedures, building teams and nurturing relationships with international partners.“These are things that we are developing to the maximum in preparation for the moment when we can allow ourselves to, more or less, plan in greater detail,” he said. “And it isn’t necessarily only after our victory.”Nayyem defended the pilot projects against critics such as Kuzmenko, saying no one was rebuilding anything unnecessary, just homes and the services people need to live.He said strategic roads facilitating military movements or trade across Ukraine, as well as administrative buildings, should also be priorities.“We’re not renewing libraries or museums,” he said.In Trostianets, the plan is to restore two apartment blocks, three medical facilities, the train station, the square, another building nearby and a main road through the town.Money from international donors, meanwhile, has already helped rebuild a new wing of the main city hospital.“We believe our town will become even better, to the detriment of our enemies,” said Natalia Androsova, 60, one of the many locals in Trostianets who praised mayor Bova for his leadership and for attracting state funding.The five other pilot projects are in Borodianka and Moshchun near the capital Kyiv, Yahidne in the north, Tsyrkuny in the east, and Posad-Pokrovske in the south.Despite the damage in Okhtyrka, which resisted a Russian onslaught despite three weeks of intense shelling, the town is full of life as families criss-cross a park and celebrate special occasions at one of several popular restaurants.But some yearn for a sense of normalcy beyond critical or immediate needs. Yaroslav Bybyk, 19, said he wished officials would do more to revive the cultural and youth scene which flourished there before the war.“I haven’t gone out much in the last few months,” he said. “I don’t see the point.”","January 18, 2024 - 14:30"
113,"In UN talks for a global plastic treaty, delegates to face off over production limits","By Valerie Volcovici(Reuters) – As the world’s nations enter another round of talks this week on creating a first-ever treaty to contain plastic pollution, officials are bracing for tough negotiations over whether to limit the amount of plastic being produced or just to focus on the management of waste.Working with a document called a “zero draft” that lists possible policies and actions to consider, national delegates to the weeklong meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, will be debating which of those options to include in what eventually would become a legally binding treaty by the end of 2024, officials involved in the negotiations said.“We are at a pivotal moment in this process,” said Andres Del Castillo, a senior attorney of the Center for International Environmental Law who is an observer to the negotiations.The world is currently producing about 400 million metric tons of plastic waste every year, with less than 10% of it being recycled, according to the UN Environment Programme, choking landfills and despoiling oceans. That produced amount is set to surge in the coming decade, as oil companies, which often also produce plastics, look to new sources of revenue amid the energy transition away from fossil fuels.Today, about 98% of single-use plastic – like bottles or packaging -is derived from fossil fuel, according to the U.N. Environment Programme.The European Union and dozens of countries, including Japan, Canada and Kenya have called for -a strong treaty with “binding provisions” for reducing the production and use of virgin plastic polymers derived from petrochemicals and for eliminating or restricting problematic plastics, such as PVC and others containing toxic ingredients.That position is opposed by the plastic industry and by oil and petrochemical exporters like Saudi Arabia, who want to see plastic use continue. They argue that the treaty should focus on recycling and reusing plastics, sometimes referred to in the talks as “circularity” in the plastics supply.In a submission ahead of this week’s negotiations, Saudi Arabia said the root cause of plastic pollution was “inefficient management of waste.”The United States, which initially wanted a treaty comprised of national plans to control plastics, has revised its stance in recent months. It now argues that, while the treaty should still be based on national plans, those plans should reflect globally agreed goals to reduce plastic pollution that are “meaningful and feasible,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.The International Council of Chemical Associations wants the treaty to include measures “that accelerate a circular economy for plastics,” according to council spokesperson Matthew Kastner.“The plastics agreement should be focused on ending plastic pollution, not plastic production,” Kastner told Reuters in a statement. For oil, gas and petrochemical producers and exporters, a strong treaty is liability that could curb the sale of fossil fuels, said Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator of the International Pollutants Elimination Network.Saudi Arabia and other producers are “pushing a ‘bottom up’ approach that makes individual countries responsible for the cleanup, health, and environmental costs of plastics and chemicals while leaving the fossil fuels and plastics industries off the hook,” Beeler said.On Saturday, Saudi Arabia launched a coalition with countries including Russia, Iran, Cuba, China, and Bahrain called Global Coalition for Plastics Sustainability that will push for the treaty to focus on waste rather than production controls.Countries will also be debating whether the treaty should set transparency standards for chemical use in plastics production.But before they can work on the substantive points, delegates will need to resolve procedural objections that slowed the talks in June when Saudi Arabia said decisions should be adopted by a consensus rather than by majority. A consensus would allow one country to block the ability to make decisions to advance development of the treaty. Most other countries did not support the intervention.The Saudi delegation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Environmental groups said they hoped this week’s talks can focus on the treaty’s substance, and move beyond the procedural discussions that stall progress.“We need a radical rethink of the global plastics economy and cannot get bogged down by derailing tactics and false solutions,” said Christina Dixon of the Environmental Investigation Agency.On Sunday, a group of 20 international scientists sent an open letter to negotiators asking them to put health at the heart of the talks, and aim for a treaty that reduces production volumes of plastics and “mandates proper testing of all chemicals in plastics.”(This story has been corrected to change the attribution of the quote to Andres del Castillo of CIEL in paragraph 3)(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Katy Daigle and Aurora Ellis, Kirsten Donovan)","November 12, 2023 - 18:12"
114,"Carbon-neutral flying by 2050 is possible, says Swiss government","On Wednesday the Federal Council (executive body) approved a report on carbon-neutral flying by 2050 that sets out technical measures for climate-friendly aviation.The use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) will be the key measure to reduce fossil CO2 emissions, the government said in a press release in reply to a postulate from the House of Representative’s Environment Committee.Efficiency savings in aircraft fleets and operations will also play a role. But hydrogen-fuelled and electric aircraft can only marginally reduce emissions – at least up to 2050, the report’s authors stated.Instruments already exist or are being developed to achieve Swiss climate objectives. The CO2 Act for the period after 2024 also provides for new mechanisms to encourage the aviation industry to act.The federal government will introduce new subsidies to support the aviation industry in its efforts to become carbon neutral. With the existing instruments and those planned from 2025, the federal government can set a course for a 70% reduction in carbon emissions from Swiss air traffic, the report said. But in order to fully achieve the net-zero target by 2050, carbon sequestration and storage (negative emission technologies) is also required.Translated from French by Deepl/sb","February 21, 2024 - 11:45"
115,What lies ahead for Switzerland: the economic outlook for 2024,"The sluggish economy in the eurozone and interest rate rises in many countries will continue to have an impact on the Swiss economy next year. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) is forecasting GDP growth of 1.1%, down from 1.3% in 2023, the second year in a row that growth will be well below average. As a result of the more restrictive monetary policy pursued by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), inflation should continue to fall next year, dropping below the 2% mark.Despite the stagnation of the economy and the expected slight rise in unemployment (from 2% in 2023 to 2.3%), the shortage of qualified personnel is set to persist in Switzerland, as in other advanced economies. The staff shortage index has risen by a further 24% in 2023, according to data published at the end of November by the placement company Adecco and the University of Zurich’s Swiss Labour Market Monitor.More than 120,000 vacancies existed at the end of August, when the latest figures from the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) were published. The sectors in which jobs are hardest to fill are healthcare, IT and engineering. As for the salary increases planned by companies (2% on average), these are likely to be largely absorbed by inflation once again.Swiss tourism was back in full swing in 2023, with overnight stays expected to top the 40 million mark for the first time. The coming months also look promising: the Swiss Economic Institute (KOF) at federal technology institute ETH Zurich is forecasting an increase of 270,000 overnight stays throughout Switzerland this winter.With the strength of the Swiss franc, inflation and reduced purchasing power, the overall situation for the sector is rather poor. But according to Simon Wiget, director of Verbier Tourism, Switzerland stands out from the crowd because it offers a haven of peace in the midst of a world in turmoil. “In today’s anxiety-filled environment, people want to be reassured. And Switzerland offers a lot of security,” he told Swiss public television, RTS.But compared with 2019, the year before the pandemic, Switzerland is still missing some foreign guests, particularly those from faraway countries such as China, India, Japan and the Gulf monarchies. The situation concerning tourists from China is not expected to return to normal before the end of next year, according to Véronique Kanel, spokeswoman for Switzerland Tourism.Following a year of restructuring, big acquisitions and leadership changes, Swiss pharma will look to create some positive buzz and assure investors of their growth potential in 2024. Shortly after spinning off its generics division Sandoz in October, Novartis dialled up its five-year sales forecast as it focuses on so-called innovative therapies – on-patent treatments that have the highest profit potential.The dust is also settling for Roche as the surge of Covid-19 test sales disappears from the balance sheet. CEO Thomas Schinecker, who will celebrate one year in the post in March, made a couple of big acquisitions in 2023 that could help make up for recent clinical trial disappointments and replace blockbusters nearing patent expiration.With these investments, Swiss pharma will try to steal some limelight from peers such as  Denmark’s Novo Nordisk, which dominated headlines in 2023 with anti-obesity drugs. Roche hopes its recent $2.7 billion (CHF2.3 billion) acquisition of a US biotech with obesity drugs in the pipeline will help it capture some

of what analysts predict could be a $100 billion market in ten years.The industry won’t be able to escape pressure to lower prices next year though. Even in wealthy Switzerland, a major increase in mandatory health insurance premiums has triggered questions about how much drug prices are to blame.The greatest pressure is coming from the United States, where the government is moving forwards with negotiations on drug prices under the US Inflation Reduction Act. In December, the US government took another swipe at the industry, announcing plans to seize patents developed with government funding if drug prices are too high. This will all play into Swiss pharma’s investment and marketing decisions next year.Switzerland’s largest global companies will continue to navigate the tug-of-war between China and the United States, and wider de-globalisation forces in 2024. Many companies see China as key to their growth strategy despite the country’s recent economic woes, human rights worries, and competing trade tariffs between the US and China.Swiss companies will also face more domestic pressure, as the Responsible Business Initiative, which narrowly failed in a nationwide vote in 2020, makes a comeback. Campaigners have announced plans for a new version of the initiative next year aimed at holding companies accountable for their human rights and environmental impacts in global supply chains. They argue Switzerland needs to stay apace with regulation in the European Union, which is finalising a corporate accountability law.One question hanging over multinationals is how the global deal for a minimum corporate tax rate will get rolled out and affect business location decisions. Switzerland will start to implement

the 15% corporate tax rate as of January 2024 but many countries including the US, China, Brazil and India have no plans to implement the minimum corporate tax rate.After two years of strong growth, the Swiss machinery, electrical equipment and metals industry (MEM industries) is going through a difficult period. The industry’s umbrella association, Swissmem, does not hesitate to speak of a recession.In the first nine months of 2023, new orders fell by 9.9% compared with the same period last year. The rise in interest rates decided by central banks in recent months is weighing on the sales of an industry that employs more than 325,000 people in Switzerland and exports almost 80% of its production (60% of which to the EU).Given the economic difficulties being experienced by Switzerland’s main partners, led by Germany, China and the United States, the outlook for the coming months is no more encouraging. “Most companies in the sector can expect a difficult period ahead,” said Stefan Brupbacher, director of Swissmem, at the end of November.Buoyed by a luxury sector that is not experiencing the crisis, Swiss watch exports are heading for a new record in 2023: in the first 11 months of the year, they exceeded the CHF24 billion ($27.7 billion) mark, up 7.7% on 2022. The Swiss watch industry now employs more than 65,000 people, a level not seen since the 1970s.     However, this period of exceptional growth, which has continued since the post-Covid recovery of 2021, is set to come to an end soon. “In the short term, caution is called for because of the geopolitical context, inflation and the strength of the Swiss franc, particularly among subcontractors who are facing postponed orders,” says Jean-Daniel Pasche, president of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.The Vontobel bank also expects a “normalisation of growth” for 2024, with an increase in the value of exports of between 2% and 4%. “Strong brands that have invested in marketing and their distribution network will continue to grow. For other brands, the situation is much more fragile: volumes will have to be revised downwards,” reckons Jean-Philippe Bertschy, a watch expert at Vontobel.In the longer term, however, Pasche still sees opportunities for growth in established markets such as the United States and China, as well as in emerging markets such as India, Brazil and Indonesia.The impact of Credit Suisse’s collapse will continue to dominate the Swiss financial sector in 2024 and likely lead to a reshuffling of the regulatory deck of cards.UBS, which bought the ailing Credit Suisse in March, has warned that 2024 will prove the toughest year for integration as it grapples with merging different IT, accounting and business systems.The success of the merger is critical for Switzerland’s entire financial industry. If it fails, Switzerland will face an uncertain future without a major international banking player.This threat has once again sharpened the thoughts of regulators and lawmakers to making the banking system safer. The debate around how exactly to do this will become even louder and more fractious in the coming months.The main areas of debate are: giving regulators greater powers to control bad banking behaviour, forcing banks to hold more liquidity to stave off bank runs and the role of the central bank and the state in propping up failing institutions.Connected to this debate is the ongoing parliamentary commission that is probing the background to Credit Suisse’s collapse to determine what went wrong and who was to blame.The commission will present its findings in 2024, which will have a bearing on what measures are deemed necessary in future to prevent a repeat banking catastrophe.Other countries are circling in the hope of snatching away a chunk of offshore wealth from Swiss vaults. Switzerland remains the number one wealth management centre, managing CHF2.2 trillion of assets belonging to foreign private individuals.It remains to be seen how the collapse of Credit Suisse, along with Swiss sanctions against wealthy Russians, will influence Switzerland’s reputation in the coming years.Two other major ongoing themes are sustainable finance and the role of technological advances in the financial system.The finance ministry has warned banks to expect binding laws on sustainable finance in 2024 if the current self-regulatory system fails to protect against greenwashing.On the technology side, the Swiss National Bank, the country’s main stock exchange and commercial banks will step up experiments with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to bring about promised efficiency gains for trading.Edited by Virginie Mangin and Samuel Jaberg","December 27, 2023 - 09:00"

However, it is also straining services such as housing and transport and stirring resentment among locals.How to make the boom sustainable and share its benefits more widely are the tasks facing Spain’s decision-makers, and some of them think driving tourism upmarket is the way forward.But for the Rebollo family from Mexico, affordability is one of the factors that makes Spain so attractive, along with its cultural highlights.Rebollo, 45, said their recent vacation at home had cost them the equivalent of 2,500 euros ($2,700).“Here we are going to spend a little more than that, but getting to know other countries, paying for plane tickets and tours,” she said. “The truth is that it is very good value for money.”Millions of other visitors agree and the tourism surge has helped put Spain, long the laggard among Europe’s big economies, into the lead, now outperforming the wider 20-country euro zone, which grew a scant 0.3% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to Spain’s 0.7%.While France cut its 2024 growth forecast and Germany only just skirted a recession, held back by a dependence on industry and a vulnerability to fluctuations in commodity prices and geopolitical tensions, Spain expects its economy to grow 2% this year.Expansion is being driven by growth in services as well as public and private consumption fueled by job growth, said Angel Talavera, head of European economics at Oxford Economics.Tourism accounted for 71% of real growth in the Spanish economy last year, according to tourism lobby group Exceltur. Consumption by non-residents accounted for nearly a third of Spain’s 2.5% growth in 2023, according to BBVA.But many Spaniards feel they are not reaping the benefits, and the driver of Spain’s success is increasingly being met with protests.“It is true that we are going like gangbusters, but this phenomenon must be managed,” Tourism Minister Jordi Hereu said on May 8. “We are not going to ban people from coming to Spain, but we can put limits on the tourist offer.”Measures are already being taken, with local governments placing limits on new holiday home permits.In Barcelona, local authorities asked for a bus route to be removed from smartphone apps to the popular tourist destination Park Guell because the service was saturated.Nor are Spaniards getting the feel-good factor from the boom. An April survey by the Spanish Sociological Research Centre found that although 60% of Spaniards acknowledged that their personal economic situation was “good”, 59% also said the situation in the country was “bad” or “very bad”.Cheaper wages are drawing investment in new hotels, which are opening at a rate of one every four days, allowing Spain to overtake the UK this year as the most attractive country in Europe for hospitality investors, according to CBRE.UNDER-PRICEDAntonio Catalan, president of AC Hotels, Marriott’s partner in Spain, said his hotels had seen a 17% rise in foreign visitors in the first quarter who were spending 27% more, due mainly to higher room rates.“Spain is under-priced and has too many customers,” he said.A record 85 million people visited in 2023 and that upward trend continued in the first quarter of this year, with visitor numbers growing nearly 18% to 16.1 million, although that may have been boosted by Easter falling within the period this year.Those who come are spending more, thanks in part to efforts to develop the luxury market, which some regions see as a solution to overtourism.Visitors to Spain last year spent 109 billion euros versus 63.5 billion euros in France as tourists flexed their credit cards in restaurants and designer stores.Foreign tourist spending grew by 27% in the first quarter from a year earlier.Tourism has also helped boost job growth, with unemployment falling to a 16-year low even as immigration helps fill vacancies in the services sector.The sector created 197,630 more jobs in the first quarter compared to last year, representing one out of every four jobs created during the period, according to Turespaña, the state-run agency that promotes Spanish tourism.Those new jobs are helping to boost private consumption to complement spending by tourists.But Oxford Economics’ Talavera warned Spain’s economic boom was not sustainable.“Tourism cannot grow at this rate permanently, nor can public spending continue its expansion,” he said.Rebollo and her daughter, meanwhile, planned to spend two weeks in Europe, including a few days in France, “but we’ll spend more time in Spain because we’ve noticed it isn’t expensive and Paris is,” she said.($1 = 0.9245 euros)","May 21, 2024 - 08:37"
117,UBS Moves Into Debt Swap Market Pioneered by Credit Suisse,"(Bloomberg) — UBS Group AG is working on its first-ever ESG debt swap, building on expertise it inherited from Credit Suisse after taking over the bank last year. UBS will form part of a consortium of firms working to raise funds for a $300 million refinancing arrangement for Barbados that will help fund climate-resilient infrastructure, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private talks. The transaction, which also involves a group of local banks, is expected to close in September, the person said.A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment.The arrangement, a variation on so-called debt-for-nature swaps, will be UBS’s first foray into a market that has been pioneered by Credit Suisse.The swaps are designed to help governments retire old debt in exchange for new, cheaper loans, with savings assigned to environmental protection. Though similar structures have existed for decades, Credit Suisse reconfigured the model back in 2021 to introduce private investors for the first time.Credit Suisse has restructured about $2.3 billion of debt for governments spanning Belize to Ecuador, resulting in some $1.2 billion of new financing dedicated to nature conservation. That includes a $150 million deal for Barbados completed in 2022.Though still a niche market, some of the world’s biggest banks have shown interest in getting a foothold. Bloomberg previously reported that lenders exploring debt-for-nature swaps include Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Standard Chartered Plc and Citigroup Inc. Last year, Bank of America Corp. struck its first deal with a $500 million swap for Gabon.UBS’s involvement in the Barbados deal underlines its gradual expansion into nature finance markets following its takeover of Credit Suisse. Last month, UBS held its first-ever conference dedicated to biodiversity finance, which the bank said was so popular that it had to turn some financial professionals away. Its philanthropic arm is currently exploring the use of carbon and biodiversity credits to help build a business model for marine-protected areas. And last year, UBS’s asset management arm launched a so-called natural-capital engagement program. While the first half of 2024 has seen no new debt-for-nature swaps involving private investors, about four are likely to be completed by the end of December, the person familiar said. Bank of America and another US bank are working on some of them, the person said. A spokesperson for Bank of America declined to comment.The swap underway for Barbados is designed to free up funds to help the country upgrade a sewage treatment plant, which will reduce water use and pollution. The deal, which is being marketed as a debt-for-climate swap, is the first of its kind to target climate resilience and will help Barbados meet its national goals under the Paris Agreement. The refinancing will be funded with at least $300 million of new sustainability-linked debt, which will be raised through local currency loans and a new US dollar-denominated bond, said Sebastian Espinosa, managing director at White Oak Advisory Ltd., which designed the transaction and is advising Barbados. Barbados has about $2 billion in local currency and dollar-denominated bonds outstanding, including a $530 million dollar bond due in 2029, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s unclear which debt the country is targeting for the buyback.Last week, the European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank approved joint guarantees for the deal, which will help reduce the cost of the new borrowing for Barbados. Private-sector guarantees as big as $75 million also are being targeted, Espinosa said. If achieved, these will help boost the size of the deal by as much as 20%, he said.The arrangement targets “many firsts” that will make the “new debt swap architecture the most efficient and scalable to date,” Espinosa said. That includes a joint guarantee from the EIB and IDB and the involvement of private-sector guarantors, as well as a focus on climate resilience instead of marine conservation, he said. Barbados is targeting savings of up to $130 million over 15 years, Espinosa said. Part of that will be used to service a new $40 million loan from the United Nations Green Climate Fund and another $60 million loan from IDB that, together with a $60 million grant from the GCF, will fund the sewage plant upgrade, he said. The remaining $30 million will be used to finance ancillary water security projects.The swap “exemplifies how innovative climate financing can drive meaningful change, ensuring a sustainable future for our people and our planet,” Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a statement released last week. It’s a “powerful, scalable model” for other vulnerable nations to follow, she said. –With assistance from Ezra Fieser, Jorgelina do Rosario and Greg Ritchie.(Updates 13th paragraph with details of Barbados debt.)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","August 1, 2024 - 10:12"

120,China lands on moon’s far side in historic sample-retrieval mission,"By Liz Lee, Joey Roulette, Joe Brock and Eduardo BaptistaBEIJING (Reuters) -China landed an uncrewed spacecraft on the far side of the moon on Sunday, overcoming a key hurdle in its landmark mission to retrieve the world’s first rock and soil samples from the dark lunar hemisphere.The landing elevates China’s space power status in a global rush to the moon, where countries including the United States are hoping to exploit lunar minerals to sustain long-term astronaut missions and moon bases within the next decade.The Chang’e-6 craft, equipped with an array of tools and its own launcher, touched down in a gigantic impact crater called the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the moon’s space-facing side at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time (2223 GMT), the China National Space Administration said.The mission “involves many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty”, the agency said in a statement on its website. “The payloads carried by the Chang’e-6 lander will work as planned and carry out scientific exploration missions.”The successful mission is China’s second on the far side of the moon, a region no other country has reached. The side of the moon perpetually facing away from the Earth is dotted with deep and dark craters, making communications and robotic landing operations more challenging.Given these challenges, lunar and space experts involved in the Chang’e-6 mission described the landing phase as a moment where the chance of failure is the highest.“Landing on the far side of the moon is very difficult because you don’t have line-of-sight communications, you’re relying on a lot of links in the chain to control what is going on, or you have to automate what is going on,” said Neil Melville-Kenney, a technical officer at the European Space Agency working with China on one of the Chang’e-6 payloads.“Automation is very difficult especially at high latitudes because you have long shadows which can be very confusing for landers,” Melville added.The Chang’e-6 probe launched on May 3 on China’s Long March 5 rocket from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan, reaching the lunar vicinity roughly a week later before tightening its orbit in preparation for a landing.Chang’e-6 marks the world’s third lunar landing this year: Japan’s SLIM lander touched down in January, followed the next month by a lander from U.S. startup Intuitive Machines.The other countries that have sent spacecraft to Earth’s nearest neighbour are the then-Soviet Union and India. The United States is the only country to have landed humans on the moon, starting in 1969.SAMPLING THE MOONUsing a scoop and drill, the Chang’e-6 lander will aim to collect 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of lunar material over two days and bring it back to Earth.The samples will be transferred to a rocket booster atop the lander, which will launch back into space, tag up with another spacecraft in lunar orbit and return, with a landing in China’s Inner Mongolia region expected around June 25.If all goes as planned, the mission will provide China with a pristine record of the moon’s 4.5 billion-year history and yield new clues on the solar system’s formation. It will also allow for an unprecedented comparison between the dark, unexplored region with the moon’s better understood Earth-facing side.A simulation lab for the Chang’e-6 probe will develop and verify sampling strategies and equipment control procedures, China’s official Xinhua news agency said. It will use a full-scale replica of the sampling area based on exploration results on the environment, rock distribution and lunar soil conditions around the landing site.China’s lunar strategy includes its first astronaut landing around 2030 in a programme that counts Russia as a partner. In 2020 China conducted its first lunar sample return mission with Chang’e-5, retrieving samples from the moon’s nearer side.The U.S. Artemis programme envisions a crewed moon landing by late 2026 or later. NASA has partnered with space agencies including those of Canada, Europe and Japan, whose astronauts will join U.S. crews on an Artemis mission.Artemis relies heavily on private companies, including Elon Musk’s SpaceX, whose Starship rocket aims this decade to attempt the first astronaut landing since NASA’s final Apollo mission in 1972.On Saturday Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa cancelled a private mission around the moon he had paid for, which was to have used SpaceX’s Starship, citing schedule uncertainties in the rocket’s development.Boeing and NASA postponed the company’s first crewed launch of Starliner, a long-delayed capsule meant to become the second U.S. space taxi to low-Earth orbit.(Reporting by Liz Lee and Eduardo Baptista in Beijing, Joe Brock in Singapore and Joey Roulette in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Editing by Chris Reese, Richard Chang, William Mallard and Michael Perry)","June 2, 2024 - 16:11"
121,Israel bans UN aid agency UNRWA from operating in Israel,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel passed a law on Monday banning the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA from operating in the country, legislation that could impact its work in war-torn Gaza.The lawmakers who drafted the law cited what they described as the involvement of some UNRWA staffers in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel and staffers having membership in Hamas and other armed groups.The legislation has alarmed the United Nations and some of Israel’s Western allies who fear it would further worsen the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting Hamas militants for a year. The ban does not refer to operations in the Palestinian territories or elsewhere.“UNRWA workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable. Since avoiding a humanitarian crisis is also essential, sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza now and in the future,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on social media after the vote.“In the 90 days before this legislation takes effect – and after – we stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel’s security.”Parliament also passed an addendum to the new law saying that Israeli authorities could no longer have contact with UNRWA, but exceptions to that could be made in the future.The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, called the vote a “dangerous precedent” that opposes the U.N. charter and violates Israel’s obligation under international law.“This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to #Palestine Refugees,” he wrote on social media platform X.UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, employs tens of thousands of workers and provides education, health and aid to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.It has long had tense relations with Israel but ties have deteriorated sharply since the start of the war in Gaza and Israel has called repeatedly for UNRWA to be disbanded, with its responsibilities transferred to other U.N. agencies. The U.N. said in August that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in the Oct. 7 assault and had been fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon – killed last month in an Israeli strike – was found to have had an UNRWA job. Another commander killed in Gaza last week doubled as a U.N. aid worker. UNRWA had confirmed both men had been employees.“If the United Nations is not willing to clean this organization from terrorism, from Hamas activists, then we have to take measures to make sure that they cannot harm our people ever again,” said Israeli lawmaker Sharren Haskel.“The international community could have taken responsibility and made sure that they used the proper organizations to facilitate humanitarian aid, like the World Food Organization, like UNICEF, and many others who work all around the world,” Haskel said.An UNRWA spokesperson said prior to the vote that the proposed law would be a “disaster” and would have a serious impact on the humanitarian operation in Gaza and in the occupied West Bank.“We know that previous attempts that aimed at replacing UNRWA and providing humanitarian assistance have failed miserably,” said Juliette Touma, the main spokesperson for the organisation.“It’s outrageous that a member state of the United Nations is working to dismantle a UN agency which also happens to be the largest responder in the humanitarian operation in Gaza.”The law would likely directly impact UNRWA institutions in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in a move not recognised abroad.Another of the law’s authors, Boaz Bismuth, said UNRWA’s work there has been counterproductive for years. “If you really want stability, if you really want security, if you want real peace in the Middle East, organizations like UNRWA won’t bring you there,” said Bismuth.Israel has faced heavy international pressure to do more to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to get more aid to people displaced by Israel’s campaign. Before the legislation was passed, foreign ministers from France, Germany, Britain, Japan and South Korea, Canada and Australia issued a statement expressing “grave concern.”“It is crucial that UNRWA and other UN organizations and agencies be fully able to deliver humanitarian aid and their assistance to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandates effectively,” the statement said.(Reporting by Dedi Hayoun, Maayan Lubell and Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem; Editing by Leslie Adler and Matthew Lewis)","October 29, 2024 - 18:57"
122,Turkey vs. Zolgensma: the battle over a $2.1 million drug,"Rüzgar has been fighting for his life since the day he was born. At one month old, he was diagnosed with the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disease that causes progressive muscle loss. Without treatment, babies who show symptoms before the age of six months typically don’t survive beyond their second birthday.   As soon as Rüzgar’s parents were told he had the disease, they knew what they had to do – they launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $2.1 million to pay for a gene therapy they believed would save his life: Zolgensma. Although dozens of other countries, including the United States, had already approved the one-time treatment, the Turkish health authorities were holding out, insisting that there was insufficient evidence of the drug’s efficacy to justify its eye-popping price tag and include it on the list of approved medicines.SMA is more prevalent in Turkey than in most other countries because of the high rate of marriage between relatives. Some estimates
External link
suggest that one out of 6,000 babies in Turkey is born with SMA compared with one out of 10,000 globally. At least 3,000 infants and adults live with SMA in the country and around 150 new cases a year are diagnosed, mostly in newborn babies, according to Turkish health ministry estimates
External link
.Turkish parents watched children with SMA in other countries achieve typical baby milestones such as sitting up and eating on their own after receiving the one-time infusion. Desperate to help their own children, hundreds of parents like Rüzgar’s turned to crowdfunding to pay for the therapy, which is unaffordable for most people in a country where the average annual salary is around $32,000.“Images of babies were all over Twitter and Instagram. Campaigns appeared on advertising screens in trams with Iban [bank account] numbers along with photos of babies with SMA. It was very emotional,” said Mine Sanem Özkan, a health technology researcher from Turkey, who wrote her Masters thesis

on the challenges of accessing drugs to treat the disease.Politicians were tagged in parents’ tweets and asked to simply retweet. Some campaigners were able to receive a “like” on Facebook or Instagram from a Turkish actor or football star, helping reach more potential supporters.Families who managed to raise enough money flew to Dubai, Hungary, or the US where their babies could receive the drug. Some patient associations estimate that at least 100 infants went abroad for treatment. Rüzgar was one of them. In September 2020, when he was 14 months old, he and his family travelled to the Children’s Hospital of San Antonio in the US where he received his Zolgensma infusion. A year later, he was able to sit up and stand on his own.However, some children died waiting for families to raise enough money. Others became ineligible for Zolgensma because they had exceeded the age or weight limit for the drug or their muscle loss was too severe.The emotional campaigns caused a public outcry that piled pressure on the Turkish government to make Zolgensma available and for the state-funded Social Security Institution (SSI), which provides free healthcare, to reimburse it. But the government refused to budge.The Ministry of Health had set up a scientific review board in 2020 to assess new treatments for SMA. After a first evaluation of Zolgensma that year, the board concluded that there wasn’t sufficient evidence of the drug’s safety and efficacy to recommend its approval.When the review board reached the same conclusion in 2021, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, who chaired the board, warned families not to organise crowdfunding campaigns for a therapy whose touted benefits were not backed up by evidence. And in 2023, when the board stuck to its position for a third time, Koca reiterated that the government “will not allow our children to be used as guinea pigs”.Zolgensma had been approved on a fast-track timeline in the US and Europe to expedite access for patients with few other treatment options. Fewer than 40 patients had been involved in trials prior to US approval, and although many infants were achieving major motor milestones, there was no data on how long the benefits lasted. “The government never said Zolgensma was too expensive or that it couldn’t afford it,” said Ece Soyer Demir, who founded the first SMA patients association in the country, Turkey SMA Foundation

, in 2017 after her son Çağan was diagnosed with the most severe form of SMA when he was just a few months old. Rather it put the onus on Novartis to provide more evidence.The ministry also disputed claims by some crowdfunding campaigns that SMA sufferers had no alternative treatment options and would die if they did not receive Zolgensma by the age of two.The Turkish authorities had already approved and agreed to reimburse another treatment for SMA, Spinraza, sold by US pharma group Biogen. Although it isn’t a gene therapy and there were initially restrictions on eligibility, evidence showed it slows the disease’s progression.Last March, and again in early 2024, Novartis released more clinical trial results demonstrating Zolgensma’s long-term benefits and safety especially if given before symptoms appear, although studies comparing the different therapies with each other are still lacking.The ministry’s stance on Zolgensma wasn’t just based on a lack of sufficient scientific evidence, it was also highly political, Özkan said. Crowdfunding campaigns raised questions of fairness and equity that split public opinion.Demir said that while some patients access treatment through crowdfunding campaigns, others cannot because they live in remote areas or don’t have the technical know-how to run campaigns. Her son was too old to receive Zolgensma by the time it was approved in the US, but he has been treated with Spinraza. “Fair and accessible treatment for everyone” should be the goal, she said.The health minister consistently defended the government’s position and pointed the finger at pharmaceutical companies. “The main issue here is advocating for global pharmaceutical companies by crossing the boundaries of morality and making our state look incapable,” Koca was quoted

as saying in a press release

in 2021. In 2023, he struck a similar tone, saying

that the government would not “allow the hope of our families to be used for commercial purposes”.Novartis’s marketing approach didn’t help Zolgensma’s cause. Despite the high prevalence of SMA in Turkey, the company didn’t involve Turkish sufferers in any of its clinical trials. Nor did it include Turkey in its early access programme, which provides free doses to some patients in countries where a drug isn’t yet approved.This contrasted with Biogen which, a public official told Özkan, had “played it by the book”. The company had an agreement with Turkey to provide free doses and had conducted clinical trials in the country before Spinraza was approved.Swiss pharma group Roche, whose drug Evrysdi was approved by Turkey for inclusion in the treatment guidelines
External link
for SMA sufferers in 2023, had also included patients from the country in clinical trials. Evrysdi’s list price in the US is $100,000-$340,000 per year depending on the patient’s weight and it must be taken every day for life, in contrast to Zolgensma, which is a one-time intravenous infusion, potentially making Evrysdi a more expensive treatment.A Novartis spokesperson told SWI swissinfo.ch that for reasons of confidentiality, the company couldn’t disclose details of its conversations with the Turkish government, but it regretted that no consensus or agreement had yet been reached with the Turkish health authorities.In an email he said Novartis remained committed to engaging with Turkish health authorities to identify “flexible, sustainable, and affordable access pathways” for the treatment of eligible SMA patients in Turkey.Although Zolgensma still isn’t available in Turkey, publicity generated by the crowdfunding campaigns and the political response has led to positive changes, according to SMA advocates. The government has now included the disease in newborn screening, enabling babies to be diagnosed and given approved treatments before symptoms appear.In 2022, Turkey became one of the few countries to offer carrier screening

for prospective parents. If either parent carries the genetic mutation, the state insurance programme will cover preimplantation genetic diagnosis – a procedure similar to in-vitro fertilisation – to ensure their baby is SMA-free, making treatment unnecessary.“The government has realised that it is much cheaper to prevent this disease than to treat it,” Demir said.Edited by Nerys Avery/vm/ts","April 26, 2024 - 09:00"
123,EU public health body lifts mpox risk alert level,"By Bhanvi Satija and Jennifer Rigby(Reuters) -The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on Friday raised its risk level for mpox, a day after global health officials confirmed the first infection with a new strain of the virus outside Africa, in Sweden.The EU public health body’s head said there will be more imported cases of the new mpox strain in Europe in the coming weeks, though the risk of sustained transmission remains low.The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency, its highest form of alert, following an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighbouring countries.The global health body is due to host an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss ways to ensure fair global access to tests, treatments and vaccines for the virus, a leading official said.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill. Two strains are now spreading in Congo – the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new offshoot called clade Ib.The ECDC on Friday raised its risk level assessment for mpox to “moderate” from “low” for sporadic cases appearing in the EU, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travellers visiting from affected areas. The agency said the overall risk to the population had gone up from “very low” to “low”.“Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported clade I cases,” its director Pamela Rendi Wagner said.Pakistan also confirmed on Friday a case of the mpox virus in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, though it was not clear whether it was of the new variant or of the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022.Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as COVID-19 there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.WHO official Margaret Harris said on a media call on Friday that she expects more cases outside Africa to emerge soon, also as a result of heightened monitoring.However, the WHO has advised against any travel restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. China said earlier on Friday it plans to monitor people and goods entering the country for mpox for the next six months.DIAGNOSTICSFar more diagnostic kits, treatments and vaccines need to be shipped to Africa to respond adequately to the outbreak of the new strain of the mpox virus there, an official of the Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian network said on Friday.The head of global vaccine group Gavi told Reuters it has up to $500 million to spend on getting shots to countries affected by the escalating outbreak in Africa.Shares in companies making and developing products against mpox surged on Friday. Shares of vaccine makers Bavarian Nordic and Emergent BioSolutions jumped 20% each, while those of Siga Technologies, which makes an antiviral mpox drug, rose 7%.Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic said it had submitted data to the EU’s drug regulator for approval to extend the use of its mpox and smallpox vaccine to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.Shares in New Jersey-based Tonix Pharmaceuticals also leapt after the company said it will advance development of its mpox vaccine candidate.“We are motivated to advance development for our mpox vaccine with urgency given the global public health emergency,” its CEO Seth Lederman said.(Reporting by Jennifer Rigby in London, Bhanvi Satija, Puyaan Singh, Mariam Sunny and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru, Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt, Miranda Murray in Berlin, Mushtaq Ali in Peshawar, Charlotte Greenfield in Islamabad, Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen, Lucy Raitano in London; Writing by Jan Harvey; Editing by Catherine Evans and Mark Potter)","August 16, 2024 - 18:58"
124,"No new limits on Ukraine’s use of US arms if North Korea joins Russia’s fight, Pentagon says","By Phil Stewart and Andrew GrayWASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The U.S. will not impose new limits on Ukraine’s use of American weapons if North Korea joins Russia’s war, the Pentagon said on Monday, as NATO said North Korean military units had been deployed to the Kursk region in Russia.The North Korea deployment is fanning Western concerns that the 2-1/2-year conflict in Ukraine could widen, even as attention shifts to the Middle East.It could signal how Russia hopes to offset mounting battlefield losses and continue making slow, steady gains in eastern Ukraine. “The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters after talks with a South Korean delegation about the North Korean deployments.U.S. President Joe Biden said the development was “very dangerous.”The Pentagon estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday.“A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk Oblast near the border with Ukraine,” said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, using a term for a Russian region.The Kremlin had initially dismissed reports about a North Korean deployment as “fake news”. But Putin on Thursday did not deny North Korean troops were in Russia and said it was Moscow’s business how to implement a partnership treaty with Pyongyang.The Russian leader also said over the weekend that Moscow will respond accordingly if the U.S. and its allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia, with Moscow seeing the West’s potential approval as “direct involvement of NATO” into the war.The United States, however, has given no indication that it will approve Ukraine’s deep strike request.A North Korean foreign ministry official did not confirm media reports about a troop deployment to Russia but said if Pyongyang had taken such action, he believed it would be in line with international norms.Ukrainian military intelligence said on Thursday that the first North Korean units had been recorded in the Kursk border region, where Ukrainian troops have been operating since staging a major incursion in August. But the Pentagon declined to confirm that North Korean forces were already in Kursk.“It is likely that they are moving in that direction towards Kursk. But I don’t have more details just yet,” Singh said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the move was an escalation by Russia.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv had been warning about the deployment for weeks, and accused allies of failing to deliver a strong response. “The bottom line: listen to Ukraine. The solution: lift restrictions on our long-range strikes against Russia now,” he said on X. Since their leaders met in Russia’s Far East last year, North Korea and Russia have upgraded their military ties. They met again in June to sign a comprehensive strategic partnership that includes a mutual defense pact.A flurry of bilateral visits of high-ranked officials have followed between the two countries, which share a small piece of border. North Korea’s foreign minister Choe Son Hui departed Pyongyang on Monday for her second trip to Russia in six weeks.Rutte said the the deployment of North Korean troops was a sign of “growing desperation” on Putin’s part, Rutte said. “Over 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in Putin’s war and he is unable to sustain his assault on Ukraine without foreign support,” Rutte said.The Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said sanctions alone would not be a sufficient response to North Korean involvement. He added that Kyiv needs “weapons and a clear plan to prevent North Korea’s expanded involvement”.  “The enemy understands strength. Our allies have this strength,” Yermak said on X.(Reporting by Andrew Gray in Brussels, Phil Stewart in Washington; additional reporting by Yuliia Dysa in Gdansk and Gabriella Borter in New Castle, Delaware, Susan Heavey in Washington, Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Lidia Kelly in Melbourne; editing by Bart Meijer, Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Mark Heinrich, Angus MacSwan, Rod Nickel, David Gregorio and Sonali Paul)","October 28, 2024 - 23:51"
125,S&P 500 Rebound Leaves Big Banks Out on Earnings: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — The stock market saw another week of gains and Treasuries erased their losses for the year after the latest economic data reinforced bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September.About 80% of the shares in the S&P 500 gained on Friday as the measure reclaimed its 5,600 mark after a previous session slide. Smaller firms once again outperformed the megacap space to notch their best week in 2024. In the last 30 minutes of Wall Street trading, stocks pared their advance. Banks got hit at the start of the US earnings season, with results from Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. failing to fuel industry momentum.Equity traders brushed off a weak reading on consumer sentiment to focus on prospects for rate cuts that could ultimately benefit Corporate America. Data also showed producer prices climbed slightly more than forecast — but categories used to calculate the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, were not so bad.“We continue to expect the Fed to join the global rate-cutting cycle in September, with 50 basis points of easing this year,” said Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.The S&P 500 rose to around 5,615 — posting its 10th weekly gain in 12 weeks. Nvidia Corp. led gains in tech. Tesla Inc. rallied a day after tumbling over 8%. Meta Platforms Inc. slid 2.7%.Wells Fargo sank 6% as the lender’s results were marred by higher-than-expected costs. JPMorgan missed on a few key metrics like net interest income — despite posting a record profit. Citigroup said costs for the year are likely to be at the high end of the range previously provided. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. jumped on better-than-expected NII.Treasury 10-year yields declined three basis points to 4.18%. Swap traders have fully priced in a quarter-point Fed cut in September and are targeting more than two reductions this year.“A critical risk, however, lies in financial conditions loosening — a development that is already contributing to our real-time tracking measures pointing to July inflation of 0.3% m/m for headline and core,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “A continuation of these developments, which is my base case, will deter the Fed from dishing out its first cut of the cycle in September.”To Krishna Guha at Evercore, the latest PPI release confirms June inflation is set to print very mild in the mid-teens month-on-month on the Fed’s preferred core PCE measure — putting US officials firmly on track to cut in September.He also says this “new Fed phase” may sustain the stock-market breadth.“We are now entering a new phase in which preemptive cuts (as opposed to reactive cuts driven by bigger rises in unemployment) can de-risk the forward growth outlook,” he noted. “Provided the Fed is not moving too slowly to arrest the underlying weakening of the economy, this de-risking of the forward growth outlook favors market breadth and cyclical sectors.”One of the biggest questions about the market action in the previous session — which notably improved breadth — is whether or not it is a legitimate trend reversal of the last year and half — or yet another head fake, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.“We will say at the outset that as far as the technicals are concerned, it cannot be confirmed that yesterday’s action was the beginning of a sustainable longer-term trend,” he noted. “However, from a trading perspective, we do believe we can continue to see further rotation over the near term, as charts still point to the potential for mean reversion.”One thing to keep in mind is that a “rotational” move is not the same as a “broadening out” move, according to Matt Maley at Miller Tabak.“We believe a ‘rotational’ move will do the exact opposite of what it did when investors were ‘rotating’ into the tech sector in a big way over the past 20 months: It will drag the entire market lower with it — just like it has dragged the rest of the market higher with it since the fall of 2022,” he noted.A highlight of this week was the big rebound in smaller firms — which have largely lagged the broader market and especially big techs this year.Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial says the Russell 2000 is viewed as an important barometer of potential interest-rate easing, but also a gauge for economic conditions. “Historically, the Russell 2000 lags the market for three months following the first rate cut. The Fed normally cuts rates due to concerns about the economy and specifically the labor market,” Krosby noted. “The market would much prefer a rate cut predicated on inflation easing amid a solid economic landscape.”The next few economic data points, in addition to earnings reports, should help clarify if small-cap performance is completely warranted, she concluded.“Bulls withstood a barrage of data this week,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “Market momentum remains relentless. Several important hurdles have been cleared, making earnings the next likely market catalyst.”Corporate Highlights:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Cecile Gutscher.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","July 12, 2024 - 23:26"
126,"No urgency for ECB to speed up policy easing, Wunsch says","By Balazs Koranyi(Reuters) – There is no urgency for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates quicker and it could even live with a small, temporary undershoot of its inflation target, Belgian central bank chief Pierre Wunsch said, joining colleagues in pushing back on more dovish views.ECB policymakers have expressed widely different views on prices and policy in recent days, with some worried about inflation falling below 2% and forcing the ECB to act quickly, even as others said risks were more balanced, so the bank should keep moving with extreme care.“Employment is high, real wages are rising and a soft landing is still the most likely outcome, so there is no urgency in further accelerating the easing of monetary policy,” Wunsch told Reuters in an interview.The comments come after Portuguese central bank chief Mario Centeno said that a 50 basis point rate cut should be among options on the table in December and Italy’s Fabio Panetta said it was not clear the ECB could stop rate cuts when it gets to a neutral level, where it no longer holds back growth.Markets currently price a 35 basis point rate cut for Dec. 12, indicating that investors see a 40% chance the ECB moves by 50 basis points after three 25 basis point cuts this year.Wunsch agreed that inflation could fall back to the ECB’s target by mid-2025, ahead of projections for late in the year, but there was no great risk of a sustained dip below 2%.A quicker inflation fall would warrant further rate cuts but this should remain gradual until restriction on the economy is removed.Wunsch also argued that the ECB normally looks past inflation swings caused by temporary volatility in energy prices and it should be truly symmetric in its approach by looking past energy costs swings in both directions.“If the economy is holding up, performing at its potential but we are temporarily undershooting because of a positive terms of trade shock, I’m OK with that and we shouldn’t overdramatize such an event,” he said. “Being a bit below 2% is not a big event if the medium term continues to point to 2%.”Wunsch also said that underlying inflation, which filters out energy costs, may be a better indicator of how much the ECB is restricting the economy since it gave a better indication on wage pressures, especially in services, the largest group in the consumer price basket.“I would argue that underlying inflation data rather than headline may give us a better indication on how restrictive policy is,” Wunsch said.Wunsch also cautioned against jumping the gun on December, since big events and data releases in the coming weeks will have oversized implications for the economy.“We’ll have so much information until then, including two more inflation readings and new staff projections,” he said. “There will be a U.S. election, and we also need to see how the conflict in the Middle East develops, so discussing precise levels is premature.”","October 28, 2024 - 07:04"
127,Swiss consumer brands chase their China dream,"In August 2019, Aurèle Meyer found himself at the upscale whisky bar Jiuyin in Hangzhou, the home of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The CEO of Brauerei Locher, a Swiss family-owned drinks company, was on a tour of China, visiting business partners and potential distributors for its beer and whisky.Over a drink with colleagues, Meyer had a light-bulb moment: get niche Swiss whisky into high-end bars and restaurants. Fast forward to today and Brauerei Locher’s Säntis Malt Whisky is the first and only Swiss whisky served across the Jiuyin hospitality group’s eight upmarket bars in the capital of Zhejiang province.“Swiss products have a strong reputation in China especially in top-tier cities such as Shanghai and Beijing,” says Meyer. “However, Swiss beer and whisky still remain largely unknown. We wanted to change that.”The independent brewery is one of many Swiss consumer companies – including premium chocolate maker Läderach – striving to capture a slice of the vast Chinese market.Before the global pandemic, China’s attraction was clear: a population of 1.4 billion; annual economic growth averaging around 7.7% from 2010 to 2019 – compared with 1.7% for Switzerland; rising household incomes; a middle class that had grown from 7.4 million to 400 million in almost two decades and forecast by the Boston Consulting Group to reach 525 million in 2030.But almost three years of stringent controls and lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a sea change in consumer behaviour and sentiment. After a brief spurt of revenge spending when the country re-opened at the end of 2022, there has been a noticeable divergence, with consumption of goods remaining lacklustre while spending on travel, tourism, and leisure has powered ahead.“We have seen a shift from products to services with travel and foodservice showing strongest growth,” says Daniel Zipser, senior partner at consultancy group McKinsey who leads the firm’s consumer and retail work in Asia. “After years of restricted mobility, there’s renewed enthusiasm for travel and socialising in restaurants and bars.”Against this backdrop, consumer-focused businesses with high-quality products and premium branding will be among the most successful, according to a McKinsey report released in November 2023 titled “China Consumption: Start of a New Era”. That’s good news for Swiss companies such as Läderach and Brauerei Locher that target affluent consumers with greater spending power. “Higher-income earners are still spending more, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2019,” says Zipser. “They are more careful in where and on what they spend.”China’s GDP expanded by 5.2% in 2023, the weakest pace since 1999, excluding the three pandemic years of 2020-2022, and growth is expected to slow further in 2024 to 4.6%, according to the International Monetary Fund. But the subdued outlook has not dampened the ambitions of Brauerei Locher. The company – which employs around 200 people – is run by the fifth generation of the Locher family and focuses primarily on beer and whisky. It took its first steps into the China market in 2019  – just before the global pandemic brought many consumer-facing businesses to a standstill.With China now fully open, Meyer is picking up where he left off. The company’s products can be found across major cities from Beijing in the north to Guangzhou in the south. In Shanghai alone, Appenzeller Bier as well as Santis Malt Whisky, one if its landmark drinks, is available in more than 60 restaurants and whisky bars. In Beijing, its products are present in five-star hotels such as Regent, St. Regis, InterContinental Beijing Sanlitun, and Mandarin Oriental. Brauerei Locher products can also be found on the popular Chinese internet shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall.The company started out by participating in consumer product expos to gauge Chinese appetite for its classic and specialty beers. “It was interesting to see which flavours were being picked up,” says Meyer. “For example, our non-alcoholic Bschorle with apple and pear juice is very popular there. Another product is our Säntis Malt ‘Edition Dreifaltigkeit’ whisky with peated malt. It is very heavy and strong and is really popular in China.”Surprisingly, the company’s signature lager – the Quöllfrisch – did not take off in China. “There are already very good Belgian and American craft beers on the market in China that are setting the standard. We can show our high-quality Swiss beer with good ingredients such as Swiss Alps spring water.”China is the world’s biggest beer market, with annual consumption at 42 million kilolitres in 2022, 22% of the world total, according to Japanese drinks group Kirin’s Global Beer Consumption Report. The United States was in second place with 20.4 million kilolitres. However, China doesn’t even rank in the top 35 when it comes to per capita consumption, leaving plenty of room for growth. Even so, capturing a share of the Chinese beer market is challenging even for the major European brands such as AB InBev and Carlsberg, amid increasingly fierce competition from local players such as China Resources Holdings, which owns the Snow Beer brand, and Tsingtao Brewery.      “The preference for local elements (i.e., Cultural Pride) is strong in China, especially from Gen Z consumers. However, this doesn’t mean foreign brands are not attractive anymore,” says Michael Deng, lead partner of consumer products and retail sector at Deloitte Consulting China. “As long as foreign brands can ride on the trend of localization and/or co-branding with Chinese brands and have more China for China products, they can still be very successful in the China market.”For small international players such as Brauerei Locher, building a brand in an already saturated market is tough. The company’s expansion strategy is therefore one of “slow but sustainable” growth.“On the one hand, we have a long-term approach as a family-owned company. On the other hand, we don’t have a marketing budget of CHF10 million to develop a market,” says Meyer. “Our production capacities are also limited. As long as we still see growth potential in Switzerland, it doesn’t make sense to invest too many resources in foreign countries in one go.”Läderach is another Swiss company making a play for the Chinese market. Founded in 1962, the family-owned business specialises in luxury chocolate and employs 1,700 people worldwide. It began selling online in China in 2020 after receiving a growing number of requests from Chinese tourists who had tasted its chocolate in Switzerland and wanted to buy it back home. In 2021, in the depths of the Covid pandemic, Läderach opened its first retail store in Shanghai. “Strategically, China is an important market for the group. It is among the three biggest markets for us including the United States and Switzerland,” says Danny Qi, general manager of Läderach China. Consumer preferences are fairly similar, he said. “Our best-selling product in Switzerland is FrischSchoggi or fresh chocolate… and consumers here responded almost the same to our product line, as they do in Switzerland.”Läderach opened its sixteenth boutique in the country at the end of January. The megacities of Beijing and Shanghai remain the most important markets, but the company is also expanding into smaller cities such as Wuxi and Nanjing in the more affluent eastern part of the country and Chengdu, the capital of southwest Sichuan province. “Doubling the number of stores in China in the next five years is not impossible,” says Qi. Currently, Läderach has around 170 boutiques worldwide. “We have to open a store one-by-one in order to know whether our strategy is working,” he adds.Although it’s the world’s second most-populous nation, China’s per capita consumption of chocolate still lags behind European countries. Data from Statista Market Insights show that the average annual consumption in China per head is 200 grams compared with 11.8 kilograms in Switzerland. According to Euromonitor International, the entire chocolate market in China is worth about €3.1 billion (CHF2.9 billion) a year. In contrast, annual sales in Switzerland reached nearly CHF1.79 billion (€1.93 billion) before the pandemic, according to the Association of Swiss Chocolate Manufacturers.However, chocolate is becoming more popular in China, especially as a luxury gift. “It is a growing market, especially in the premium chocolate sector,” says Qi. “People in China are willing to pay more for good food. That’s where the opportunity is.”Looking ahead, Läderach continues to face competition from other premium chocolate brands such as the Italian manufacturer Ferrero and Belgium-based Godiva Chocolatier. However, the company is also competing with other segments of the gifting business in China. This is especially evident during major shopping occasions such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and Chinese New Year.After an unexpectedly subdued 2023 following China’s post-pandemic reopening, foreign and domestic companies are watching closely for signs that the country’s economic recovery is gathering momentum.“Cautious optimism is still very much present, with China’s economy steadily evolving towards being more consumption-driven,” says Mckinsey’s Zipser on the outlook for 2024. “While recovery may be slower than anticipated and low consumer sentiment could dampen growth rates in the coming months, the long-term prospects of the Chinese market remain robust.”Other experts are more circumspect. “I personally believe the consumption recovery in 2024 will be dependent on the geopolitical relationship with the US, Chinese government stimulus policies, and consumer confidence,” says Deng from Deloitte Consulting China.Even so, Meyer remains positive and is sticking with his mission for Brauerei Locher for the next decade. “In the end, it’s all about building a sustainable reputation with stable clients,” he says. “Our goal is to travel to China and stay in a hotel and dine at a restaurant where they serve our products. Then I will always be able to get a taste of home.”Edited by Nerys Avery/vm","February 8, 2024 - 09:00"
128,"All bee colonies in Switzerland are sick, warns specialist","Swiss bees are infected by the varroa mite, Neumann explained in an interview published on Friday by the CH Media group of newspapers. “There are other viruses that have nothing to do directly with the mite. On the whole, colonies are so weakened that even viruses that would not normally be harmful become a threat”.According to the expert, three measures should be put in place to improve the situation: better information for beekeepers and the general public, the development of protection measures for all bees and honeybees, and finally extensive research into a sustainable strategy against varroa mites. Moreover, the mite must be fought sustainably, Neumann adds. “It’s crazy that we’ve been at the same point for 30 years.”Neumann also calls for a ban on the use of insecticides and pesticides. “There are frightening data on this subject. It almost took my breath away recently […] I’m surprised we still have insects”.The specialist refutes the idea that there are too many honeybees in cities. “That’s a bit like saying that there are too many cows in Switzerland because they eat the grass of deer and rabbits. The density of honeybees in Switzerland is still lower than in Africa, where bees occur naturally in the wild,” he says.First and foremost, bees need to become healthier again, he points out. “This will also reduce the likelihood of infection by other viruses.","September 22, 2023 - 09:34"
129,"‘We’ll take the time we need’ with EU negotiations, says top Swiss trade diplomat","SWI swissinfo.ch: Swiss emigrants like Louis Chevrolet and César Ritz once laid the foundations for iconic brands. Do you see such figures today?Helene Budliger Artieda: Yes, there are outstanding Swiss entrepreneurs all over the world, especially in small businesses. In many countries where I have lived, there has been a very successful Swiss butcher or Swiss baker. In some cases, they became very rich through new, high-quality products.In Thailand, for example, I met two young entrepreneurs who built toilet facilities. This is not necessarily what you would expect from a Swiss company, but they are very successful.In South Africa, I met ETH Zurich graduates who have created a market with innovative house construction materials that are geared to the local climate. They are not targeting the luxury sector, nor the social sector, but the lower-middle class. This class falls through the cracks in South Africa, and many cannot afford their own home. Who knows what might become of these names?SWI: Do you recognise a pattern, something typically Swiss, when you see Swiss companies abroad?H.B.A.: Yes, they are at the forefront in terms of quality or innovation, often both. Switzerland generally has to compete on the basis of quality and innovation, because we can’t score points on price or mass production.Another typically Swiss trait is that we insure ourselves on all possible sides. To a certain extent, this also applies to companies. In these volatile times, it is an advantage that our companies act with great foresight and are correspondingly resilient. We saw this during the pandemic and then also in the aftermath of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Swiss companies consistently demonstrate impressive resilience.SWI: Because they are economical with reserves?H.B.A.: Or simply because they have good instincts for risks and opportunities, perhaps also for avoiding risk altogether. What is also striking is that, as a rule, Swiss entrepreneurs are very close to their businesses.SWI: What do you mean by that?H.B.A.: I am impressed by their affinity with their employees. Of course, Swiss entrepreneurs also want to earn money. Nevertheless, there is a high degree of understanding that they work in society and for society. They know what duty of care means for a company.SWI: Switzerland is currently supporting companies entering the Ukrainian market and CHF500 million ($562 million) has been reallocated from development aid for this purpose. Are there enough companies to shoulder this volume?H.B.A.: Absolutely. There are some Swiss companies that have been operating in Ukraine for years and have held out during the war. One very important example is a window manufacturer that has remained in Ukraine. If you can install their safety glass in hospitals or kindergartens, that’s very meaningful.There is also a construction company that can fulfil the great need for protective bunkers in Ukraine. A project is already underway in which we are supporting a company that installs train tracks. Ukraine is a major grain supplier, and transport by rail is becoming increasingly important due to the difficult situation around the ports.SWI: So the main beneficiaries will be the companies that have held out in Ukraine?H.B.A.: No, for a second phase, and if Ukraine is interested, we are also considering a general expansion of Swiss deliveries. The legal framework still needs to be established for that. Since it has become known that we are developing an instrument geared towards Swiss businesses, domestic companies are also bringing new ideas to the table. An economic mission is planned for the end of the year, on which we will take these companies with us, and there is a lot of interest in this.SWI: So, contrary to some critics, you have no problem with development aid money being diverted into Swiss economic development?H.B.A.: It’s not the aim to create jobs in Switzerland. The important thing is that the CHF500 million has a development component. This project will therefore not hugely differ from our previous economic development cooperation projects. We are used to taking great care to ensure that we create framework conditions that lead to local jobs. The added value should happen locally wherever possible.We also have to recognise the overarching issue, that a lot of money will be flowing into Ukraine in the near future, an amount the authorities there will hardly have the capacity to absorb meaningfully. I am therefore convinced that the CHF500 million that we will deploy in collaboration with the companies will have a real impact. And to ensure sustainability, a company will remain on site once the restructuring programmes have been completed.SWI: What makes them so secure?H.B.A.: The threshold is market entry. Once this has been achieved, most of them stay. But it is also clear that a company will not go to Ukraine on its own initiative at the moment. However, if they have insurance, it’s a different story. What we now offer is a kind of insurance, not in the traditional form, but in the form of a commission.SWI: Let’s reverse the perspective: how attractive is Switzerland as a business location for foreign companies?H.B.A.: It is attractive, but I always tell ministers abroad that we can also build production centres in their countries. After all, where in Switzerland would we be able to open another large industrial park, for example? We lack land, we lack people. The Swiss population is feeling the pressure of congestion. Never have we been stuck in traffic jams for as long as we are today.SWI: So does Switzerland no longer need foreign companies?H.B.A.: You know that we have full employment in Switzerland. We are only interested in companies that produce high-quality products, are innovative and create good jobs. In short, companies that bring added value to the Swiss economy. If someone else comes along and opens a nail salon, for example, that doesn’t bother me. We’re a free country. But it’s not what will help us strategically. What we don’t want, on the other hand, are letterbox companies [where the general and financial management and the company’s operations are located in a different jurisdiction to that of the company’s legal registration].SWI: The EU dossier has been unresolved for years, even though it is of great importance to the Swiss economy. You have played a central role in Switzerland since 2022 and are now regarded as the most dedicated figure in this dossier…H.B.A.: That’s an exaggeration – our chief negotiator Patric Franzen, for example, is doing a fantastic job. He works day and night on this dossier. There are dedicated people across many departments working to ensure that negotiations with the EU lead to a positive outcome.SWI: But someone has to do the hard graft at home – and that’s you.H.B.A.: Yes, but I’m not doing that alone either. SECO has a role to play in various processes, which we are happy to take on and are also committed to.SWI: Are you getting anywhere? With the trade unions, for example?H.B.A.: We are talking about the social partners, because the employers are also involved. The process is going well, but it’s very complex. We want to provide the negotiators with the best possible arguments and try to play a positive role in the negotiation process. We are therefore looking at what we need to achieve domestically in terms of compensation measures so that we remain within the landing zones agreed with Brussels.SWI: Does Switzerland have enough time for these domestic negotiations?H.B.A.: What do you mean by time?SWI: The time that the social partners need to find a domestic political solution. There has been no progress domestically for years – and Brussels is exerting external pressure.H.B.A.: Yes, there is a certain amount of pressure. Although in the case of Horizon, our shrewd negotiations have for the moment led to some initial relief, but we have not yet reached our goal. In the medtech sector, Swiss companies have higher administrative expenses and costs because mutual recognition no longer works despite equivalent legislation. Conversely, EU manufacturers are no longer supplying certain products to Switzerland due to comparable costs. Rapid progress is therefore also in Switzerland’s interest. At the same time, talks with social partners are continuing at pace.SWI: So the roadmap for a new agreement with the EU is in place?H.B.A.: The government’s premise is that we will take the time that we need. Time pressure is the number one trap in any negotiation. The deadline must not be more important than the quality of the result. Our interests are at stake, not just wage protection, but also other things such as immigration, which is a sensitive issue for us.Edited by Reto Gysi.

130,Inside Europe’s drive to get ammunition to Ukraine as Russia advances,"By Anthony Deutsch and Jan LopatkaSTERNBERK, Czech Republic (Reuters) – Hundreds of Czechs and a handful of Ukrainians are working round the clock in eastern Czech Republic to transform a collection of buildings dating back to World War Two into a hub for supplying arms and ammunition to Ukraine.The initiative is part of Europe’s efforts to provide Kyiv with weapons to repel Russian forces after the stalling of U.S. military aid, which has been the backbone of international support.Visiting the Sternberk facility owned by Czech private arms manufacturer Excalibur Army, General Onno Eichelsheim, head of the Dutch military, described the urgency of the situation as Kyiv’s losses mount in eastern and southern Ukraine.“We have to speed it up. We have to deliver more and we have to do it faster,” he told Reuters during the recent trip to inspect self-propelled howitzer cannons and a refurbished Russian tank to be sent into battle.The most pressing need for Ukraine two years after Russia’s full-scale invasion is artillery ammunition, which is running low as the sides use heavy cannon fire to hold largely static, entrenched positions along the 1,000-km (620-mile) front line.The European Union, which with other Western allies wants to contain Russian advances and repel an increasingly assertive rival, launched an initiative in March 2023 to deliver 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine within 12 months.A year later, it had delivered little more than half that number, officials said, because of insufficient production capacity and a lack of long-term orders.“CLEARING HOUSE”The Czech government has played a central role in trying to raise funding among partners, and in working out deals with the Czech defence industry.The Netherlands has also been “quite busy for a few months in several countries” trying to make up the shortfall in artillery rounds, said Colonel Simon Wouda, chief of the Netherlands’ Ukraine Taskforce.“The first batch should be ready within four months, and that is a very conservative calculation. The second part can certainly be delivered in the second half of this year,” Wouda said, detailing the timeline of supplies for the first time.He said efforts were under way to secure additional contracts with Excalibur Army – which is part of the privately held Czechoslovak Group (CSG) – to purchase 155 mm rounds, which fit artillery guns the Dutch are providing.The Czechoslovak Group acts as manufacturer and munitions clearing house – making air defence systems and vehicles, and sourcing tanks, artillery and shells from around the world and revamping them for Ukraine.Western European countries and other allies pay for much of the materiel. Ukraine also buys military equipment and ammunition directly from partners. The Netherlands has been working with the Czech Republic to find as many 155-mm artillery rounds as possible for Ukraine.Wouda wants to guarantee a steady supply of ammunition as part of a security deal detailed by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The Netherlands and other countries will fund about 800,000 artillery shells being sourced through the Czech Republic.AMMUNITION PRICES SPIKECoalition members funding the short-term purchases include Britain, Canada, Denmark, the Czech Republic and the United States, among others, Wouda told Reuters.“Collectively we have actually found opportunities around the world to find ammunition in other places, outside of Europe,” he said, declining to identify those places. In the two years since Russia’s full-scale invasion, much of Ukraine’s ammunition from overseas has been sourced to U.S. stocks. Western producers have increased production to meet the unexpected surge in demand and the European Commission, the EU executive, expects annual EU-wide shell production to reach 1.4 million by the end of 2024. It was around 500,000 a year ago.For every shell Ukraine fires along the front lines, Russia fires between five or six, officials and defence analysts say. This imbalance restricts Ukraine’s ability to suppress Russian attacks and provide cover for its own troop movements.Russia has increased weapons production and can maintain a much higher rate of fire than Ukraine, but Western experts say Moscow also faces some constraints and has turned to North Korea to bolster its munitions supplies.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told EU foreign ministers last week that Ukraine needed 2.5 million artillery shells this year, according to the Financial Times – suggesting a daily requirement of 7,000 – but the EU had sent only 400,000.Supplies of ammunition to Ukraine have been interrupted by politics, with U.S. Congress holding up a $60 billion military aid package and European powers divided about using EU funds to purchase munitions outside the bloc.There are about 2 million large calibre ammunition rounds available on the global market, a senior Czech official said.Demand from the Ukraine war has driven up prices to $2,800-3,200 per round from $700-$1,200 beforehand, two sources familiar with the market said.CHALLENGESAmmunition supplies to Kyiv must be ramped up if it is to have a chance of turning the tide of the war, analysts Franz-Stefan Gady and Michael Kofman wrote in a February research paper for the International Institute for Strategic Studies.“For supporting countries, the challenge is to significantly increase production of artillery ammunition and air-defence interceptors,” it said. “Kyiv needs around 75,000–90,000 artillery shells per month to sustain the war defensively, and more than double that – 200,000–250,000 – for a major offensive.” Where to source the ammunition is being debated within the EU.The Netherlands has allocated 250 million euros ($271 million) for ammunition purchases for Kyiv, including non-European stocks through the Czech defence industry, and asked allies to contribute to the plan being implemented with the Czech government. The senior Czech official said donor countries can choose from a list of offers of various types of products and origin, with several Czech companies operating as a “clearing house”.With European ammunition sold out for two years, the official questioned why there would be any hesitation to go beyond local markets.France and Germany are considering joining the initiative. French President Emmanuel Macron backed the plan during a visit to Prague on Tuesday and opened the door to using European funds for it, but did not say what Paris would contribute to it.France has also invited foreign and defence ministers from Ukraine’s main allies and the NATO Secretary General to take part in video call on Thursday aimed at showing a “united front” and coming up with concrete proposals to boost support for Kyiv.The invitation said the meeting would look at ways of speeding up delivery of artillery ammunition supply and production.NOT ONLY AMMUNITIONUkraine’s needs extend beyond artillery ammunition. It wants to bolster its air defences and needs more hardware along front lines to match Russia’s superior resources. South Korea and Turkey are among countries supplying Ukraine so far.Later this year, U.S. F-16 fighters are expected to be delivered to Ukraine from Denmark and the Netherlands. The Dutch are also part of a group providing advanced drones capable of attacking deeper into Russian-held territory.The Netherlands has already received 100 mounted anti-aircraft guns and 45 refurbished T-72 tanks for Ukraine from Excalibur Army, among 105 funded with the U.S. and Denmark.It has ordered nine modern howitzer cannon systems. Another Czech supplier, radar technology company ERA, is delivering four long-range surveillance systems, also donated by the Dutch.Pavel Doško, business development director at CSG’s Defence Land Systems, said hundreds of workers had been added to increase production at the Sternberk site.“Together with the Dutch partners and other partners that we have in NATO, we are able to supply Ukraine now with quite a lot of materiel that they desperately need in their defence,” he said in an interview.Standing near a construction site where cement floors had recently been poured and a frame of steel beams built, he said: “We’re doing what we can to supply as much as possible, as good as possible and as fast as possible.”($1 = 0.9211 euros)","March 6, 2024 - 11:03"
131,Looming disaster: one of Switzerland’s last weaving mills faces closure,"“It makes no sense to keep on like this. We don’t want to prolong the agony of Valposchiavo Weaving Mill,” declare Adriana Zanoli and Kaspar Howald, two members of the committee which took over the reins of the cooperative in Graubünden, eastern Switzerland, in 2021 in an attempt to redress its fortunes. In January they gave up the attempt. This was a decision long pondered, though it has caused widespread dismay in the Italian-speaking Alpine valley. “The trouble with the weaving mill is structural,” explains Howald, the chair of the group. “It’s too small to have a professional management concerned with producing the goods for sale and marketing them. Without that, however, there can be no growth and it will just keep teetering on the verge of closure.”For years, in fact, the weaving mill has been in the red, and all its financial reserves, used to make up for deficits, are just about exhausted. To steer clear of bankruptcy, the committee has proposed to the members of the co-op to start closing down the business in stages. It looks like getting the Valposchiavo Weaving Mill back on its feet would take nothing short of a miracle.The Valposchiavo Weaving Mill started as a cooperative in 1955 on the initiative of the Poschiavo branch of Pro Grigioni Italiano (PGI), the Italian-speaking community organisation in Graubünden.It had two main goals. On the one hand, it was to do something about the issue of emigration. It would offer an alternative to young women who otherwise had to leave the valley to look for work in the German-speaking part of the country to the north. On the other hand, the PGI wanted to keep up the tradition of hand-weaving, which was slowly dying out. For that reason, as well as the workshop and the sales outlet, they opened a trade school. Since it was founded, this training arm has given some 20 apprentices the opportunity to qualify for the Swiss federal diploma in textile design. In an interview published in the Almanacco del Grigioni italiano

, Letizia Pedrussio-Gisep, who was head of the school for over 40 years, said that in addition to those stated aims, the weaving mill had a further goal: to keep the young women in the valley so they could marry local farmers, start a family and become “the angel of the fireside” who would weave during the long winters. Despite all the efforts, the population drain to Swiss economic centres has never really stopped. But the textile art was preserved and promoted. Along with the Tessanda

in Val Müstair, Valposchiavo Weaving Mill is one of the last professional craft weaving firms in Switzerland. For upwards of 70 years it has promoted the local cultural heritage. It has produced niche products using natural materials such as silk, wool, cotton, cashmere, linen and hemp.After overcoming several crises and striking a balance between customer demand and profitability in small-scale production, the Valposchiavo Weaving Mill is now facing closure at the very moment when textile production in Europe and particularly in the Alpine region is enjoying a revival.“This would be a terrible cultural loss,” says Cordula Seger, head of the Graubünden Institute for Cultural Research

. “If we fail to keep up our traditions, we lose the connection to our history and our identity, breaking a precious link with our past that has existed from generation to generation.” Diego Rinallo, associate professor of marketing at Emlyon Business School in France, points to another basic aspect. “This kind of traditional craft is a matter of manual skill and learning by doing, which would be almost impossible to document on paper,” he says. “This is know-how that could just disappear.” Not far as the crow flies, the Tessanda in Santa Maria

, Val Müstair, the oldest weaving mill in Switzerland, founded in 1928, has had its times of crisis too. Since 2019, with the help of a marketing expert from Zurich, it has embraced a change of strategy. Currently the Tessanda employs 18 people and to mark its upcoming centenary it is going to move into new premises designed by famous Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. The firm racked up another success in January, when its “Marius” barbecuing apron won a gold medal at the European Textile & Craft Awards 2024

.“Since 2000 there has been a growing awareness of the regional product, including in the textile sector,” says Rinallo, who heads the Lifestyle Research Center at Emlyon Business School. He believes that for some groups in society there is a paradigm shift going on in reaction to fast fashion and the throwaway culture.“We’re seeing a greater demand for regional products,” Seger agrees. “Some people feel disoriented by globalisation and are trying to find themselves again, such as in their cultural heritage.” According to Rinallo, anyone who buys a five-franc T-shirt has to be aware that they are contributing to a chain of human exploitation and environmental destruction. Yet craft products are not within the economic reach of every buyer. Marketing these requires identifying particular consumer segments mostly found in the major urban centres.“The difference in price can be justified only by revealing the process of creation,” says Rinallo. “For example, the Tessanda apron comes with authentic stories of passion, tradition and age-old knowledge.” Besides, the origin of these products in the Alpine region evokes a very positive and reassuring feeling in people, associated with closeness to nature and wellbeing – and of cows grazing contentedly in lovely landscapes. Those grazing herds were the inspiration for the AlpTextyles

project, which aims to promote the cultural heritage of textiles in the Alps and revive the woollen business.  Started in November 2022 as an offshoot of the Interreg Alpine Space programme, the project gets European, federal and cantonal funding and brings together 12 partner organisations. Among these are trade associations, representing the textile industry, public-sector agencies, research centres, universities, museums and local governments in Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany, France and Slovenia.  “The Alpine cultural heritage has a key role in re-establishing the value chains in textiles, which were disrupted by globalisation,” explains Cassiano Luminati, head of the Polo Poschiavo, a local skills centre which facilitates development projects. “Currently, wool is classified as a ‘special waste’. The aim of AlpTextyles is to revive the woollen business, supporting existing structures, linking them in networks, promoting regional development, circularity, sustainability, innovation and preserving the intangible heritage.”  This project is holding out some hope of survival for the Valposchiavo Weaving Mill. “I often dream of our looms being involved in working for the great European fashion houses, in a perfect union of tradition and innovation,” sighs Adriana Zanoli.But for a fragile business like the Valposchiavo Weaving Mill, time for dreaming is running out. Concrete practical solutions are needed in the short term. Otherwise the age-old harmonious dance between the weaver and the loom, characterised by rhythmic movements of bare feet on the treadles, vigorous strokes with the comb and quick movements of the shuttle between the threads of warp and weft is likely to come to an end in the Poschiavo Valley, this time for good.

133,UBS rules out external successor to chief Sergio Ermotti,"Check out our selection of newsletters. Subscribe here.The Swiss bank could signal the identities of the potential successors as early as next year’s annual meeting, according to people with knowledge of the plans, having decided against looking outside the group for a future leader.The candidates, who are expected to be drawn from the current executive board, would then be given additional responsibilities or changes to their roles in order to broaden their experience ahead of potentially replacing Ermotti.“It’s about giving them a greater purview,” said a person with knowledge of the plans. “They will need time to prove themselves.” Ermotti returned to UBS as chief executive just over a year ago within days of the bank rescuing its arch-rival Credit Suisse, in a shotgun marriage arranged by the Swiss authorities.At the time, the 64-year-old former investment banker committed to spending three to five years in the role, according to people briefed on the agreement, in order to oversee the three-year integration of Credit Suisse and develop a growth strategy for the combined group. Ermotti has also been charged with nurturing a pool of successors.UBS chair Colm Kelleher fired the starting pistol on the succession race last year when he said the bank was looking to follow the example set by his former employer, Morgan Stanley, at the Financial Times’s Banking Summit.Morgan Stanley had several internal candidates to choose from when longtime chief executive James Gorman stepped down last year. They eventually settled on Ted Pick. Gorman announced on Thursday that he would leave his position as chair at the end of 2024.But UBS’s organisational structure is different to Morgan Stanley’s, which allowed Pick and another candidate, Andy Saperstein, to share responsibility for much of the group in co-president roles.At UBS, divisional heads sit on the group executive board and report directly to the chief executive. In order to prepare potential successors better, UBS’s board had considered tweaking the structure or changing executives’ roles, according to people briefed on the discussions.Though no final decision has been made about who would make the shortlist, Iqbal Khan, head of wealth management — UBS’s most important division — is expected to be included.Rob Karofsky, head of the investment bank, is viewed as another potential contender, as is Bea Martin, who oversees UBS’s non-core and legacy unit, which is responsible for disposing and winding down parts of Credit Suisse that are deemed undesirable. She was recently given additional oversight of sustainability.Sabine Keller-Busse, who runs UBS’s Swiss business, is also seen as a potential candidate.While succession plans have been mapped out by UBS’s board, the management team is preoccupied with integrating the two businesses, including merging the legal entities by the end of May.Ermotti is also focused on dealing with Swiss authorities over incoming rules that could include additional capital requirements on UBS, which the bank is pushing against.UBS declined to comment.Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024© 2024 The Financial Times Ltd.

134,The good wife: Nepali migrants’ wives struggle to fill in for husbands and the state,"It’s been a little over six months since Suntali Tamang became a widow. Her husband Tirtha Bahadur Tamang left home in 2021 to work as a labourer in Qatar. Less than a year later he fell ill and had to be hospitalised. A migrants’ organisation, the Pravasi Nepal Coordination Committee, helped bring him back to Nepal, but he never made it to his village of Padaali in Dhulikhel municipality, just a couple of hours away from the capital by bus or shared taxi. Tirtha Bahadur died a week after being admitted to a hospital in Kathmandu.  “He could not come home and see the house he helped build,” says Suntali.  Their home was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake, and the family lived in a makeshift hut nearby. They had used Tirtha Bahadur’s earnings from his previous two-year stint in Malaysia prior to the earthquake, as well as a loan, to build a house. But he left for Qatar before it was ready.  Suntali now has to look after their four children on her own. It costs NPR20,000 to NPR30,000 (CHF135 to CHF200) a month just to educate them. Her social standing in her community is also under pressure. She finds it difficult to contribute her share to family festivities. “I struggled to come up with money for my nephew’s Bratabandha ceremony,” she says, referring to a coming-of-age ritual performed in a boy’s teenage years. Suntali has chickens and a cow, as well as a small patch of farmland that provides subsistence for the family for up to five months a year. She works as a farm labourer to make ends meet.  She gets emotional and tears up when asked what her biggest challenge is. A neighbour says it is dealing with the loss of her husband, who was a good man. In the year 2021-2022, a total of 1,395 Nepali migrant workers (including 39 women) died, with most deaths attributed to “natural causes”. However, this has not dissuaded the younger generation from seeking their future abroad. “My elder daughter is learning Korean as she wants to migrate there. It costs NPR20,000 for a six-month course,” she says.  A Migrant Resource Centre

(MRC) jointly funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Nepalese government has helped Suntali access compensation she was entitled to as the widow of a migrant who died in foreign employment. She received NPR700,000 (CHF4,700) from the company her husband worked for, NPR700,000 from the Nepal Foreign Employment Board and NPR1,300,000 (CHF8,800) from the insurance company. She attends financial literacy classes at the MRC to learn how to use the money wisely.Suntali is one of the lucky ones. Binod Ghorsaine, a returnee migrant who is paid by the Swiss project to identify migrant families in need and refer them to the MRC, guides SWI swissinfo.ch on his motorbike to his village of Mitinichhap to meet another widow who is in less fortunate circumstances.  Rampyari Ghorsaine is in a hurry as she is late for work. She earns some money as a farm labourer working in other villagers’ fields. Despite running late, she doesn’t skimp on hospitality and offers water to drink and guavas to eat.  Her husband wanted their two sons to get a better education, but he was rebuffed by his relatives when he expressed a desire to send them to private school. This pushed him to seek work abroad, and he left for Qatar in 2008. “For the first three months I had no information from my husband. There was no phone in the village. He then sent NPR40,000 (CHF270) and a few months later I enrolled my elder son in a private school,” she says. Rampyari’s husband died a mere ten months after starting work as a labourer in Qatar. His death was attributed to natural causes by his employer, which meant there was no right to compensation. At the time there were also no provisions from the Nepali government for migrant widows, and the migrant insurance scheme was only introduced six months after his death. All Rampyari received was NPR100,000 (CHF675) from the company and the recruitment agency coughed up NPR20,000 (CHF135) to cover the cost of the funeral rituals.  “My husband was not an educated man, and I was worried he would find it difficult to manage abroad. I felt we could have a better life here together. We have some land and can survive,” she says.  After her husband’s death, Rampyari was aloof, did not sleep well and was on medication for depression. She received psychological counselling from the MRC to better deal with her loss. She also has to deal with not having her elder son by her side. Despite her reluctance, she took out a loan of NPR1.5 million (CHF10,100) and sent him to Japan to study. “I am against migration and would not advise anyone to send their family abroad,” she says.  Maili Tamang of Danda Sim village is not a widow but she almost became one. She took out a loan of NPR125,000 (CHF850) from a cooperative to pay the recruitment agency their commission to send her husband Gyan Bahadur Tamang to Malaysia.  He had worked as a migrant there 13 years ago and returned with enough savings to build a house, but it was destroyed by the 2015 earthquake. He decided to return to earn more money but was cheated by his agency.  “The agency promised me a salary of 900 ringgit (CHF170) a month, but I was paid only 700 ringgit. It was not sufficient for survival, and I ran away from my employer,” he says. “The government must crack down on agencies and companies that cheat migrants.” Gyan Bahadur continued working in Malaysia as an undocumented labourer until he fell sick due to a bladder stone. PNCC, the migrants association, helped get him treatment there and arranged his repatriation to Nepal, but Maili had to sell her jewellery to raise the remaining money to bring him back to the village.  “There are many families that earn a lot from migration and are able to buy land. But I had to sell my gold earrings,” she says.  It was very difficult for her to manage with three children on her own. She did everything from taking care of their education, paying off a loan to build the house to working in the kitchen garden. Despite working hard, she was unable to save money as her husband could not send any because of his own dire situation. Maili participated in a 21-week financial literacy class offered by the Migrant Resource Centre which prompted her to take a loan and buy a second cow. She also received psychological counselling to manage her stress and anxiety.    “She was so skinny when I came back. Now I let her sleep a bit longer and milk the cows myself in the morning,” says Gyan Bahadur.  According to Sharu Joshi, an independent expert on foreign labour migration and employment, the most negative impact of migration in Nepal is that women’s workload has increased immensely. Statistics from the International Labour Organization (ILO) show that Nepalese women perform 85% of daily unpaid care work, amounting to 29 million hours a day cumulatively, compared to just five million hours spent by men.  “This shows that women perform six times more unpaid work than men in Nepal compared to the average of four times in the South Asian region. Due to migration, whatever small contribution the Nepalese men were doing has also disappeared,” says Sharu.  As proof, she points to Nepal’s recent success in meeting social indicators of development despite its cash-strapped government. The United Nations has deemed that the country reached its 2019 targets of social, economic and political empowerment as laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals. “How is that possible? This is because the work that the state is meant to do like nutrition, family health and welfare is taken care of by women,” says Sharu. Dandagaun village located in ward 2 of Dhulikhel municipality has a sex ratio of only 91 men for every 100 women (the national average is 95.6) based on the 2021 census. It also has the second-smallest household size in the municipality, with 3.83 inhabitants per household (the national average is 4.37). Migration of young men abroad is a fact of life here.  “In the early days people in the village supported each other. Now the village is empty,” says inhabitant Yasodha Gautam.  Her husband, a former soldier in the Nepalese army, has been working in Dubai for the last year and a half as a food delivery driver. Yasodha runs a small shop and looks after her two sons. She did not want him to go, but he wanted to see the world and send their children to good schools so that they can become senior officers in the army.  “I am neither happy nor sad. He is not here but he has gone for our future,” she says.  Bhim Prasad Sapkota, a senior public health administrator at Nepal’s ministry of health and population, is worried about the impact of migration on the country’s demography. The annual population growth rate has fallen from 1.35% in the 2011 census to 0.92% in the 2021 census, the lowest it has been since the first census of 1911. The total fertility rate has also fallen from 2.6 in 2011 to 2.1 in 2022, even though the use of modern contraception among married women between the ages of 15 and 49 has remained constant at 43% during the same period, according to the 2022 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey. “The migration of the young population is affecting fertility but also economic and social development,” says Bhim Prasad. “It is something that has to be considered seriously by policymakers, politicians and civil society.” According to the 2022 Nepal Labour Migration Report, 7.4% of the country’s population lives abroad, but this figure does not include informal migration or migration to India, which does not need an official labour approval from the government. The closest to the truth is the 2021 census, which shows that 23.4% of households have an absent family member living abroad.  “We have youthless and toothless villages. Of the 77 districts in Nepal, 14 are in population deficit,” says Sharu Joshi, who previously worked for UN Women and the government. “Only 6% of the population now lives in the mountains, compared to 40% in the hills and 54% in Terai [plains].” According to her, during the ten-year civil war there were around 200 people leaving the country every day, but today in times of relative peace and stability the exodus has increased to 3,000 people leaving every day. What the numbers do not show is the social pressure young men face to leave home and work abroad.  “There is a sort of competition within families over how many of their menfolk are working abroad. Migrants are perceived as more masculine while those who stay back are viewed as less mard [manly] as they do not take risks,” says Sharu. The women who are left behind also risk being perceived unfavourably in their communities. A 2019 study funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation surveyed over 1,000 migrant wives in Saptari and Dhanisha districts and found they were more likely to be suspected of misusing remittances and having extramarital affairs. However, researchers from the Nepal Institute for Social and Environmental Research that conducted the study found little evidence of this on the ground.  “There were in total three cases where women had extramarital affairs and that could have been the case even if the husband had not migrated. But stories were extrapolated, and it spread in different forms all over the district, false narratives are made and established,” state the authors of the study. Articles in the press based on anecdotes have created a negative image of migrant wives and add fuel to the fire. It has created a general feeling of mistrust between couples.  “Not everyone’s migration is successful. Some men and women have second marriages [a euphemism for separation in Nepal],” says shopkeeper Yasodha.  Across the road to Yasodha’s shop is a restaurant run by Mirani Lama. Her husband shares the same room and does the same job in Dubai as Yasodha’s husband. She must manage the busy business and look after their son and household. “It’s not very easy to run the restaurant by myself, but my brother and sister support me,” she says. Mirani’s family needs the money from Dubai. Her husband sends NPR92,000 (CHF620) direct to her account every month. In 2021, official records show that migrants sent home remittances totalling NPR1.06 trillion ($7.15 billion), equivalent to 23.8% of Nepal’s GDP. It is no surprise that most conversations in Nepal on migration revolve around the remittances sent home. However, lately there is also some reflection on the societal cost of sending so many young men abroad. For example, the 2021 census shows that 17.1% of children live without their father. “Migrant families have better access to health and education with the help of remittances. But their lifestyle is not as good due to the absence of a parent and the children’s growth and development as well as socialisation is negatively affected,” says government official Bhim Prasad. The bureaucrat wants the government to design some policy interventions so that the Nepalese abroad can return to their country and start their own business based on the knowledge and skills they have acquired abroad. This way they can contribute directly to the national economy. Ultimately, this is only possible if returnees and their wives feel they have a better future in Nepal than in Qatar or Malaysia.  Most seem to want to return to work abroad given that the Nepalese Department of Foreign Employment has renewed 1.8 million labour approvals since 2011/2012. A 2021 Covid-19 assessment report of Nepal by the International Organization for Migration showed that 64% of those who had returned home due to the pandemic wanted to re-migrate.  Given the importance of remittances to the economy, the government has made it easier to renew labour approvals by allowing it to be done from the embassy in the destination country (up to two times) and even online.  “The country is running on remittances, but the politicians say they do not want people to leave and want the migrants to come back,” says Sharu. As far as the two families interviewed by SWI swissinfo.ch in Dandagaun village are concerned, the future is mixed. Yasodha’s husband, who turns 40 next year, returns home from Dubai in six months. She does not want him to leave the family again for Dubai but knows she cannot stop him if he remains in good health. “It’s not like there’s no future in the country, but if things are as they are, he will return abroad again,” she says.  Mirani’s husband returns home in ten months. She is looking forward to his return as they’ve made a major decision together.  “We’ve mutually agreed that he will not work abroad again. Instead, we plan to expand the restaurant,” she says. Edited by Marc Leutenegger ","October 25, 2023 - 09:00"

Although passenger numbers have not yet reached pre-pandemic level, they are approaching the 2019 figures.Neither Cyrill Hermann, a climate striker, nor behavioural researcher Christian Fichter is surprised by this development. “If the figures had remained low, I would have been surprised,” Fichter says. “People can change, but only within certain limits. Sustainable change is difficult to implement.”The climate movement and, as a result, flight shaming did have an effect on flying. “But it wasn’t as big as people thought,” Fichter says. It’s true, he says, that many people around the world were concerned about flying – “as a society, we want to do something about climate change” – but he points out that “this is the central purpose of life only for a small proportion of people and, accordingly, only a small proportion are willing to restrict their consumer behaviour to such an extent”.Cyrill Hermann struggles with the concept of flight shaming. “We take a critical view of flight shaming. The responsibility for CO₂ emissions does not lie with the individual, but with airlines and the Swiss government,” he says, explaining that they are responsible for reducing short-haul flights by 2030, for example.So everything is fine if we jet off on holiday once, twice or three times a year? No, Hermann says. “I personally wouldn’t do it, but I’m not angry with the people who do.”The shock of 2019, when the climate movement was at its peak, is probably gone and with it the sense of shame. Hermann understands this. “I don’t see the point of reducing my emissions either, as long as 100 companies alone are responsible for more than 70% of emissions. Many people no longer see the responsibility as lying solely with themselves.”Behavioural researcher Christian Fichter echoes a similar sentiment. Travellers see themselves in a dilemma. On the one hand, they are motivated to protect the environment, but on the other, they also want to have a good time. “In the end, it’s all about comfort and your wallet.” Although ticket prices have risen in recent years, the pain threshold has still not been reached for many travellers, he says.Generally speaking, there are four levers for sustainably consolidating change, Fichter says. In addition to comfort and money, for example, there is social ostracism, as was the case with flight shaming. “What’s much better and more effective, however, is conviction. You should inform and empower people so that they can think about a situation and then adapt their behaviour,” he says.Translated from German by DeepL/ts","March 13, 2024 - 11:00"
136,Russia says U.S. ban on Russian nuclear fuel will harm global market,"By Anastasia LyrchikovaMOSCOW (Reuters) – Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom said on Tuesday that a U.S. ban on Russian nuclear fuel was discriminatory political move that would undermine the global market for enriched uranium but said it would continue to develop its global business.President Joe Biden signed into law a ban on Russian enriched uranium on Monday, the White House said. About 24% of the enriched uranium used by U.S. nuclear power plants comes from Russia.“We consider the recently enacted U.S. law banning the import of Russian enriched uranium as discriminatory and non-market-oriented,” Rosatom said in a written statement to Reuters.“Rosatom maintains its strong position as a global leader in nuclear technologies and will continue to develop relations with foreign partners interested in long-term cooperation.”Rosatom said in 2022 that it was the world’s biggest player in enriched uranium with 35% of the world market as well as holding the world’s second largest uranium reserves and being the world’s second largest uranium producer.The Kremlin said the U.S. decision to ban Russian fuel was not critical for Russia but said that the Americans, when they found it difficult to compete with Russia, reached for measures which distorted and undermined the norms of global markets.“This is nothing more than unfair competition,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Our nuclear industry is one of the most advanced in the world, it is extremely competitive, and we will continue to develop this industry.”Rosatom said the U.S. decision was “harmful to the sustainable functioning of the global market for nuclear fuel cycle products and services.”Russia is currently boosting the share of nuclear energy in its energy production. The share of nuclear is projected to reach 25% by 2045 from 20% currently, according to Rosatom.","May 14, 2024 - 18:06"
137,Battle for development cash heats up at IMF/World Bank meetings,"By Libby George and Karin StroheckerLONDON (Reuters) – Development agencies gathering in Washington this week face one of their toughest battles in years: getting a rich world worried about wars abroad and elections at home to commit more cash to the world’s poorest countries.The poor world’s development is backsliding at an historic rate amid debt crises, higher-for-longer global interest rates and mounting investment needs. At the same time, it needs trillions more per year to meet climate spending goals alone.At the last round of IMF and World Bank meetings in October, global leaders expected rich-world inflation to ease more quickly than it has, and thus for interest rate cuts to take pressure off financing costs.Since then, an expanding conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine have thrown up additional funding pressures, curbing the rich world’s already waning appetite to spend on development aid.“Budgetary constraint in a number of countries is increasing,” Odile Renaud-Basso, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development told Reuters in London ahead of the meetings. “There is more expenditure for defense and there is tension about support for development aid.”“The global situation is becoming increasingly challenging,” she added.Renaud-Basso said lenders trying to raise funds, such as World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), would provide a bellwether for the rich world’s appetite to donate.The World Bank’s lending arm to poor countries is targeting record commitments above its last replenishment of $93 billion, which it used early due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has begun issuing bonds to leverage its lending.“We’ve been able to do more with the same level of donor contributions,” IDA director Dirk Reinermann told Reuters. “The problem is that this party is slowly coming to an end…the zero point where we are fully leveraged, it’s coming closer and closer.”In its last replenishment, 52 high- and middle-income countries contributed, led by the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and France.But many of those are grappling with donor fatigue. France and the UK have made large cuts to overseas aid in recent years, while in the United States political battles ahead of the presidential election have stalled other foreign spending commitments, including to Israel and Ukraine.According to a recent United Nations report, official development assistance globally hit a record in 2022, but the share of it going to developing countries fell by 2%.“I don’t think the world has ever been in such a state,” said Vera Songwe, chair of the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility, a group that aims to lower debt costs for Africa.Songwe herself worked on IDA’s replenishment round during her time at the World Bank, and described a whirlwind global tour to press finance ministers, parliamentarians and other officials for funding.It is never an easy sell, she said. But this year is different.“Even in 2008, China was still growing then. This is much more difficult.”It amounts to a perfect storm for poor countries. In the decade after the global financial crisis, with record-low interest rates, money flowed freely and the external public debt stock in low and middle income rose to $9 trillion, from $5.6 trillion in 2012.China during that time also opened its financial taps, lending billions via its Belt and Road Initiative. But amid simmering debt problems at home, it has since pulled back.This has significantly narrowed the availability of affordable finance for developing countries.“There are very few such pots of money with such low concessional rates the world over, especially pots of money that come from a multilateral lender that has certain checks and balances,” said Giulia Pellegrini, a senior portfolio manager for emerging market debt at Allianz Global Investors.Getting money from IDA, or another multilateral lender such as EBRD, can spur private lenders and eurobond investors to open their wallets, she added.“Seeing a strong vote of confidence from some of these multilateral bodies, giving them concessional finance is a way to say these countries are embarking on a positive reform,” she said.Reinermann said IDA’s backing from the World Bank itself and other institutions is strong. But that would not, he said, make securing commitments easy.“Fiscal situations are not flush anywhere,” he said. “Right now it looks like a real mountain to climb.”","April 18, 2024 - 14:13"
138,"Scholz, Biden to discuss Ukraine aid, NATO and Israel war","By Andreas Rinke and Sarah MarshBERLIN (Reuters) – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his talks with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington on Friday will focus on how to strengthen support for Ukraine to help it battle Russia’s invasion.Ukraine, which is outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield in a war about to head into its third year, relies heavily on its Western allies for military and financial support.The United States has to date been Kyiv’s biggest backer but Scholz’s visit to Washington comes as worry is mounting over its commitment to Ukraine, with Congress stalling over an aid package request made by Biden in October amid political infighting.The possible return of Donald Trump to the White House could further damage that commitment, European politicians worry.“What has so far been agreed in Europe and the U.S. Congress is not enough so far,” Scholz said at the airport in Berlin shortly before flying off to Washington. “So we need to find a way for us all to do more together.”Scholz’s visit will start on Thursday with a dinner with U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. On Friday morning he will have breakfast with U.S. business leaders before meeting with Biden in the afternoon.The European Union approved a four-year 50 billion euro ($54 billion) facility for Ukraine last week in a boost for Kyiv which depends heavily on its Western allies for military and financial support.Germany alone has so far delivered or committed to some 28 billion euros in aid for Ukraine, government officials say.“Germany has already made a very large contribution,” Scholz said. “But that will not be enough on its own.”Ukrainian military officials have said they face an acute shortage of ammunition and artillery shells as Russian forces press on with renewed assaults on several areas in the east and southeast of the country.Scholz warned that a potential Russian victory was not just of concern for Ukraine and Europe but the whole world, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal published on Thursday.“Russia’s brutal attempt to steal territory by force could serve as a blueprint for other authoritarian leaders around the globe,” he said. “More countries would run the risk of falling prey to a nearby predator.”Scholz aimed to also discuss plans for strengthening the western NATO defence alliance and the Israel-Hamas war in his meeting with Biden, German government officials said.Scholz said both felt the responsibility to stand by Israel’s side while developing the conditions necessary for a sustainable peace in the region, such as a two-state solution and humanitarian aid for Gaza.","February 8, 2024 - 15:02"
139,Lufthansa’s risky Italy bet hinges on Rome airport expansion,"By Angelo Amante, Joanna Plucinska and Ilona WissenbachROME/LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) – Lufthansa’s long-promised turnaround of Italy’s ITA Airways, crucial to help revive the German airline’s fortunes, is interlinked with Rome airport Fiumicino’s ability to implement an ambitious expansion plan.Struggling with high costs and prolonged delays in Boeing plane deliveries, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said on Oct. 1 that investing in further international growth – which includes the agreed purchase of a 41% stake in Alitalia successor ITA – would help to revamp the hard-hit Cologne-based carrier.Yet, ITA’s prospects are closely tied to those of Rome’s main airport. Fiumicino is still waiting for clearance from Italian airport regulator ENAC to double its capacity to 100 million passengers annually by building a third terminal and more runway space.“One of the reasons that further pushed us to invest in ITA Airways was the quality of Fiumicino. It is one of the few airports in Europe that has capacity for growth, both in terms of terminals and runways,” Spohr, who sees the airport as a gateway to Africa and Latin America, said in July.Aeroporti di Roma (ADR) is owned by infrastructure group Mundys, controlled by the Italian Benetton family and equity firm Blackstone. The airport manager submitted in 2021 an 8-billion-euro development plan for Fiumicino to ENAC, which is still assessing it.Some sector analysts are however questioning Lufthansa’s focus on Fiumicino: “They have identified Rome as a hub for Latin America. But ITA is not as ideally positioned as (Portugal’s) TAP or (Spain’s) Air Europa,” said Ruxandra Haradau-Doser from HSBC.Contacted by Reuters, ENAC did not respond to a request to comment on the approval process, while ADR declined to comment on this same issue.A Lufthansa spokesperson said the success of ITA was not only dependent on the success of the Roman airport, but also on that of the Milan catchment area, in Italy’s north.RELAUNCHING ITAFederico Maria Alberto Caligaris, an equity partner at advisory firm CDI Global, says the focus on Fiumicino makes sense while Lufthansa has difficulties at growing its other hubs.Andrea Giuricin, CEO of transport advisory firm TRA Consulting, predicted the airport, which welcomed over 40 million passengers in 2023, would exceed next year the 50 million threshold and grow further thanks to strong intercontinental and tourist traffic towards Italy’s capital.The airport’s lean business model is also attractive: last year, operating costs amounted to 60% of 2023 revenue against around 74% in Frankfurt, according to Reuters calculations.The cost per passenger a carrier must pay when a medium-range aircraft accesses a main European airport is between 30% and 90% higher than at Fiumicino, Giuricin told Reuters.“On intercontinental flights, Fiumicino is also cheaper: Frankfurt costs almost double and in general the fees are between 35% and 75% higher,” he said.Fiumicino, where travellers can view statues and paintings from the ancient Roman times in a corridor leading to a new boarding area opened in 2022, won last year Europe’s best airport award from industry body the Airports Council International.Yet, travellers feel more could be done to expand it and improve train connections with Rome, which is some 30 km away.“The airport is good and beautiful but I’d expect a bigger one for a city like Rome,” said Brazilian tourist Felipe Paiva as he walked past the Temple of Hadrian in central Rome. “And transport to the city can definitely be improved.”UNCERTAINTIESLufthansa’s inability to control Fiumicino’s expansion add a layer of complication to its bet on ITA, whose predecessor Alitalia faced multiple bankruptcies.Spiralling labour costs have forced the German airline to issue two profit warnings this year, with analysts and investors warning that Spohr’s ITA investment was not a silver bullet.“The plan sounds plausible and rational at first glance, but there are implementation risks,” said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate investment at Deka Investment, which owns Lufthansa shares.  Some analysts also stress that while Rome is a hub for inbound leisure traffic, the capital isn’t the most natural destination for core business travellers.Italy’s main airport hub “should really be in Milan, which is where the money is, where the power is, but it’s not where the politics is,” said aviation analyst James Halstead. A source in the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who declined to be named, told Reuters the right-wing coalition had no objection to further growth at Fiumicino.The source added Milan’s main airport, Malpensa, had a fairly diversified portfolio of carriers and would retain its role even if Fiumicino expanded, but added its proximity to Lufthansa’s main German hubs of Frankfurt and Munich could undermine it in the future. “Rome is not actually a very good hub for the rest of Europe,” said Halstead. “There may be some opportunities down into South America, because of the appeal to the (Italian) diaspora in Argentina and Brazil, but it’s a bit out of the way to attract traffic.”($1 = 0.8958 euros)   ","October 11, 2024 - 06:10"
140,"SNB Discloses Carbon Footprint, Won’t Change Investment Policy","(Bloomberg) — The Swiss National Bank won’t change how it invests its huge foreign-currency reserves for environmental reasons, once again rebuffing calls for it to take a more active stance on climate change.It said it’s “not authorized to pursue structural policies” and pursuing such actions could make it more difficult for it to fulfill its primary mandate of inflation control. The SNB was commenting in its Sustainability Report, where it disclosed the carbon footprint of its portfolio for the first time. A new law came into force this year obliging large Swiss companies to be transparent on their climate impact.The SNB “may not influence economic, political or social developments through its investment policy,” it said. “This also applies to pursuing a plan to reduce” greenhouse gas emissions.While certain companies are excluded from the SNB’s portfolio — in particular arms-makers and banks — the SNB’s environmental rules only ban coal miners. That means its holdings include firms involved in fracking, and the oil and gas industries.But the central bank said Tuesday that as the climate change transition affects companies, and their stocks and bonds, that will also affect the SNB’s broad portfolio of holdings.“Diversification means that the SNB’s equity and corporate bond portfolios’ exposure to risks is similar to that of the global universe of companies, and that structural changes, for example the transition to a sustainable economy, are also reflected in the SNB’s portfolios,” it said in the report.Central banks are increasingly addressing climate change issues, with many citing risks to financial stability from rising global temperatures.Sweden’s Riksbank sold bonds in Australian and Canadian states with high carbon dioxide emissions, and the European Central Bank began prioritizing purchasing bonds from lower-polluting companies Meanwhile, the Network for Greening the Financial System, created in 2017 by a handful of central banks, has now grown to 138 members, including financial supervisors. The SNB joined in 2019.But critics say environmental issues have been a distraction for central bankers and they should focus on their core inflation mandates. SNB President Thomas Jordan said in January that central banks lack the tools to fight climate change. –With assistance from Frances Schwartzkopff.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","March 28, 2024 - 08:01"
141,"North Korea’s Kim pushes for regional development with construction projects, KCNA reports","By Hyonhee ShinSEOUL (Reuters) – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for developing health, science and education facilities in rural areas alongside factories, state media KCNA reported on Monday, amid concerns over economic hardships and poor living conditions.Kim convened a high-level meeting on Saturday as the ruling Workers’ Party seeks to adopt a “new important decision” to speed up rural development under his “Regional Development 20×10 Policy” aimed at opening modernised factories in at least 20 remote counties every year for the next 10 years, KCNA reported.He has been pushing to modernise the farming industry and rural communities because North Korea’s economy relies heavily on agriculture but continues to struggle with food shortages amid sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes as well as seasonal impacts from natural disasters.Kim said the construction of health, science and grain management facilities in cities and counties is an essential, urgent task in accelerating and improving regional development, according to KCNA.“Building light industry factories in local areas … alone is not enough to provide the regional people across the country with a sustained and improved material and cultural life,” KCNA quoted him as telling the meeting.Kim ordered prioritising the completion of modern health facilities “without fail” in the face of any challenges, KCNA said.“He said that it is his first cherished desire to build city and county hospitals which will greatly contribute to improving the regional health situation (that is) relatively inferior, and promoting the life and security and health of local people,” it added.The country has launched a new military unit and mobilised troops nationwide to spur the construction initiative, but South Korean officials and experts have questioned its feasibility, citing a lack of resources given Pyongyang has long prioritised its weapons programmes.","September 2, 2024 - 01:33"
142,Science and diplomacy: two Swiss strengths help anticipate tomorrow’s world,"Artificial intelligence, quantum computing and climate engineering: have you heard of them? Most likely yes, and perhaps you have already experienced for yourself the potential of tools such as ChatGPT or read articles about the possibility of modifying solar radiation.However, there is one question that nobody can answer yet. How will these technologies affect our lives and our planet in the future? We don’t know. But that’s no reason to leave it to powerful states or large multinational corporations to define the impact of technological revolutions on society.“We live in a world where technology is developing rapidly. We have the feeling that there are no rules and that governance is lagging behind technology. But it doesn’t have to be that way,” said Michael Hengartner, president of the ETH Board

, which oversees Switzerland’s two federal technology institutes.Hengartner was speaking at an event held on Tuesday at the headquarters of SWI swissinfo.ch in Bern, which was attended by representatives from science, diplomacy, politics and the media. The discussion centred on the role of scientific anticipation in diplomacy and possible Swiss solutions to major global problems.One promoter of such solutions is the Geneva-based foundation GESDA (Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator), which analyses scientific research and technological trends to develop recommendations for policymakers and diplomats.GESDA was founded in 2019 as a joint initiative of the government and the city and canton of Geneva. It promotes dialogue between science and diplomacy in order to find solutions to issues such as the climate crisis, sustainability and health.The climate issue is a typical area where “science becomes an instrument of diplomacy”, Alexandre Fasel, State Secretary of the foreign ministry, told SWI swissinfo.ch. He cited as an example the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which develops measures for the international community in the area of climate. “We have invited science into the diplomatic process,” Fasel said.“Switzerland has a strong tradition of scientific diplomacy,” emphasised Larissa M. Bieler, director of SWI swissinfo.ch, recalling that CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, helped bring Europe and the world closer again through science after the Second World War.GESDA is not looking back. It’s looking to the future to assess how scientific developments will progress over the next five, ten or 25 years. The expectations are summarised in the “Science Breakthrough Radar”, which the foundation believes should become a tool for multilateral negotiations in International Geneva and beyond.“But that’s not enough,” warned Michael Hengartner, chair of the GESDA Academic Committee. It is also crucial to know which technological developments are relevant for society and for which a multilateral discussion should begin now, he said. The aim is to maximise the positive effects and ensure that everyone has access to them, and to reduce the possible negative effects, he added.One specific project is the Open Quantum Institute. The Geneva-based institute has set itself the goal of putting quantum technologies at the service of the common good and thereby achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals more quickly. According to Alexandre Fasel, the dramatic increase in the computing power of computers should not only benefit large companies, but also people in poorer countries.Quantum computers are not the only area in which Switzerland can offer global solutions, noted Marcel Tanner, president emeritus of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Switzerland has already laid the foundations for complex issues relating to climate, energy and neuroscience that can be built upon.GESDA acts as a bridge between cutting-edge researchers and stakeholders in the public and private sectors, as was emphasised during the panel discussion. GESDA’s strength lies in bringing the main players together for joint reflection without falling into a negotiating logic in which everyone tries to assert their own position. “However, the solutions must come from diplomacy, companies and governments,” Fasel explained.The challenge is to think about the distant future now. Imogen Foulkes, a journalist for the BBC in Geneva and host of the SWI swissinfo.ch podcast “Inside Geneva”, reminded the audience that diplomacy is confronted with current, immediate problems. “They think in short time frames, and that could be a problem for GESDA,” she said.The Covid pandemic has shown how difficult it is to act with foresight, she added. The World Health Organization had urged countries to prepare, but no one responded immediately. “Today, diplomats are perhaps realising a little more that it’s necessary to think more long-term,” Foulkes said.“GESDA is a child that’s only five years old,” Hengartner concluded. “But it has great ambitions to make a positive contribution to society.”Edited and translated from Italian by Reto Gysi von Wartburg.

143,Is Swiss water aid for Jordan just a drop in the ocean?,"A boy waves energetically. He is standing by the roadside, somewhere between the Jordanian capital Amman and the village of Zubarieya to the south, brandishing a hosepipe. He actually wants to get the cars to stop so that he can wash them – but in vain. So he sprays water in a high arc through the dry air, until it splashes down onto the warm ground.“Many Jordanians don’t realise quite how badly the country is affected by water poverty,” says Alaa Alqaisi, a water specialist who has been working for the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) for two years, as we drive past the boy. “So raising awareness among the population is a key aspect of our work.”This is in part why Alqaisi is driving south on this January morning to visit an SDC project in Zubarieya. The dry surroundings bear testimony to the importance of every single drop of water for the kingdom.The situation is certainly alarming. The Middle East is in the grips of a severe water shortage of “unprecedented” scale, according to a recent World Bank study
External link
.Jordan is particularly affected. The kingdom is one of the most water-scarce countries in the world. Declining rainfall, exhausted groundwater sources and severe droughts are causing the land to dry up, in large part as a direct result of the climate crisis
External link
.Compounding matters, Jordan’s population has doubled in the past two decades to 11.5 million people, many of whom are refugees or the descendants of refugees. So not only is less and less water available, but more and more is needed.And the longer the war in Gaza goes on, the more likely it is that Jordan and Israel will sever ties, further exacerbating the pressing water problem.Switzerland is following developments closely, as it sees Jordan as an important hub for humanitarian aid and diplomacy in the region.The Swiss delegation’s arrival is expected in Zubarieya. Representatives of the NGO Mercy Corps Jordan, the SDC’s project partner, are there, as is Abu Osama, representing the village. The elderly man is standing in front of the pumping station, his chequered shirt tucked neatly into his trousers. To his left are several large solar panels.Today, he declares, the village is self-sufficient in terms of energy. “We’ve done a lot of work over the past months, including renovating the pumping station. Now the water supply works better.”This is important, as the vital resource is pumped up from a groundwater source, which is managed by the community, before being distributed to the neighbouring households and farms.All this must be done as efficiently as possible, as around 50% of water is often lost on the way to the end user, explains Zaid Hatokay, programme director at Mercy Corps. “Pumping systems in Jordan are often unreliable. We have improved things here.”Water is also regularly stolen, for example when people cut the pipes and tap into them. The plant in Zubarieya is surrounded by a high wire fence. There is also a security guard who stays there overnight.The SDC project
External link
will run until the end of March, with Switzerland and Australia sharing the funding of around CHF1.8 million ($2 million) equally. After that, the aim is to continue the project with the help of local companies.In the long term, the project seeks to “promote alternative governance structures for water management in rural areas with poor access to water from the national public grid”, the Swiss embassy in Amman said upon request.Water scarcity remains a fact of nature that poses challenges for the country, as Maysoon Zoubi well knows. She has been working in the Jordanian water sector for decades and is now a water diplomacy expert at the engineering firm Arab Dar.“Jordan is what is known in the technical jargon as a downstream country,” Zoubi explains. This means that the main rivers flowing through the desert nation rise in the neighbouring states, so-called upstream countries.These can decide whether to dam the flow and thus withhold water from the downstream country, or let it pour freely into the neighbouring state. In other words, geography distributes negotiating power unequally between states when it comes to water.Do you want to read our weekly top stories? Subscribe hereAnd, here, Jordan is clearly on the losing end. It used to be pushed around by its northern neighbour Syria, where the important Yarmuk River rises.As Zoubi explains, the two countries negotiated an agreement
External link
back in 1987 which, among other things, laid down the framework conditions for a dam, which went into operation in 2011.Some 80% of the construction costs for the dam, known as Al-Wehda (or Unity) Dam, was borne by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. The remainder was split between Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.Jordan also covered the other costs associated with the dam, “from planning to maintenance” as Zoubi explains, revealing Syria’s leverage over its neighbour. It was nonetheless agreed that Syria would allow 208 million cubic metres of water to flow into Jordan each year.Jordan also shares a groundwater source with Saudi Arabia, which is used intensively on both sides
External link
. The relationship over water with Israel, meanwhile, has become particularly fragile since the war in Gaza.Water can exacerbate interstate problems, but it is rarely the cause. Nevertheless, for King Abdullah II it is a make-or-break political issue. “Water is now at the heart of geopolitical tensions between Jordan and Israel,” Zoubi says.Before October 7, 2023, Jordan and Israel were nudging undeniably closer, despite decades of rising tensions in the West Bank, where Israel has been steadily pushing ahead with the building of settlements, in violation of international law; and despite the opposition of the Jordanian people, many of whom have Palestinian roots and harbour a deep aversion to Israel. First and foremost, the former enemies signed a peace treaty in this challenging context in 1994. Still in force today, the text also lays down rules for the use of water from the border river Jordan, the most important water source for Israel and Jordan.Two water agreements were also negotiated. Jordan has been buying Israeli water (up to 100 million cubic metres annually) for years. Last October, a deal was due to be signed on the exchange of Jordanian electricity for Israeli water.But that all now seems like history. In the shadow of the war in Gaza, rapprochement is far from the order of the day. “Never before, not since the peace treaty was signed, has Jordan criticised the Israeli government so much,” says Zoubi.Last November, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi declared it was currently “impossible to have any normal relations with Israel”
External link
. He had quickly recalled his ambassador from Israel in response to the escalation in Gaza. The Israeli government reacted sharply and is even threatening to turn off the water tap
External link
.Yet despite this bleak scenario, there is still a glimmer of hope. Even as tensions increase across the region, work is afoot to strengthen cooperation on water policy and, in so doing, promote sustainable development and peace. This is how the Blue Peace initiative came into being in the region, with the involvement not just of Jordan and Syria, but also Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Lebanon.Switzerland plays a key role in this cross-border water cooperation by facilitating dialogue between political decision-makers and taking other supporting measures.The situation could soon improve in Jordan, too. In just three years, it should be possible to desalinate large amounts of water from the Red Sea and pump it to the capital, Amman, 450 kilometres away, and its surrounding regions – in a project that is costly and therefore not without controversy.Despite the praise and enthusiasm of Abu Osama, the Zubarieya community representative, for the progress brought about in his village, Zaid Hatokay of Mercy Corps is convinced that “the key to a water-secure Jordan is the desalination of seawater”.Edited by Sabrina Weiss.

144,"Exclusive-OpenAI’s stunning $150 billion valuation hinges on upending corporate structure, sources say","By Krystal Hu and Kenrick Cai(Reuters) – OpenAI’s new financing round is expected to come in the form of convertible notes, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who said its $150 billion valuation will be contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker can upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors.The details of the conditions of the $6.5 billion funding, which have not been previously reported, show how far OpenAI, the most valuable AI startup in the world, has come from a research-based non-profit, and the structural changes it’s willing to make to attract ever more investment to fund its expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that surpasses human intelligence.The outsized funding round has seen strong investor demand and could be finalized in the next two weeks, given the rapid growth of OpenAI’s revenue, sources added.Existing investors such as Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, as well as Microsoft are expected to participate. New investors including Nvidia and Apple also plan to invest. Sequoia Capital is also in talks to come back as a returning investor.If the restructuring is unsuccessful, OpenAI would need to renegotiate its valuation with investors at which their shares will be converted, likely at a lower number, sources told Reuters, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. Asked about the financing and potential change, OpenAI said in a statement that it remains focusing on building AI that benefits everyone while working with its non-profit board.“The nonprofit is core to our mission and will continue to exist,” the company spokesperson said.The removal of the profit cap would require approval from OpenAI’s non-profit board, consisting of Chief Executive Sam Altman, entrepreneur Bret Taylor and seven other members.The company has also held discussions with lawyers about turning its non-profit structure to a for-profit benefit corporation, similar to what its rivals such as Anthropic and xAI are using, sources added, confirming media reports.It is unclear if such fundamental corporate structural changes could happen. The removal of the profit cap, which put a limit on investors’ potential returns in OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, would hand early investors an even bigger win.It could also raise questions about OpenAI’s governance and departure from its non-profit mission. OpenAI has said the cap was put in place to “incentivize them to research, develop, and deploy AGI in a way that balances commerciality with safety and sustainability, rather than focusing on pure profit-maximization.”The San Francisco-based AI lab, founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research project, with the goal of building AI for the benefit of humanity, is currently controlled by a non-profit parent organization.It has accelerated its commercialization efforts by selling subscription-based services like ChatGPT to consumers and enterprises, which now boasts over 200 million users.Existing investors are beholden to a capped limit to their return on investment, with any additional returns to be routed to the non-profit.Returns were capped at 100x the investment for investors in OpenAI’s first round of financing. “We expect this multiple to be lower for future rounds,” the company said in a 2019 blog post detailing the structure.OpenAI used this model to raise more than $10 billion in recent years, with the majority coming from Microsoft. It was last valued at $80 billion in February in a tender offer deal where the company sold existing shares led by Thrive Capital.","September 14, 2024 - 15:20"
145,UK announces new climate envoy and investment facility,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Britain on Thursday named Oxford University professor Rachel Kyte as its new climate envoy and announced a new investment facility, the latest steps in the new government’s efforts to bolster Britain’s role in international climate politics.The appointment of Kyte, a climate policy professor, as the UK’s special representative for climate comes six weeks before COP29, the latest annual U.N. climate summit. Countries from around the world will meet in Azerbaijan to try to thrash out new deals to halt rising global temperatures, mitigate the damage they have caused and raise funding for those who have been worst affected.In her career Kyte has focused on ways to generate energy in fair and sustainable ways. She previously worked for the World Bank in the run-up to the landmark Paris 2015 Paris climate agreement, and later as a special representative on sustainable energy for the United Nations secretary-general.“Rachel’s expertise and experience in international and climate crisis roles will help drive UK international leadership on the agenda and across the world,” British foreign minister David Lammy said.Earlier this week energy security and net zero minister Ed Miliband said Britain was “back in the business of climate leadership”, criticising the previous Conservative-led government for rolling back some of its climate targets.Last week Lammy said Britain would put climate change at the heart of decisions about foreign policy, and appoint two new climate envoys: one for climate and one for nature. Kyte takes up the climate brief while the nature envoy has yet to be announced.Addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose Labour Party won a July election, also announced a new facility “to mobilise billions in pension and insurance funds to invest in boosting development and fighting climate change.”British International Investment, Britain’s development finance arm, will manage the facility, which aims to attract capital to invest in climate and sustainability-focussed projects in emerging markets by providing first-loss guarantees for the investments to reduce the risk.BII said the facility offers a novel approach to mobilising private capital because it is aimed at a previously untapped pool of investors which it will bring in directly to the projects at a much earlier stage of investment.“Public finance will never fully meet the needs, so we must use it as a multiplier to unlock much greater levels of private investment,” Starmer said.(Reporting by William James and Virginia Furness; additional reporting by Michelle Nichols in New York; writing by Alistair Smout; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Jonathan Oatis)","September 27, 2024 - 01:00"
146,Explainer-What are the security deals Ukraine is signing with allies?,"By Tom Balmforth and Yuliia DysaKYIV (Reuters) – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he will sign bilateral security agreements with the United States and Japan on the sidelines of the Group of Seven Summit in Italy on Thursday.The two countries are set to be the last two G7 nations to sign such deals. Fifteen countries have already signed such deals on security cooperation, pledging to keep up their long-term support in the 27-month-old, full-scale war with Russia.WHAT ARE THESE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS?The Group of Seven wealthy nations signed a joint declaration at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July last year committing to establish “long-term security commitments and arrangements” that would be negotiated with Ukraine bilaterally.The deals, it said, would promise continued provision of military and security aid, support to develop Ukraine’s defence industrial base, training Ukrainian soldiers, intelligence-sharing and cooperation, and support for cyber defence.The sides would also immediately hold consultations withKyiv to determine “appropriate next steps” in the event of a”future Russian armed attack”.More than 30 countries have since signed the declaration.A SUBSTITUTE FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP?Kyiv says the arrangements should contain important andconcrete security commitments, but that the agreements would inno way to replace its strategic goal of joining NATO. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause.“There has been speculation that by concluding enough ofthese agreements, we do not need membership. False. We need NATOmembership,” said Ihor Zhovkva, the Ukrainian president’sforeign affairs adviser.WHO HAS SIGNED DEALS SO FAR?Britain in January became the first country to sign one of the security agreements with Ukraine for a term of 10 years, bywhich time Kyiv hopes to be inside NATO.London said the deal formalised a range of support that it “has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence-sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defence industrial cooperation”.Germany and France were next to sign the documents, followed by Denmark, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Finland, Latvia, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.WHAT DOES UKRAINE WANT FROM THE DEALS?Ukraine’s Zhovkva singled out as “very important” theprovision in the British deal under which consultations could beheld within 24 hours to provide swift and sustained aid.This, he said, went beyond the “infamous” 1994 BudapestMemorandum under which Ukraine was provided with security”assurances” by Britain, Russia and the United States in returnfor relinquishing nuclear weapons from its territory.“We do not want to repeat the infamous experience of theBudapest declaration, which remained just a declaration,” hesaid.Zhovkva said there was no need for Ukraine to rush to agreedeals. “I don’t need 10 or 15 agreements concluded within oneweek. Rather, I would have this same 10 or 15 agreements deeplythought over, well-negotiated and with concrete signs oflong-term and varied support for Ukraine.”","June 13, 2024 - 12:13"
147,Swiss carbon offset giant pulls plug on Zimbabwe project amid allegations,"Carbon offsets allow firms and individuals to compensate for the carbon emissions they create – through, for example, an airplane flight or a building project – by paying to pull carbon out of the air elsewhere. Voluntary offsets have developed into a billion-dollar global market.South Pole said on Friday that it was not confident the Kariba REDD+ project – owned and developed by Carbon Green Investments (CGI) – met the standards it expected from its partners.The Kariba REDD+ forest conservation project in northern Zimbabwe is one of the world’s largest forest conservation projects. REDD stands for “Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries”.“All activities related to carbon certification and carbon credits from the Kariba REDD+ project will now be the responsibility of CGI, and South Pole’s role as the carbon asset developer has ended,” South Pole said in a statement
External link
on October 27. CGI did not immediately respond to a request for comment made by Reuters.The major REDD+ project has been issued with around 36 million credits since 2011, all intended for removing carbon from the air by preserving the forest. A carbon credit represents a ton of climate-warming carbon dioxide or its equivalent either removed from the atmosphere or prevented from entering it in the first place.South Pole said the carbon credits sold to date maintain their validity, irrespective of South Pole ending its contract with CGI.The Swiss firm’s sudden decision to terminate its partnership comes as the Kariba project and carbon offset schemes more generally have faced mounting criticism and difficulties regarding the integrity of the project and the carbon credits associated with it.Last week the Washington, D.C.-based certification body Verra, the world’s leading carbon standard setter for the offsets market, announced it had launched an investigation into the Kariba project. This follows a critical report published on October 16 by the NewYorker

magazine, entitled “The Great Cash-for-Carbon Hustle”, which claimed South Pole sold millions of credits for carbon reductions that weren’t real.In a statement

, Verra said on October 17 that it had been “deeply disturbed” by the magazine’s allegations, which had “raised serious questions about the carbon-offsetting firm South Pole and the Kariba project in Zimbabwe”. The non-profit certification body said it had launched an investigation into the project, which would remain on hold, along with “any further credit issuances” until the probe is complete.South Pole, which has vehemently denied that it has knowingly sold worthless CO2 certificates, told
External link
Swiss public radio, SRF last week, that it would give full support to Verra’s probe and that the company’s role in the Kariba project would be “actively reviewed” in light of the revelations.Kariba REDD+, which was started in 2011, is one of the world’s first large-scale forest protection projects, designed to conserve 785,000 hectares (1.94 million acres) of woodland in northern Zimbabwe. South Pole’s flagship has been a major beneficiary of carbon credits, as big firms fund projects that claim to remove carbon from the atmosphere to offset their own emissions. Multinationals such as Gucci, Nestlé and Volkswagen have voluntarily offset their emissions by investing in the project, according to Swiss public television SRF.The Kariba project led to the spectacular growth of South Pole, but the Zimbabwe project and carbon offset schemes more generally have faced mounting criticism and difficulties in recent months.

that Gucci had ended its collaboration with South Pole and the forest in Zimbabwe. More widely, an international team of scientists and economists led by the University of Cambridge and VU Amsterdam found that millions of carbon credits are based on crude calculations that inflate the conservation successes of voluntary REDD+ projects. Most carbon offset schemes are significantly overestimating the levels of deforestation they are preventing, the according to the study which was published
External link
in the journal Science in August.Defending his company, South Pole CEO Renat Heuberger told Reuters they had followed the approved methodology for the Kariba project at all times.“There is no other way to do deforestation projects. You cannot know ten years in advance what the deforestation rates will be,” he said in September.Carbon credit certifier Verra, which controls around three-quarters of all voluntary credits worldwide, said it welcomed the scrutiny of the voluntary carbon market by journalists, scientists and environmental groups, while stressing its importance.“It will not be possible to achieve global climate goals without the financing leveraged by the carbon markets, so we must encourage transparency in the markets and commit to continuous improvement,” it said.REDD projects have achieved enormous impact to date, but the system is not perfect, Verra admitted.“The calculation of emission reductions that result from this work is inevitably less clear-cut than in other cases. That is why we are continuously striving to update our REDD and all other methodologies in the Verified Carbon Standard Program to ensure they reflect best practices, the latest science, and our learnings from the past decade,” it said.Until this year, the voluntary carbon market had grown as more companies came under shareholder pressure to adopt net-zero policies. The market was worth around $2 billion in 2021 and Shell and Boston Consulting Group jointly forecast in January that it could reach between $10 billion and $40 billion by 2030. But in September Reuters reported that voluntary carbon markets had shrunk for the first time in at least seven years, as companies reduced buying.Demand for carbon credits is on track to fall in 2023, according to two of the top data providers. The number of credits used by companies fell 6% in the first half of the year, data from BloombergNEF shows. Data from consultancy Ecosystem Marketplace showed a sharper fall of 8% over the same period.“We are moving away from investing in carbon offsets for our brands to invest in programmes and practices that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own supply-chain and operations, where it makes the most difference to reach our net zero ambition,” Nestlé told Reuters.Recent developments appear to have had consequences for staff at South Pole. SRF reported that the firm announced internally two weeks ago that it would have to lay off a fifth of employees due to “a major restructuring”.South Pole refused to comment, telling SRF: “Like every company, we regularly assess whether our global team is sustainably structured and staffed based on market dynamics and demand.” South Pole has around 1,200 employees in over 30 countries.","October 27, 2023 - 15:20"
148,The numbers that shaped debate at WEF 2024,"Participants at the 2024 edition of the WEF braved the elements in Davos with a mix of freezing temperatures, slippery roads and muddy boots throughout the week. But the climate (or rather, the climate crisis) wasn’t what everyone was talking about.Here are the big numbers that shaped debate at the WEF’s 54th annual meeting in Davos.Some 83 countries and international organisations joined talks on peace in Ukraine before the official WEF meeting opened. The number of countries at the table is an achievement in itself, according to Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis who co-chaired the meeting. But it doesn’t mean countries are close to an agreement on a detailed peace plan. A key player, China, wasn’t at the discussion table and according to reports, snubbed an invitation to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos.For Switzerland, the meeting was a reputation boost. The National Security Advisors meeting and the first visit to the country by President Zelensky since the war started a little less than two years ago, marked a potentially more important role for Switzerland in future peace talks. For more details on the potential peace summit, read the story by my colleague Matt Allen.What participants (and taxi drivers) in Davos couldn’t stop talking about though was the traffic anywhere Zelenksy went. His celebrity status and large security entourage stopped traffic multiple times during his visit.There was much ado about Artificial Intelligence at this year’s WEF. There were at least 50 sessions on the official WEF programme that dealt with AI and around 70 that were hosted by the AI House, sponsored by the two Swiss federal technical institutes among others. That doesn’t even cover the sessions up and down the Davos Promenade.A big part of the talk in Davos was on how to govern the technology and ensure it is transparent and inclusive. UN Secretary General António Guterres urged countries to take action soon to counter tech companies who are “pursuing profits with a clear disregard for human rights”.But tech pioneers tried to give a reality check amid all the AI hype. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT, told the WEF audience that AI is “a system that is sometimes right, sometimes creative, often totally wrong”. Meta’s AI research director Yann LeCun also tried to moderate some of the hype around AI telling an audience at the AI House that “we are nowhere near human intelligence” and that he’ll be happy to see “something as intelligent as a cat” by the end of his career.Four heads of state from the Middle East including from Iraq, Jordan, Qatar and Israel were in Davos, putting the war in Gaza and the threat of a wider conflict in the region on the agenda. While there were many calls for a ceasefire, humanitarian aid and a two-state solution, the conflicts in the region were overshadowed by discussions on AI. If any diplomatic breakthroughs were achieved in Davos, it likely did so behind closed doors.The president of Israel told an audience that he doesn’t “deny the human tragedy in Gaza” but that his country has “the right to defend itself” after the October 7 attacks. Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said that attacks on Israel will continue, unless the war in Gaza stops. “An end to the genocide in Gaza will lead to an end of military actions and crises in the region,” he declared.  Even in the context of AI, there was little talk about the use of drones or autonomous weapons and how this will change how wars are fought. One of the most terrifying warnings came from, Stuart Russell, an expert on autonomous weapon. He told an audience at the AI House, that with the help of AI a lethal weapon could be produced for under $20, “making it possible for anyone to have access to a weapon of mass destruction”.The world is set to warm by nearly 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, wreaking havoc on our health, food supply, biodiversity and economies according to a UN report

released in November.These worries didn’t spur the same lofty pledges to tackle climate change as they have at past WEF meetings though. Even US Climate Envoy John Kerry expressed his frustration in one of his many WEF sessions. “I’ve been trying to find a way every day to communicate to people what the urgency really is and why it is we need to take seriously what the scientists and mother nature are telling us.”There were a host of sessions touching on the climate crisis, and a good deal of talk about the need to invest in the energy transition. But there was no one telling companies in Davos the “house is on fire”, like Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg did in 2019. The fact that there were few young people on the streets and on the WEF stages may explain why climate didn’t get as much attention.There’s another reason for the so-called “greenhushing” by companies. “Company leaders may hesitate to put themselves out there because the issue of sustainability has been so politicised,” Patrick Odier, former senior partner at Swiss private bank Lombard Odier and current Chairman of Building Bridges and Swiss Sustainable Finance told SWI on the sidelines of WEF.The WEF’s Chief Economist Outlook painted a gloomy picture for 2024. Economic growth last year was about 3% and is predicted to drop to 2.9% in 2024. Most concerning to many economists in Davos, is that trade, which has been a key engine of growth, has slowed. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine combined with shipping bottlenecks in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal are among the factors slowing trade.Economists also pointed the finger at protectionist measures, which increased 38% in 2023. A key topic of discussion was moves by the US and Europe on semiconductors – the large majority of which are produced in Taiwan. US policymakers had no qualms about citing national security as a key reason to ban the export of chips to China.Europeans also weren’t shy about the need to protect certain industries. “The Europe Chip Act is the first time we said that we need to have a supply chain that is so strategically important,” said Dutch economic minister Monique Adriaansens. “I think Europe should do that more of this when it comes to strategic goods.”This is the number of people heading to the polls this year. More than in any other year in history. Five of the world’s six biggest democracies will hold elections: India, the US, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia.This makes 2024 a real test for AI. A key question discussed at WEF is how AI, chatbots, fake audio and videos could threaten democracy and propagate nationalism, mis- and disinformation. Experts at WEF warned there are growing risks that targeted or personalised messages are used to manipulate voter opinion, and that automated messages with incorrect information spread at a scale never seen before.Cybersecurity and AI systems able to spot fake or manipulative messages spread on the internet will be therefore essential to protect democracies from the threats posed by AI. Investments must be made in day-to-day work to scale down these threats, said Alexandra Reeve Givens, CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. China’s export growth was almost 0% last year, one of many signs its economy is undergoing a transformation. With real estate and manufacturing on the decline, China needs to find a new growth engine, said experts at WEF

.China’s number two, Li Qiang, was on a full charm offensive in Davos, telling a packed audience that “choosing investment in the Chinese market is not a risk, but an opportunity”. Attempting to dispel concerns about a slowing economy, he rattled off a series of good news soundbites such as 5.2% growth in 2023. The real challenge for businesses though said Belen Garijo, CEO of US-based Merck pharmaceuticals in a panel, is balancing national security, resilience and growth. China is a “very attractive business opportunity…but we need reliable rules, fair competition…and a level playing field for international businesses”. That’s the number of women on the official WEF participants list. While a WEF spokesperson said that’s more than at any WEF annual meeting, it represents only 28% of the 2,800 participants. Their presence was especially lacking on the plenary stage. Swiss president Viola Amherd and European Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen were the only women who gave special addresses (out of 10) this year.Despite this, gender equality still made its way into many discussions at WEF. One key reason is that people are starting to wake up to the fact that we need data that reflects the diversity of the world population if we are going to have any chance of removing bias and getting credible answers using AI.This is particularly striking in the health field which has a dearth of data on whether new drugs are safe and work for women in the same way they do for men, said Antonella Santuccione Chadha, who leads the Women’s Brain Project. Addressing the women’s health gap could boost the global economy by at least $1 trillion annually by 2040, according to a report

released at WEF.That’s the amount of graphics processing units (GPUs) of the supercomputer being built in Switzerland. This would make it the largest supercomputer in the world for powering AI models.This gives Swiss scientists access to computing power that is normally in the hands of a few big tech companies, “who control them behind closed doors”, said Antoine Bosselut, head of the natural language processing lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).During WEF, Switzerland also launched an international computation and AI network that aims to make AI technologies accessible globally. “We need to put a system in place where countries who do not benefit from the capabilities and capacities to run AI projects can join those who can,” said Alexandre Fasel, State Secretary of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. That’s how much these trusty reporters paid for a taxi one evening to travel just 7 kilometres. This is three times the “regular” price. While time stuck in traffic can be blamed for some of this, it raises a question about how much price gouging is going on in Davos.Davos-goers lamented the difficulty finding affordable lodging in town. Research by our colleagues at Swiss public radio SRF found apartments for CHF40,000 for 5 nights. Even Alois Zinggli, a managing director at WEF, told the Tages-Anzeiger that he’s seen unbelievable prices

149,A Swiss label wants to make data centres greener,"In January 2017, Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi released a single that would go down in history. In the first six months, the Despacito video clip was viewed 4.6 billion times on YouTube. Today it’s been seen more than eight billion times, but there’s an even more astonishing figure. According to estimates,

the streaming of Despacito consumed more electricity than the power used by 10’000 households in Switzerland in one year.Data centres consumed the most power. They are the buildings containing the servers and physical infrastructure to manage email traffic, store our photos in the cloud – or in this case, run platforms such as YouTube.“Data centres have become the pillars of the digital economy. However, we don’t know how sustainable their energy consumption is,” says Babak Falsafi, professor of computer science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology EPFL in Lausanne and president of the Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association (SDEA), a consortium of companies and academic institutions.According to the International Energy Agency, thousands of data centres and transmission networks worldwide use about two per cent of global electricity

to cool the servers.+Our science newsletter: Swiss research in a global context. Our newsletter presents the latest developments in a bite-size format. Stay curious.With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, Falsafi explains, we are seeing an increase not only in the number and size of data centres, but also in their energy consumption and carbon footprint. But he argues that higher energy efficiency standards could reduce the impact of data centres on the environment and climate.The SDEA presented a new efficiency label in 2020. However, the certification has “really picked up speed” since this year and has gotten “international visibility”, with interest coming from Switzerland as well as other European countries, according to Falsafi. Starting July 16th, all companies operating data centres or renting a space for their servers can register and use the SDEA’s energy efficiency calculator

with the option to eventually apply for certification.The traditional indicator of energy efficiency is the Power Usage Effectiveness
External link
. The PUE measures the electricity consumed by IT infrastructure (compared to the total energy used by the data centre) but gives no indication of how efficiently IT equipment uses that electricity.On the other hand, the SDEA label, which is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE), considers the entire energy balance of a data centre. For example: the CO2 emissions generated by the electricity source and the energy efficiency of servers, storage systems and network devices.The label places special emphasis on the reuse of heat generated by servers. In 2019, only one in three data centres in Switzerland made use of waste heat, according to a study.
External link
The heat could heat nearby buildings and power industrial processes, helping to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.A data centre operator can decide whether to have an independent auditor assess only the building infrastructure, the IT system infrastructure or both. Based on the evaluation report and the established criteria, the SDEA awards a bronze, silver or gold label. The certification is valid for three years. A new assessment after this period encourages participating companies to invest in energy saving measures.So far, the SDEA has awarded the label to three data centres belonging to Hewlett Packard Enterprise (the technology company that initiated the consortium), the financial group SIX and the telecommunications company Swisscom.SIX, which was certified for the whole infrastructure, did not want to disclose the measures taken to improve energy efficiency and the savings achieved. SDEA claims, based on the results of the pilot phase of the project, that implementing the requirements for obtaining the label would save up to 70% of previous energy consumed by a data centre.Another eight data centres are in the process of certification, says Falsafi, without naming the companies involved. Discussions are also currently underway with data centre operators in Austria, Germany and Scandinavia, he says.The SDEA label is a step in the right direction, according to Marco Bettiol, professor at the University of Padua in Italy and author of a study
External link
on the environmental sustainability of data centres. It would allow data centres to precisely measure their impact, including CO2 emissions.But this approach has limitations because it only considers direct emissions. “We cannot underestimate the indirect emissions related to the manufacture of chips and all digital devices used in data centres,” Bettiol points out.A data centre has a lifespan of 15-20 years. But for security reasons, digital equipment is usually replaced every five years on average, he says.With the label, the SDEA also wants to position Switzerland as a reference country for climate-friendly data centres.Switzerland, with its service-oriented economy, political stability and competitive energy costs, is among the countries with the highest number of data centres per capita in the world, according to datacentermap.com

by PricewaterhouseCoopers.Switzerland is particularly well suited to operating data centres in the most environmentally friendly way possible, says Adrian Altenburger, professor of building technology and energy at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and co-author of a study on data centres in Switzerland. He points to the already high share of renewables – around 60% of the electricity generated in Switzerland comes from hydroelectric power plants, and there is potential for expansion.However, this development is not without repercussions.Data centres in Switzerland use almost four per cent of the country’s total electricity

, and in the coming years their electricity consumption will “increase massively”, predicts Altenburger. It cannot be ruled out that the country will have to adopt restrictions on the construction of new data centres to avoid overloading the electricity grid, he warns.In Ireland, where data centres use almost 18% of the country’s electricity

, the national electricity company has introduced a moratorium until 2028 for new facilities in the Dublin area. In the past, Germany, Singapore and China have also imposed restrictions on the development of new data centres.SDEA’s label could help avoid such a scenario and “significantly” improve the efficiency of data centres in Switzerland, says Altenburger. The potential for electricity savings is high: according to a 2021 study

commissioned by the SFOE, data centres in Switzerland could reduce their consumption by 46%.However, Altenburger emphasizes that a voluntary label is not enough to make data centres greener. Regulations or laws that define requirements for energy efficiency are also needed. In the canton of Zurich, the Energy Act of 2023 obliges data centre operators to reuse waste heat.Of course, we can all contribute to reducing the energy consumption of data centres by changing our digital habits

150,"Ukrainian boy badly burned in Russian attack returns to school, music and dance","By Andriy PerunLVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) – Eight-year-old Roman Oleksiv is back at school in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, another step in an unlikely recovery from life-threatening burns and shrapnel to the head that he sustained in a Russian missile attack in July last year.Roman was waiting to see a doctor with his mother when a cruise missile struck the central town of Vinnytsia, in one of the deadliest single attacks since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began early in 2022.She was among 28 people killed, while Roman suffered shrapnel wounds, a broken arm and burns over 45% of his body. After medics in Lviv stabilised him, he was sent to a specialist burns unit in Dresden, Germany, where he spent nearly a year undergoing more than 30 rounds of surgery.He is now back in Lviv, and, while he must return to Dresden regularly for treatment, Roman has begun to settle back into daily life with the help of his father, Yaroslav.“We did not know whether he would be able to walk, move his hand or his fingers,” Yaroslav told Reuters at the school, his hand around Roman’s shoulder. He explained that his son was not in a state to speak to the media yet.“But thanks to their (the medics’) work, to Roman’s work, his superhuman efforts … all this opened the door for us to return to dancing, to playing musical instruments.”Roman is instantly recognisable among the children in the school’s brightly coloured corridors. He wears blue compressive coverings over his head, face and hands for his burns.At a large hall nearby, young contestants wearing bow ties and dresses paired up for the ballroom dance competition.Roman and his partner performed the tango and Charleston, and were warmly cheered as they stepped forward to receive their certificates and medals. Later, Roman performed a solo on the bayan, a version of the accordion.“We went back to practising dancing and the bayan. He went back to school, continues his education,” said Yaroslav. “He is in third grade now.

China, which describes itself as a “near-Arctic” state, also has ambitions there and has said it intended to build a “Polar Silk Road.” China has its eye on mineral resources and new shipping routes as ice packs recede with rising temperatures.“Increasingly, the (People’s Republic of China) and Russia are collaborating in the Arctic across multiple instruments of national power,” the Pentagon’s report said.“While significant areas of disagreement between the PRC and Russia remain, their growing alignment in the region is of concern, and (the Department of Defense) continues to monitor this cooperation,” it added.Arctic sea routes are increasingly being used for connecting major economies across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as global warming shrinks ice packs and allows for longer ice-free periods at sea.China and Russia have been working together to develop Arctic shipping routes as Russia seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western sanctions, while China seeks an alternative shipping route to reduce its dependence on the Strait of Malacca.“China has been participating in Arctic affairs in line with the basic principles of respecting win-win cooperation and sustainable development and has strengthened cooperation with other parties to uphold peace and stability,” Mao Ning, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Tuesday.Security scholars and regional military attaches say China’s reliance on Indian Ocean shipping routes are seen as a strategic vulnerability for Beijing, particularly in a conflict over Taiwan.The Pentagon report added that China was looking to leverage “changing dynamics in the Arctic to pursue greater influence and access, take advantage of Arctic resources, and play a larger role in regional governance.”The report added that the U.S. military had a “monitor-and-respond” strategy in the region that was built on intelligence collection, cooperation with allies and the ability to deploy military assets.This month, the U.S., Canada and Finland will form a consortium to build icebreaker ships, intended to bolster the allies’ shipbuilding and counter Russia and China in increasingly strategic polar regions.The deal – which the three NATO members aim to sign by year-end – will pool demand from allies to scale shipbuilding capacity, the official said, adding that it was designed to send a message to Russia and China.(Reporting by Idrees Ali.

152,Cities demand say in international negotiations,"Cities are important players. “Numerous global issues, from health to human rights, migration to the environment, are negotiated by states at the international level, but often the results are implemented locally,” says Anh Thu Duong, the co-director of the Global Cities Hub in Geneva. The organisation was founded in 2020 by the city and canton of Geneva and the federal government. “We wanted to create a structure that links cities and regions with international Geneva,” Duong says. The Swiss foreign ministry also views it as a positive development. Local and regional governments have been able to acquire a stronger voice thanks to the Global Cities Hub, the ministry said in response to questions.Cities are important where they are in direct contact with the population. With regard to migration, governments decide who is allowed to stay in a country, but local authorities take care of integrating people, providing accommodation and ensuring that children can go to school.Cities have long been speaking out on the international stage on global issues such as climate change and migration. At the UN, however, as subnational authorities they have no consultative status — unlike non-governmental organisations.Cities network internationally in various organisations. However, even United Cities and Local Governments – an organisation bringing together 250,000 member cities worldwide – can only participate in UN negotiations as an NGO. “We see ourselves as a task force that represents all the major city networks,” says Albert Llado, who is responsible for policy and partnerships at UCLG.For example, UCLG is involved in the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which reviews the status of the UN 2030 Development Agenda. In UCLG’s view, these development goals can only be achieved if they are implemented locally. “Local authorities must therefore be given more money, more autonomy and more fields of competence,” Llado says. The organisation is expanding its contacts with governments. According to Llado, meetings between city presidents and the environment ministers of various countries, like those that took place at the UN Climate Change Conference COP28 in Dubai, should be institutionalised. This would make the multilateral system more inclusive, he says.Both Global Cities Hub in Geneva and the UCLG are in favour of a consultative status for cities at the UN. But achieving this is complicated, as UN member states would have to negotiate and adopt a resolution. This is how the consultative status for NGOs was introduced in the 1990s.The member states of the World Health Organisation are currently negotiating a pandemic treaty in Geneva. The Global Cities Hub took part in the meetings, which were open to organisations beyond national governments. “Together with a network of cities, we explained that cities were on the front line during the Covid pandemic,” explains Duong from the Global Cities Hub. Cities implemented measures including lockdowns, school closures and vaccination campaigns. “We therefore demanded that cities be included in the negotiation process and submitted proposals for the agreement,” she says. The Global Cities Hub has also submitted proposals for negotiations on a UN agreement on plastic pollution, she says.The Global Cities Hub is also in favour of cities’ participation in the UN Human Rights Council’s regular review of the human rights situation of states, the Universal Periodic Review. NGOs are already permitted to submit their own reports in these processes. For Switzerland’s most recent Universal Periodic Review in 2022, the federal government consulted the cities for its state report, but they were not represented in the Swiss delegation.To date, Swiss cities have seldom been part of the government delegation at UN conferences. One exception was in 2022, when the association of municipalities took part in the sustainability forum on the UN 2030 Agenda. The foreign ministry says it would welcome cities or cantons carrying out a voluntary local review of the implementation of this agenda. This would enable them to monitor their progress towards the development goals.Internationally, there has been an initial success: in January 2023, the UN Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva decided that the Forum of Mayors would become one of its official bodies. Mayors can discuss global issues that are implemented locally and make recommendations to governments. These issues include sustainable urban development, transport, vulnerable people and adaptation to climate change. Whether the cities will be granted their own consultative status at the UN remains to be seen. They have not yet officially applied for it. Legally speaking, cities are considered part of nation states. However, if they do not agree with their governments, it is currently hard for them to take part in negotiations on global issues. Cities are currently trying to utilise their existing room for manoeuvre and their current activities could pave the way for a formal application.One obstacle to cities having their own status at the UN is that the greater the number of actors involved in decisions, the more complicated negotiations become. This is likely to deter some states. And although cities are only considering consultative status, autocratic governments may view this as a threat to their own power.Cities emphasise their society-wide approach to negotiations as one benefit of giving them their own status. Cities have a different perspective from national governments, are closer to the people and are more likely to know what is happening on the ground, they argue. Giving cities a say would enable better planning and facilitate realistic measures, they say.Edited by Benjamin von Wyl. Adapted from German by Catherine Hickley","March 29, 2024 - 10:30"

154,Stock Rotation Is Back on Bets Fed Will ‘Go Big’: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Wall Street traders revived prospects for a half-point Federal Reserve rate cut this month, driving stocks to their best week in 2024 amid a rotation into companies that would benefit the most from policy easing.Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Economically sensitive shares outperformed the group of tech megacaps that have led the bull market, with the Russell 2000 index of smaller firms climbing 2.5%. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 — where the likes of Nvidia Corp. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — beat the US equity benchmark. That gauge is less impacted by the biggest companies — providing a glimpse of hope the rally will broaden out.As the S&P 500 marched from one record to the next in the first half of the year, some investors grew concerned that only a handful of companies were participating in the rally. Corners of the market outside of big tech are now barreling higher as investors grow more confident that the start of the Fed cutting cycle will further fuel Corporate America.“The biggest news in the last 24 hours has been the shift in odds for a 50 basis-point cut at next week’s Fed meeting,” said Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. “Small-caps offer better risk/reward in the near-term, and we think mega-cap tech likely sees another breather, although it will certainly participate if the S&P 500 makes new highs.”The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, up for a fifth straight day. Its equal-weighted version gained 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.5%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps advanced 0.3%.Treasury two-year yields dropped five basis points to 3.59%. The likelihood of a 50-basis-point move climbed to 40% on Friday, up from as low as 4% earlier in the week. The dollar fell. Gold rose to another record.To Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research, the case for the Fed cutting more agressively next week is strong.“A popular reason to not go 50 is the message it would send: ‘The Fed must know something the rest of us don’t.’ I don’t buy this for a second,” Dutta says. “My own sense is that markets would welcome the move. It is a good thing that the Fed is trying to get onsides quickly.”At JPMorgan Chase & Co., Michael Feroli says he’s sticking with his call that officials will do the “right thing” and cut a half-point.Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities says that while he thinks a 50 basis-point cut is the “right call,” he just can’t see “this Fed — who is so entrenched in backward-looking numbers — getting to 50.” “That is what we think, rather than we want,” Brenner noted.Elias Haddad and Win Thin at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., also believe the Fed is unlikely to slash rates as aggressively as implied by the money market.“First, the US labor market is not falling out of bed. Second, US consumer spending is resilient. Third, underlying inflation is sticky. Fourth, financial conditions are loose,” they said.In the event the Fed decides to go bigger, small caps would get a “significant rally” — and would still rally with a “very dovish 25,” said Eric Johnston at Cantor Fitzgerald.Valuation still seems to favor small caps, and performance did little to move that dial, according to Simeon Hyman at ProShares.“The anticipated Fed rate cut this month could be just the catalyst to realize this valuation-driven opportunity,” he said. “Small-cap interest rate sensitivity is one of the most widely accepted investment tenets, and a Fed rate cut cycle might deliver extra ‘oomph’ to small-caps this time around.”Hyman noted that the rate sensitivity of small-cap stocks is largely attributable to the greater leverage of the cohort versus large firms — smaller companies typically have to borrow more money. “That is clearly true today, with the Russell 2000 having nearly triple the leverage of the S&P 500,” he says. “By itself, that difference is more than sufficient to point to small caps being outsized beneficiaries of rate cuts, as debt burden relief is typically more impactful for them.”While there’s been a broader rotation under the surface of the market away from tech and communications and into more defensive corners, the one issue is that earnings growth at the top end of the market are still expected to exceed the rest of the index, according to Ryan Grabinski at Strategas.“If growth becomes scarce and investors flock to growth, it wouldn’t surprise me to see the largest most liquid names get bid up again,” Grabinski said. “Certainly, they are facing court and regulatory challenges — but to be fair, this is nothing new. Getting too down on the ‘Magnificent Seven’ could pose a major risk to one’s portfolio.”Basically put, with the growth expected from the ‘Mag Seven’, it makes them “difficult to fade,” he concluded.“While cracks are developing in many of the long-time growth leaders, the overall technical picture still shows broader underlying participation than what usually accompanies a cyclical peak,” said Doug Ramsey at The Leuthold Group. “We continue to view this broadening as more likely a sign of a leadership change (from growth to value) than a harbinger of yet another leg higher in the blue-chip averages.”After a couple years of technology stocks leading the market higher, investors in the last two months have shown an appetite for other sectors. As a result, money flew into other corners of the market, including utilities, real estate, industrials and small-cap stocks. The risk is that what seems like a rotation away from tech and artificial intelligence may not be much of one after all.“This rotation has actually caused the death of diversification,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Many investors are adding artificial intelligence-centric stocks in the utilities, industrials and real estate sectors, and incorrectly thinking that they are properly diversified when they are actually still overly exposed to technology themes.”Stock markets are likely to trade sideways until US employment data show clear signs of either weakening or strengthening, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett.A clear direction for jobs would “resolve the autumn ambiguity,” Hartnett wrote in a note, after non-farm payrolls climbed by 142,000 in August, lower than economists’ expectations. “Until then, risk rotates rather than rips or retreats.”Wall Street Gears Up for Fed:If the Fed does a 50 next week, we will likely see a dramatic bull-steepening of the yield curve alongside a bullish yen. Historical evidence points to a 25 being more favorable to risk assets, as a 50 will leave reporters in the room and investors behind their computers wondering if the central bank knows something they don’t.Finally, slow adjustments downward have been more friendly to equities than hasty moves south, with the former more supportive of soft landings and income stability. At the same time, the latter has been associated with economic stress and bottom-line weakness. Judging by price action, investors are certainly looking for a dovish rate decision. This could be in the form of a surprise 50 basis-point cut — or 25 basis-point cut, with a strong hint of at least one 50 basis-point reduction in the remaining two meetings later this year.And this is the issue: Now that market is back pricing as much likelihood on the 50 as 25 basis-point cut out of the gates, then anything but 50 will disappointment market pricing.We maintain that a quarter-point initial cut is the path of least resistance, although it is clear that 50 basis points is on the table and will be part of the Fed’s conversation. We’re cognizant that CPI and PPI are likely to translate into a more benign move in core-PCE. As the Fed’s favored measure, the overall inflation profile will appear less concerning for policymakers and thereby allow the FOMC to focus on the labor market.Given our expectation for the Fed to send a generally dovish tone while delivering a 25bp rate cut to start the cycle, rates can continue to rally and the curve can continue to bull steepen. We favor buying dips in duration.Markets are torn right now between a 25bp cut and 50bp cut next week. We expect 25bp and will be focusing on the new Summary of Economic Projections. As long as inflation stays on a sustained path to 2%, the labor market will be what determines upcoming Fed policy decisions.Corporate Highlights:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","September 13, 2024 - 22:27"
155,Stocks Get Hit as War Jitters Fuel Rush to Bonds: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — The financial world was roiled by a flare-up in geopolitical risks that sent stocks sliding — while spurring a flight to the safest corners of the market such as bonds and the dollar. Oil rose.Equities saw their worst day since January after a news report that Israel was bracing for an attack by Iran on government targets. Approximately 40 launches were identified crossing from Lebanese territory, some of which were intercepted, the Israel Defense Forces wrote in a post on X. US President Joe Biden said he expects Iran will attack Israel sooner rather than later — and his message to Iran is “don’t” do it.Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — spiked to levels last seen in October.To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, investors have been much too complacent about geopolitical issues.“Since gold and oil have been pricing in a meaningful impact on the marketplace from this crisis, it’s not out of the question that the stock market will follow those other markets and see an outsized reaction before long,” Maley noted.The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Friday, with banks and chipmakers leading losses. The gauge posted its biggest weekly drop in 2024. Treasury 10-year yields sank seven basis points to 4.52%. Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities also cited “massive short covering” and rate locking before an expected flurry of debt issuance by banks after earnings.The dollar notched its best week since September 2022. Brent oil settled above $90. Gold topped the $2,400-an-ounce mark before erasing gains.As Iran Threatens Attack, These Are Israel’s Defenses: QuickTakeTreasuries rallied sharply, following the market’s worst two days since February, in which yields reached year-to-date highs after inflation readings savaged expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Two-year yields — which briefly topped 5% this week — plunged on Friday.“Risk was off the menu on Friday,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “Investors were lighting up on risk exposure ahead of the weekend, fearing risk assets could gap lower should something happen.”A direct confrontation between Israel and Iran would mean a significant escalation of the Middle East conflict and would lead to a significant rise in oil prices, according to Commerzbank analysts including Carsten Fritsch.Escalating geopolitical tensions — most recently in the Middle East, but also including attacks on Russian energy infrastructure by Ukraine — have spurred bullish activity in the oil options market. There’s been elevated buying of call options — which profit when prices rise — in recent days, with implied volatility jumping.Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers says the latest developments illustrate how investor sentiment and high equity valuations are vulnerable to geopolitical conflicts, persistent inflation and oil prices. “Investors have pushed back their expectations for the start of the Fed’s easing cycle — with geopolitics possibly replacing the Fed as one of the market’s top volatility influencers,” he noted.As Wall Street’s earnings season kicked off, big banks’ results offered the latest window into how the US economy is faring amid an interest-rate trajectory muddied by persistent inflation. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. both reported net interest income — the earnings they generate from lending — that missed estimates amid increasing funding costs. Citigroup Inc.’s profit topped forecasts as corporations tapped markets for financing and consumers leaned on credit cards.“Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,” JPMorgan’s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. He cited the wars, growing geopolitical tensions, persistent inflationary pressures and the effects of quantitative tightening.Meantime, the latest economic data did little to alter the reduced risk appetite on Friday — with consumer sentiment down as inflation expectations rose.BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he expects the Fed to cut rates twice at the most this year, and that it will be difficult for the central bank to curb inflation. Fink told CNBC he would “call it a day and a win” if the inflation rate gets to between 2.8% and 3%, which is above the Fed’s 2% target.Pacific Investment Management Co. warned that the Fed could pivot back toward interest rate hikes if US inflation moves higher — with the asset manager preferring to buy bonds in other markets.“If inflation starts to re-emerge then there’s a possibility that the Fed hikes instead of delivering any cuts,” Mohit Mittal, chief investment officer for core strategies at Pimco, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Fedspeak. A slew of officials emphasized Friday that there is no urgency to lower interest rates, pointing to still-elevated inflation and a robust labor market.That included comments from both the Boston Fed’s Susan Collins as well as San Francisco’s Mary Daly. Atlanta’s Raphael Bostic repeated his view for one rate cut toward the end of the year, and Kansas City’s Jeffrey Schmid noted he prefers a “patient” approach to reductions. While shifting expectations around the timing and pace of the first cuts are likely to create further yield volatility in the near term, UBS’s Chief Investment Office thinks the more important point is that the US central bank remains set to start easing this year. With a low probability of the Fed needing to hike rates further, CIO maintains their positive outlook on quality bonds.“We continue to favor quality bonds in our global portfolios and recommend investors lock in attractive yields before rates fall this year,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We like those with 1–10-year duration, as well as sustainable bonds.” “We also think investors should consider an active exposure to fixed income to improve diversification,” she concluded.Corporate Highlights:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Alex Longley, Jack Wittels, Julia Fanzeres, Jack Ryan, Sybilla Gross, Caleb Mutua, Carter Johnson, Michael Mackenzie and Isabelle Lee.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","April 12, 2024 - 22:55"
156,Climate finance in the spotlight at COP28 climate talks,"By Simon Jessop, Hadeel Al Sayegh and Yousef SabaDUBAI (Reuters) -Money pledges stacked up at COP28 in Dubai on Monday as delegates sought to address the huge gap between what is needed in climate finance and the amounts so far on offer.The United Arab Emirates, the host of this year’s conference, pledged to mobilise $270 billion in green finance by 2030 through its banks, and several development banks announced plans to increase their funding efforts, including by agreeing to pause debt repayments if a climate-related disaster hits.But leaders of the region’s biggest economy and biggest OPEC oil producer Saudi Arabia have so far not attended the U.N. summit, in contrast to their participation in last year’s COP27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.On Monday, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, energy minister and the key climate negotiator, for the kingdom, was a no-show at the Saudi Green Initiative, a side event showcasing the country’s clean energy plans.De facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman also did not deliver a speech to world leaders as scheduled on Friday.As tensions ran high over differing visions for the future of fossil fuels, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber defended his role after the Guardian newspaper quoted him as questioning the science behind the need to “phase out” fossil fuels.Al Jaber has also drawn criticism linked to his role as CEO of ADNOC, the UAE’s state-owned oil company.“I am quite surprised with the constant and repeated attempts to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency,” Al Jaber told a news conference. “We very much believe and respect the science.”VAST NEEDSThe amount of cash needed for the energy transition, climate adaptation and disaster relief is overwhelming.A report released on Monday estimated that emerging markets and developing countries will need $2.4 trillion a year in investment to cap emissions and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.“The world is not on track to realise the goals of the Paris Agreement. The reason for this failure is a lack of investment, particularly in emerging market and developing countries outside China,” said co-author Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.The 2015 the Paris conference set a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while aiming for a cap of 1.5C.“The central challenge is to accelerate and implement the fostering and financing of this investment from a range of sources,” Stern said.Vulnerable countries that are already being hit by costly climate disasters are asking for billions more through a newly formed disaster fund. Pledges to the fund so far total around $700 million.“Unless we have an urgent set of decision-making, we are going to suffer what every parent suffers from – exciting expectations and being unable to deliver,” said Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, a prominent voice in global discussions about mobilising climate finance.In a news conference, she urged countries to go beyond voluntary pledges and pleas to charities and private investors and instead consider taxes as a way to boost climate funding.A global 0.1% tax on financial services, for example, could raise $420 billion, she said, while a 5% tax on global oil and gas profits in 2022 would have yielded around $200 billion.“The planet needs global governance not in a big stick way, but in a simple way of us cooperating with each other to be able to work with the institutions that we have,” she added.Other delegates, including U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, have called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies which have hit a record $7 trillion per year.Activists with the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development said they worried the sums pledged would be inadequate.“The climate finance that they have pledged at this COP28 is simply not enough,” said Pakistani activist Zaigham Abbas, whose country was devastated last year by flooding. “We are not looking for charity here … The scale of the catastrophe that we are staring at is unprecedented.”MOVING MONEYThe biggest pledge on Monday came from the UAE’s banking system, joining peers in other regions in pledging to lend more to green projects. It followed a pledge on Friday of $30 billion for climate-related projects from the oil producing Gulf state.Elsewhere, France and Japan said they would support an African Development Bank drive to leverage IMF Special Drawing Rights for climate and development.The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, meanwhile, said it would include climate resilient debt clauses in new loan deals with some poorer countries.Danish investment firm Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners announced plans to raise $3 billion for renewable projects in emerging markets.This year is marked by the biggest representation of business yet at the annual U.N. summit, fostering hopes for more private investment toward climate causes.The emirate of Abu Dhabi teamed up with private sector partners including BlackRock and HSBC to launch a climate research and advisory hub to boost financing options in the region.“The scale of the climate crisis demands urgent and game-changing solutions from every industry,” Jaber said. “Finance plays a critical role in turning our ambitions into actions.”For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here.(Reporting by Simon Jessop, Yousef Saba, Maha El Dahan and Hadeel Al Sayegh; Additional reporting by Alexander Cornwell, Elizabeth Piper and David Stanway; Editing by Katy Daigle, Miral Fahmy and Barbara Lewis)","December 4, 2023 - 16:05"

158,Prince Harry says travel industry must do more for local communities,"LONDON (Reuters) – Britain’s Prince Harry said it was crucial the travel industry did better by the local communities in vacation destinations or there would be no tourism business at all in the future.Speaking at the annual general meeting of Travalyst, an initiative he launched in 2019 with the aim of making the travel industry more sustainable, King Charles’ son said it was crucial to do more for those on whom the industry depended.“Travel and tourism relies on destinations, held together by communities, without which we have nowhere to travel to,” said Harry, who appeared by videolink from his home in California.“Communities are the beating heart of travel, and we must do better by the people who are the custodians of the places we visit.”The Travalyst scheme, an independent non-profit body backed by major tourism industry companies including Google, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Expedia, aims to help travellers to cut their carbon emissions, prevent over-tourism and develop local economies.Like his father, who has spoken out for more than 50 years on issues such as sustainability and climate change, Harry has also been a vocal champion of environmental causes.However, he and his wife Meghan have faced accusations of hypocrisy for taking private jets to attend engagements. The prince has previously said he only did so occasionally or in certain circumstances where he needed to keep his family safe, and that he always offsets his carbon dioxide emissions.Harry founded Travalyst before he and his wife – the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – stepped down from their official royal roles in 2020, and since then they have embarked on a number of projects.This week Meghan launched her new lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard, sending jars of strawberry jam to a small number of selected recipients.Earlier this month, the couple announced they would produce two more Netflix shows that will focus on cooking and a U.S. polo championship.","April 17, 2024 - 12:55"
159,"Pope Francis, in Singapore, urges fair wages for migrant workers","By Joshua McElweeSINGAPORE (Reuters) -Pope Francis on Thursday urged political leaders in Singapore, a leading global financial hub, to seek fair wages for the country’s million-plus lower-paid foreign workers.In likely the last major speech of an ambitious 12-day tour across Southeast Asia and Oceania, the 87-year-old pontiff expressed concern for Singapore’s rapidly ageing population and its migrant workforce, centred in the construction and domestic services industries.“I hope that special attention will be paid to the poor and the elderly … as well as to protecting the dignity of migrant workers,” the pope said in an address to about 1,000 politicians and civil and religious leaders.“These workers contribute a great deal to society and should be guaranteed a fair wage,” he said.There were 1.1 million foreigners on work permits in Singapore who earned less than S$3,000 ($2,300) per month as of December 2023, including 286,300 domestic workers and 441,100 workers in the construction, shipyard and process sectors, government data shows.Many of the migrant workers come from nearby countries such as Malaysia, China, Bangladesh and India. Many also come from the Philippines, a majority Catholic country.A Singapore NGO that provides services for migrant workers, Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, welcomed the pope’s remarks, saying they were in “full agreement” with his call for fair wages.Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower said in emailed comments that wages were set by the free market and the government did not prescribe minimum wages for workers in the country.“Our employment laws are complemented by rigorous enforcement to ensure that our migrant workers are properly and fairly treated, and their employment rights and well-being protected,” the ministry said.Concern for migrants has been a common theme for Francis. Earlier on his trip, he asked leaders in Papua New Guinea to work for fair wages as that country becomes a major target of international companies for its gas, gold and other reserves.‘EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW’Francis’ speech came after private meetings with President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at the country’s parliament building, where the pope was presented with a white orchid plant, a new hybrid that was named in his honour.Francis praised Singapore’s efforts to confront climate change, calling them a model for other countries.Singapore’s government says rising sea levels due to global warming could have major implications for its low-lying coastline and it is planning to spend S$100 billion ($77 billion) over the course of the century on the issue.“Your commitment to sustainable development and the preservation of creation is an example to follow,” the pope said.    Francis, who has prioritised trips to places never visited by a pope, or where Catholics are a small minority, is only the second pope to visit Singapore, following a brief 5-hour layover by the late John Paul II in 1986.Singapore, with a population of 5.92 million, is plurality Buddhist, with about 31% of people identifying with that faith. The Vatican counts about 210,000 Catholics in the country, although that number is higher if foreign workers are included.There are also strong Muslim, Hindu and Taoist communities, and Francis praised Singapore as “a mosaic of ethnicities, cultures and religions living together in harmony”.HONG KONG PRESENCEFrancis celebrated a Mass the Vatican said drew some 50,000 people to Singapore’s national sports stadium, a venue that has also hosted performers such as Taylor Swift, who played six concerts there in March.People queued outside the stadium, under tight security measures, at least five hours before the start of the event.Connie Rodriguez, a Filipino Catholic in Singapore, said it was “overwhelming” to see the pope. “You really feel so blessed,” she said.Francis toured the stadium at the beginning of the event in a white golf cart decorated with the Vatican seal. He greeted dozens of schoolchildren, babies, and disabled people. He also took a few selfies.Among those who attended the Mass, which featured a prayer in Mandarin, were Catholics who travelled from Hong Kong for the event, including the territory’s archbishop, Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan.The Vatican is currently renegotiating a controversial deal with China over the appointment of Catholic bishops in the country, which is up for renewal in October.Francis’ 12-day tour has also included stops in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor.

160,"Biden, Zelenskiy inch toward NATO with 10-year defense agreement","By Andrea ShalalBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement on Thursday aimed at bolstering Ukraine’s defense against Russian invaders and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.The deal, signed on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy, aims to commit future U.S. administrations to support Ukraine, even if former President Donald Trump wins November’s election, officials said.“Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” Biden said at a joint news conference with Zelenskiy.He said the G7’s message to Russian President Vladimir Putin is “You cannot wait us out. You cannot divide us.” The group of rich nations also agreed to a $50 billion loan for Ukraine backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.The U.S.-Ukraine security deal is a framework for a long-term effort to help develop Ukraine’s outdated armed forces and serve as a step towards Ukraine’s eventual NATO membership, according to the text.The Ukraine president called the agreement historic, saying it is a bridge toward his country’s eventual NATO membership. “This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life,” he said.Zelenskiy has long sought NATO membership but the allies have stopped short of taking that step. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause.In the event of an armed attack or threat of such against Ukraine, top U.S. and Ukrainian officials will meet within 24 hours to consult on a response and determine what additional defense needs are required for Ukraine, the agreement says.Under the agreement, the United States restates its support for Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, amid a renewed push by Russia on Ukraine’s eastern front.It also outlines plans to develop Ukraine’s own defense industry and expand its military.Ukraine needs a “significant” military force and sustained investments in its defense industrial base consistent with NATO standards, the text says.It will allow the two countries to share intelligence, hold training and military education programs and combined military and exercises.With Trump leading Biden in many election polls, the future of the agreement remains unclear.Trump has expressed skepticism of Ukraine’s continued fight, saying at one point that he would end the conflict in his first day in office. Trump has also pushed for Europe to take on more of the burden of supporting Kyiv.Zelenskiy, asked about what could happen for his country if there is a change in leadership in the United States and in other allied nations, said people stood with Ukraine because they have shared values and empathize with the Ukrainian people.He said he does not think that popular support will change.“If the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,” he said.Biden recently shifted his policy against allowing Ukraine to use American weapons for attacks inside Russia, permitting Kyiv to fire long-range U.S. missiles against Russian targets near the embattled Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.At the news conference, Biden made clear he would not permit Ukraine to expand its use of U.S. missiles inside Russia.“It makes a lot of sense for Ukraine to be able to take out or combat what is going across that border. In terms of long range weapons … we have not changed our position on that,” Biden said.(Writing by Steve Holland; Editing by Heather Timmons, Chizu Nomiyama and Alistair Bell)","June 14, 2024 - 00:47"
161,Former CERN head has served science and peace for 100 years,"How many centenarians have had face-to-face discussions with countless heads of state and religious leaders, made possible several major scientific discoveries and diplomatic collaborations, and asked you to confirm by email the time of an interview because “their schedule is filling up fast”?When we arrive in the Geneva countryside and sit down with German physicist Herwig Schopper, whose eyes still sparkle with energy and curiosity, it quickly becomes clear that a century of life experience also teaches you how to tell an entertaining story.Watch: Herwig Schopper talks about the World Wide Web and his meetings with Margaret Thatcher and Pope John Paul II:In 1981, when Schopper took the helm of the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN), he first had to tackle the basics: money. He restructured the laboratory’s financial system by introducing a fixed annual budget and funding experiments through member countries. He was also the organisation’s first director general, assuming the workload of what had been two separate positions.“I often complained that I had to do the work of two director generals,” he recalls.Schopper then helped bring about one of the most ambitious scientific projects of all time: the construction of the 27-kilometre underground circular tunnel that would house the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP). It would later house the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), today the world’s most powerful particle accelerator and the most sophisticated machine ever created. Scientists are using it to learn about the fundamental particles that make up the universe. The last such particle discovered was the Higgs boson in 2012.Closest to Schopper’s heart is another particle discovery: that of the W and Z bosons.Confirmation of their existence came about through the UA1 experiment, conceived and directed by Italian physicist Carlo Rubbia. The international experiment “brought together about 200 people”, Schopper recalls, pointing out that this was revolutionary compared to the small research groups of a dozen people that had previously defined high-energy physics. For our benefit, he does not go into too much technical detail. He simply explains that the discovery of the W and Z bosons confirmed the presence of so-called weak nuclear interactions, one of the forces underlying the standard models of quantum physics. “It’s one of the most important forces in nature, without which there would be no energy production in the Sun and we would not have sunlight,” he says.Rubbia won the Nobel Prize just a year after the groundbreaking results were published, along with  Simon van der Meer, who invented the method to get a sufficient amount of collisions allowing for the particles’ detection.When a Nobel delegation approached Schopper to inform him of the decision, he was pleased but felt the prize should have highlighted the collective effort of hundreds of people involved in the experiment. But Alfred Nobel’s will stipulates that a maximum of three people can be honoured with his namesake prize.That’s why Schopper believes the Nobel Prize is no longer in line with the development of modern science. “It’s not appropriate in this day and age to limit such a prestigious prize to only three people because not only in particle physics, but also in other areas of science, cooperation is essential,” he says.Collaboration is one of the pillars on which CERN was founded, the other being the creation of a hub of scientific excellence capable of competing with the United States. True collaboration required bringing together countries that, until a few years previously, had still been at war with each other. “Science for peace, as it was called in those days,” Schopper recalls.Schopper internalised CERN’s mission of collaboration as few others would. When he left the centre’s directorship in 1988, he continued to work in the field that is now called science diplomacy.“I wanted to use CERN’s reputation and success to help bring countries together,” he says.His first initiative materialised in Jordan in 2017 with the opening of the lab known as SESAME, “the word that opens doors in One Thousand and One Nights”, Schopper explains. He insisted on a name that meant something in different cultures instead of “an acronym like CERN where no one knows what it means”, he says with a smile. (SESAME also stands for something: Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East).Under the patronage of UNESCO, SESAME and its particle accelerator function under the same model as CERN, with one scientist and one government representative from each of the member countries on its governing body.Currently the member countries are Jordan, Cyprus, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Yes, you read that correctly. Schopper says SESAME is the only organisation where he has been able to see representatives of Israel and Iran sitting around the same table peacefully discussing project issues.“Believe it or not, even with today’s difficulties in the Middle East, this workshop still exists,” he says. “There are all kinds of problems because of the political situation, but doing physics and working together peacefully works.”Schopper hopes to achieve similar results through his other major project: the construction of a technology and science research centre in the Balkan region, not exactly known for good neighbourly relations.Confronted with the problem of finding an umbrella organisation to sponsor the project, as the UN’s culture office UNESCO did for SESAME, Schopper turned to Switzerland. In doing so, he recalled the country’s long tradition of multilateralism, with the founding of organisations such as the Red Cross. Over lunch in 2019, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis agreed to lend a hand.Switzerland’s foreign ministry set about facilitating discussions among Balkan states that could one day lead to the creation of – perhaps to Schopper’s chagrin – another scientific collaboration with a not-so-elegant acronym: SEEIIST

, or the South East European International Institute for Sustainable Technologies.Schopper also appreciates Switzerland for the role that Geneva has played in enabling scientific collaboration at CERN. He says that those who chose Geneva as CERN’s home could never have predicted the importance of that decision.The city’s good connections and central location are an advantage, Schopper says. But even more important are Geneva’s “magnificent” cultural environment, the lake, the mountains, and its international character. “After all, physicists are also human beings with families,” he points out, adding that “a competing CERN project to build a particle accelerator in Texas failed because it was in the middle of a desert. Who wants to go and live in a desert?”Geneva’s advantageous location is one of the arguments that CERN’s current director, Italy’s Fabiola Gianotti, may leverage to move forward construction of the new Future Circular Collider (FCC), a mammoth particle accelerator in a 91-kilometre underground tunnel that will allow a sevenfold increase of the collision energies of the LHC.Schopper is closely following the project’s developments, which remind him of the obstacles he had to overcome when building the LEP some 40 years ago.The most difficult challenge, he says, is explaining what benefits fundamental research can offer society. It will take decades before it shows results, let alone a product that can be commercialised. There is one perfect example, he says: the World Wide Web.The seed from which the modern-day internet developed was conceived in the 1980s to facilitate CERN’s work to transfer data from experiments to universities around the world more efficiently.When Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, approached Schopper to tell him about his invention and perhaps patent it in CERN’s name, the director sought all the expert opinions he could.“I asked in Geneva, in Brussels,” he recalls. “They all said, ‘No, it’s an interesting network only for you physicists.’” Schopper told Berners-Lee that he could do what he liked with his invention.“Eventually, he went to the United States, where they were smart enough to commercialise it,” Schopper says.Today, the former CERN director doesn’t seem upset by the oversight. What matters to him after 100 years of life experience is something else.“Without science, what would we tell our children? That the Earth is about 4,000 years old, that the Sun moves around it,” he says. “What is being done and has been done at CERN for the last 50 to 60 years, on the other hand, will be taught in schools very soon.”Edited by Sabrina Weiss and Veronica DeVore/ts","March 17, 2024 - 10:30"
162,Space systems graduate programme takes off at ETH Zurich,"+ Get the most important Swiss news directly in your inboxThe programme is led by the former head of research at NASA, Thomas Zurbuchen. The Bern-born professor is convinced that Switzerland can help shape the future of space exploration.The pioneering class is relatively small. Only 28 students were selected among the 95 applications from engineers and scientists who held a Swiss diploma – a prerequisite for this first intake. The programme will open to international graduates in the autumn of 2025, with applications possible from November 2024. The university anticipates a significant increase in applications, especially from international candidates.Students on the four-semester programme will gain a comprehensive understanding of space systems, including satellites, launch vehicles, telescopes, and spacecraft. In addition, they will study the fundamentals of Earth and planetary sciences, as well as astrophysics. For more specialised focus, students can choose to dive deeper into areas such as space engineering, space communication, robotics, Earth observation, or planetary sciences.The aim of the course is to harness Swiss expertise in the field of space, explained the former associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA.“We have adapted this master’s programme specifically for Switzerland. We focus on sustainability and data analysis, which are really Swiss specialities, where we are better than most, and also on systems,” explained Zurcher.The programme has generated great interest among young people. “I studied physics, so I have a good basic knowledge of space. But being able to understand exactly how a satellite is built and how to plan a mission is a really great opportunity,” says student Audrey Aebi.According to ETH Zurich, the space industry is growing and urgently needs skilled workers. “Global investment in the space industry amounts to more than $500 billion and is expected to triple by 2040,” it says on its website.The course is also designed to meet the needs of Swiss companies, “many of which build parts for satellites but only one or two of which are able to assemble them”, explains Zurbuchen.“The companies tell us they need more people who really understand where their parts are used,” he adds.Around 30 companies have participated in the development of the course. Going forward, ETH Zurich also intends to strengthen its collaboration on space systems research with the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).“Here, you learn all about space: what it will be like in the next few years, how you can learn to work in a team,” says student Chloé Pilloud, who dreams of becoming Switzerland’s first female astronaut.Teamwork is essential in the space industry, stresses Zurbuchen. It is not enough to have excellent grades to enter this course. “We want students who are passionate about space, people who have new ideas and can really make an impact,” he says.“No satellite has ever been built by a single person,” he adds. “It’s teams that build satellites. So we want people who can work together.”Adapted from French with DeepL/sb","October 8, 2024 - 11:00"

Her death has put the spotlight on domestic violence in the East African country, particularly within its running community.“This guy is dead because he killed my daughter. He has died because of his actions,” Cheptegei’s father, Joseph Cheptegei, told Reuters.Rights groups say female athletes in Kenya, where many international runners train in the high-altitude highlands, are at a high risk of exploitation and violence at the hands of men drawn to their prize money, which far exceeds local incomes.“Justice really would have been for him to sit in jail and think about what he had done. This is not positive news whatsoever,” said Viola Cheptoo, co-founder of Tirop’s Angels, a support group for survivors of domestic violence in Kenya’s athletic community.“The shock of Rebecca’s death is still fresh,” Cheptoo told Reuters.Cheptoo co-founded Tirop’s Angels in memory of Agnes Tirop, a rising star in Kenya’s highly competitive athletics scene, who was found dead in her home in the town of Iten in October 2021, with multiple stab wounds to the neck.Ibrahim Rotich, Tirop’s husband, was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty.

167,Explainer: Why Switzerland remains a ‘big buyer’ of Russian gold  ,"Gold plays a crucial role in Russia’s economy, especially as the country navigates international sanctions over its war on Ukraine. Despite facing over 16,000 sanctions across strategic sectors, the Russian economy has shown resilience, registering a notable growth rate of 3.6% in 2023. This year the economy grew 5.4% in the first quarter and 4% in the second, according to official figures.Russia is the second-largest gold producer in the world, contributing around 10% of global output. The gold industry remains strong, with seven large mining projects underway and a projected 4% annual increase in production until 2026, according to mining industry reports. This production supports the war-time economy as Russia exports gold to countries that did not impose sanctions.Gold serves as a hedge against political risks and global financial turbulence. For Russia, gold reserves have been a strategic asset, helping to maintain economic stability amid sanctions. Russia has been trying to distance its economy from the US dollar for a decade by making more trade payments in other currencies. Facing sanctions, the Russian government expressed in early 2022 its intention to link the rouble to gold. The BRIC economies

have been exploring a common currency backed by a basket of commodities including gold.  Global central bank demand for gold began an upward swing in 2022, propelling the price of gold to a series of record-shattering highs. The shiny metal hit its all-time highest price of $2,530.30 (CHF2,150) per troy ounce on August 20, 2024. This has been great news for Russia.International sanctions, including those from Switzerland, prohibit the import of Russian gold produced after the war began. These sanctions aim to limit Russia’s ability to finance its war effort in Ukraine. However, enforcement of these sanctions is complex.Swiss sanctions on Russian gold came into effect on August 3, 2022. Refineries quickly sought guidance
External link
from the Swiss government on how to ensure that gold originating from Russia and exported to the EU or a third country is not imported into Switzerland. Companies do the heavy lifting on due diligence with the help of auditors. Swiss customs have the power to inspect the flow of gold for potential violations and to bring cases to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) for further investigation.“If there are indications or suspicions of a violation of sanctions law, SECO will systematically investigate,” SECO told SWI swissinfo.ch in an email.  Authorities state that Switzerland’s imports of Russian gold have so far been compliant with sanctions. “The Federal Office for Customs and Border Security inspected the imports and found no violations of the applicable sanctions,” it said in response to written questions from SWI swissinfo.ch on the latest Russian gold import figures.Gold of Russian origin continues to make its way into Switzerland largely because the gold imported is from stocks stored in London vaults before the Ukraine conflict. These stocks are not covered by current sanctions, allowing Swiss refineries to legally source and process this gold.The significant increase in Swiss imports of Russian gold from 17.5 tonnes in 2021 to 63.4 tonnes in 2023 reflects this ongoing trade. However, the nature of these imports raises concerns about potential “gold laundering”, where the origin of the gold is obscured once it is processed by refineries.The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), the standard-setting body for the global wholesale market for precious metals, used to have six Russian refineries among its members. As a result, London vaults filled up over the years with bars of Russian gold, which were widely valued by the gold industry for their high level of refinement.The Russian refineries were suspended by the LBMA on March 7, 2022 – just weeks after the start of the war.“When sanctions came out globally, we had already suspended our Russian refiners. But there were existing stocks,” explains LBMA Chief Executive Ruth Crowell. “Part of [the challenge] is demonstrating, particularly the older stocks, that they have been sitting outside in a secure vault well before those sanctions were put in place.”The amount of gold being imported into Switzerland from London and identified as Russian origin suggests that these older stocks represent substantial volumes. “We don’t know the exact quantity of Russian gold in London vaults,” says Marc Ummel, head of the raw materials unit of Swissaid.Swiss imports of Russian gold shifted from 2022 to 2023, with gold refineries overtaking financial institutions as the main buyers. Customs data shows refineries and financial institutions bought Russian gold in comparable, relatively low amounts in 2021. In 2023, refineries bought almost twice as much gold as financial institutions.“This is related to the fact that as the war continues, no one wants to have Russian gold in their funds, particularly some ETFs [exchange-traded funds, a type of investment fund] which give more information and are more transparent [than refiners] about where the gold they have in their fund comes from,” explains Ummel. “When it goes to a refinery, you just change the origin of the gold. It’s a kind of laundering of the gold.”Refining bars of any origin in Switzerland gives them the Swiss stamp of approval and it becomes impossible to ascertain where the gold originated from.Buying gold that was mined and refined in Russia before the war is legal. But the difficulties ascertaining the origin of gold – which can be refined and re-refined, thus removing any indications of its real origin – adds up to reputational risks and compliance headaches that many actors in the gold industry would rather avoid, and so they stopped sourcing Russian gold altogether.Russian gold has been primarily rerouted to Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to media reports and industry sources.The United Nations Comtrade database does not have export data for Russia beyond 2021.Import data submitted by countries to Comtrade paint a partial picture of these gold flows. They show, for example, that the United Kingdom was a top importer of Russian gold in 2021 but scaled back in 2022, presumably as sanctions took effect. The UK declared importing 264.2 tonnes of Russian gold in 2021 and only 42.5 tonnes in 2022. The UK declared no gold imports from Russia in 2023.Available import figures on the same database so far show that Hong Kong topped the list in 2023, buying 82.2 tonnes of Russian gold. That compares to just 10.6 tonnes in 2022 and 1.5 tonnes in 2021. Imports of Russian gold into the UAE rose to 96.4 tonnes in 2022, up from 6.1 tonnes in 2021. The UAE’s import figures for 2023 are yet to be published by Comtrade.Armenia became a top buyer of Russian gold in 2023, importing 34.3 tonnes that year compared to 1.2 tonnes in 2021 and 4.4 tonnes in 2022. The database does not differentiate between gold that was imported directly from Russia or purchases of Russian gold made in a third country.The issue of Russian gold has spurred calls for greater transparency and efforts towards more rigorous tracking of gold as a commodity. The LBMA gets data from its refineries manually on an annual basis and from vaults monthly. The war on Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russia pushed the gold body to make an inventory of Russian bars stored in London.The LBMA announced at its Sustainability and Responsible Sourcing Summit in March the appointment of Swiss company aXedras as the official provider for its newly established Gold Bar Integrity (GBI) database, set to launch later in 2024. The database will help the market authority see and crunch the numbers in real time.One of the use cases of the platform developed by aXedras, which Swiss refineries are embracing, is to efficiently demonstrate compliance with sanctions.Swiss customs authorities rely on truthful declarations of origin. As part of their risk-based control activities, customs can determine the country of origin of the gold based on the attached documents or melting marks on the bars. Suspected violations of Swiss laws or sanctions are then reported to SECO.
 
“We have to be careful with the data because it is possible that it is not so precise,” cautions Ummel in reaction to Swiss customs data on Russia gold imports. “The loopholes are at different levels. What people declare here can be questionable.” He also notes transporters bringing gold of different origins from the United Kingdom sometimes just declare the biggest origin of the lot. While Swiss authorities claim compliance with sanctions, the potential for newly mined Russian gold to enter Switzerland through third countries remains a significant concern. Experts assess there is a higher risk of post-war Russian gold reaching Switzerland through the UAE or Hong Kong than the UK. These two nations are major importers of Russian gold, whereas London ceased its imports of Russian gold after the war.Russia, one of the most-sanctioned countries in the world, has proven adept at evading sanctions. The inability of sanctions to bring about a change in Russia’s behaviour raises questions about their enforcement and effectiveness in Western corridors of power. In the UK, the Treasury Committee initiated an inquiry this year to assess whether its economic sanctions effectively hinder the war effort.When asked if a similar assessment was warranted or in progress in Switzerland, SECO outlined the achievements of the sanctions so far. It highlighted that the efforts of sanctioning states had led to the immobilisation of CHF253 billion ($297 billion) worth of assets belonging to the Russian central bank. Russian tax revenues from oil and gas have also significantly declined in 2023 compared to the previous year.Russia has used up roughly a third to half of the remaining liquid assets in its National Welfare Fund to cover last year’s budget deficit, according to SECO. The same source also stated that it is highly unlikely that Russian imports of key components will be able to meet the demand for the production of Russian military technology. It concluded that Russian arms production had been significantly impacted by the sanctions.In March 2023, a Swiss parliamentary motion was made to address potential loopholes related to the trade of Russian gold. This motion was a response to concerns that subsidiaries of commodity traders abroad are being utilised to trade Russian gold and evade Russian sanctions. A Financial Times investigation drew attention to the activities of Open Mineral Ltd, a company registered in Abu Dhabi and owned by Zug-based Open Mineral AG.+ Swiss-owned company’s Russian gold trades expose gap in western sanctionsThe Swiss government rejected that motion. It justified its decision by noting that the territorial scope is not explicitly regulated in the Embargo Act, and Swiss law typically covers situations within its own territory.“It must be assessed on a case-by-case basis to what extent acts committed abroad fall under Swiss jurisdiction and thus under the sanctions provisions of Switzerland,” the government noted. “Possible links to Swiss jurisdiction exist, for example, if payments or instructions – prohibited by the sanctions – are made from Switzerland.

The Swiss government has also been tasked with presenting a report on sanction compliance and deficiencies in the raw materials sector. This is due to the fact that about 50-60% of Russian oil and 75% of coal exported by Russia is traded through Switzerland. This history as a hub for Russian commodities makes Switzerland an important part in any assessment of the efficacy of sanctions against Russia.No date has been set for publication of the report.Additional reporting by Balz Rigendinger Edited by Virginie ManginVera Leysinger (Image research)","September 3, 2024 - 09:00"
168,Analysis-Japan’s general election outcome could muddle BOJ plans,"By Leika KiharaTOKYO (Reuters) – The risk of Japan ending up with a minority coalition government after the upcoming general election is raising concerns that the central bank could face complications in its quest to gradually wean the nation off decades of monetary stimulus.Several recent polls have shown the possibility of the ruling coalition losing its majority in parliament, which could cost premier Shigeru Ishiba his job or force his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to look for an additional coalition partner to stay in power.Such a prospect could deprive the BOJ of the political stability needed to steer a smooth lift-off from near-zero interest rates, some analysts say.It will also cause uncertainty in markets as attention is drawn to the policy stance of opposition parties that could become a potential coalition partner, many of which favour maintaining low interest rates.“Many opposition and ruling parties are calling for steps to boost wages, which could make it hard for the BOJ to hike rates until there is more clarity on next year’s wage developments,” said Naoya Hasegawa, chief bond strategist at Okasan Securities.“If the ruling coalition loses, markets will start to price in the chance of aggressive fiscal spending and a delay in further interest rate hikes,” he said.Expectations of a rate hike delay could push down short-term interest rates, potentially making it even harder for the BOJ to smoothly execute its plans for exiting accommodative policy, analysts say.When Ishiba dissolved parliament on Oct. 9 and called a snap election to be held on Oct. 27, many analysts expected the ruling coalition to comfortably win a majority and give the new premier a freer hand on policy.That would have allowed Ishiba to meet his pledge, made in a book he published in August, to roll back former premier Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics” radical stimulus measures that included the BOJ’s ultra-easy policy.“Extraordinary monetary policy cannot cure Japan’s ills,” Ishiba wrote in the book, blaming Abenomics and ultra-low rates for causing excessive yen falls, hurting commercial banks’ profits and eroding fiscal discipline.The BOJ ended negative interest rates in March and raised short-term rates to 0.25% in July on the view Japan was making progress towards durably achieving its 2% inflation target.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has signalled readiness to keep raising rates if the economy moves in line with its projections.A slim majority of economist polled by Reuters saw the BOJ forgoing a hike this year, with most expecting the central bank to raise rates again by March next year.NEW COALITION RISKRecent media polls, however, have dashed hopes among policymakers that Ishiba will solidify his standing in the ruling party after the election and support the central bank’s gradual exit from ultra-low interest rates.While earlier polls projected the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito would maintain their majority, a weekend poll by the Asahi newspaper showed they may struggle, with the LDP potentially losing 50 of the 247 seats it now has.Such a huge loss could make Ishiba vulnerable to attack from proponents of aggressive monetary easing like Sanae Takaichi, whom Ishiba narrowly beat in the party’s leadership race.If the LDP is forced to court opposition parties to stay in power, that will increase challenges for further rate hikes by heightening uncertainty over the new administration’s monetary policy stance.The biggest opposition, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, has called for modifying the BOJ’s inflation target from the current 2% to one “exceeding zero” – a move that will leave scope for rate hikes even when inflation slides below 2%.But the party’s leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has ruled out the chance of forming a coalition with the LDP.That leaves smaller opposition parties Japan Innovation Party and Democratic Party for the People, as potential coalition partners.The former wants to revise the law giving BOJ independence over monetary policy, and add maximum job creation and sustained economic growth to its mandate. The latter favours expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to achieve higher wage growth.“The hurdle for additional BOJ rate hikes will heighten if such proposals are taken into account in economic policy-making after the election,” said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.Even if the current coalition retains a majority and keeps Ishiba at the helm, the premier will face the challenge of pushing up his low approval ratings which partly took a hit with his flip-flop on topics including monetary policy.A day after becoming premier, Ishiba stunned markets by saying the economy was not ready for further rate hikes, an apparent about-face from his previous support for the BOJ unwinding decades of extreme monetary stimulus.If the LDP-Komeito coalition loses a majority, the newly created coalition will likely be forced to pledge big fiscal spending backed by ultra-loose monetary policy to appease voters ahead of next year’s upper house election, said Takuji Aida, chief economist at Credit Agricole Securities.“It will become nearly impossible for Ishiba to fulfil his goal of shifting to anti-Abenomics, tighter fiscal policy.”","October 22, 2024 - 05:54"

It described this success as “decisive for the high-speed transport sector”.Hyperloop technology relies on ultra-fast convoys running in a vacuum, with no friction and much lower air resistance than in the open air.The EPFL test facility consists of a “circular track” with a diameter of 40 centimetres and a circumference of 125.6 metres. This is a scaled-down version (1:12) of the hyperloop system described in the EPFL doctoral thesis of Denis Tudor, CEO of Swisspod.+Hyperloop projects inch closer to realityA hyperloop comprises two main elements: an all-electric vehicle and an infrastructure of low-pressure tubes, explains EPFL. To lower costs, the idea is that the vehicle rather than the infrastructure carries the energy needed to propel it.“Most of the effort is focused on developing a new linear induction motor (LIM), a key component of the hyperloop’s propulsion system, designed to offer better performance at high speeds”, EPFL saidFuture tests at the EPFL facility aim to further validate more efficient versions of the LIM-based hyperloop propulsion and levitation as well as explore the system’s real-world capabilities, limitations, and prospects, while offering vital data for accelerating the path to market deployment, EPFL said.Hyperloop freight tests are scheduled to take place in the United States in the coming years.“This is a key step towards making hyperloop a reality for people transportation and changing the way we connect, work and live,” said Denis Tudor cited in the press release.Translated from French with DeepL/sb","November 5, 2024 - 15:14"
170,What the EU crackdown on supply chains means for Swiss companies,"After years of debate, the European Parliament agreed this week to back two new laws that create obligations on companies to tackle human rights abuses in their supply chains. On April 23 the parliament gave the greenlight to rules

External link
requiring companies to not only identify human rights and environmental risks but to take measures to address them. If they fail to do so, they will be liable for damages in the EU.Both laws represent a shift away from regulators’ hands-off approach to corporate breaches of human rights in supply chains, says Nicolas Bueno, a professor of human rights law at UniDistance Suisse who has been following the EU process for years.“The fact that these two laws were adopted right now is a sign that European public opinion is increasingly ready to regulate the conduct of global corporate actors that have benefited for years from a legal void,” Bueno said. “They will now be accountable for harms they cause abroad.”Companies have long argued that self-regulation and voluntary actions are sufficient. However, human rights abuse in supply chains remain pervasive. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates
External link
that 17.3 million people in the private sector are forced to work against their will across a range of sectors such as agriculture, fishing and construction. An ILO report
External link
published in mid-March suggested that forced labour in the private economy generates around $236 billion (CHF216 billion) in illegal profits a year.Earlier this year, an investigation by Swiss public television, SRF, revealed that children are working on cocoa plantations in Ghana that supply Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt & Sprüngli. This is despite corporate pledges and programmes to eliminate it.Although Switzerland isn’t an EU member, Swiss companies that do business in the EU will be affected by the laws. The EU accounts for 58% of Switzerland’s trade volume

, making it the country’s largest trade partner.Under the EU forced labour law, national authorities in the 27-member bloc will investigate suspicious goods, supply chains and manufacturers. If products are made with forced labour, they will be banned from sale in the EU and intercepted at EU borders. This includes products sold via e-commerce sites such as Temu and Amazon.The US adopted a similar law in 2021 that was largely aimed at products coming from China made with forced labour in the Xinjiang region. EU parliamentarians said the EU law would include a list of high-risk areas and sectors.This law will have a notable impact on Swiss companies, says Gabi Sonderegger, a researcher at the Centre for Development and Environment at the University of Bern working on a research project

on forced-labour free supply chains. “Swiss companies will need to take proactive steps to ensure compliance to avoid facing these repercussions and maintain their access to the EU market,” she told SWI by email.The other law, called the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, applies to companies with 1,000 or more employees and a turnover of €450 million (CHF440 million) or more in the EU. This means that large companies both inside and outside the EU including from Switzerland will be subject to the law. Swiss companies may also be indirectly affected if they are in the value chain of large companies.  In 2020, Swiss voters rejected an initiative that would have placed similar obligations on companies. Instead, a watered-down counterproposal was adopted that required companies to identify and report risks of child labour and sourcing of minerals from conflict areas in their supply chains.The EU law goes much further than the Swiss law, according to Bueno. “Not only does the EU law cover a much more comprehensive list of human rights issues, it also sanctions companies, with potentially hefty fines, if they don’t take action to address the risks or human rights violations,” he said. “The Swiss law sanctions companies only if they don’t report risks.”Companies can also be held liable under the EU law, which means that anyone could bring a lawsuit against companies in domestic EU courts.Many global companies, including Swiss food and beverage maker Nestlé, have come out in favour of EU-wide laws in theory. In a statement
External link
on the company website, Nestlé said it supported “appropriate legislation” that aims at encouraging companies to address their potential impacts on human rights and the environment.It added that any rules should aim to level the playing field so that all companies are held to the same standards. This would avoid a piecemeal approach, where individual countries introduce their own rules.However, industry groups still have concerns. “The new provisions are very far-reaching and will entail high implementation costs for the companies concerned,” said Denise Laufer from the federation of multinational companies, SwissHoldings.The due diligence law was weakened to reflect such concerns. Earlier this year some major EU economies argued that the law would place an unreasonable burden on small enterprises, leading the EU to change the text so that it applies only to the largest companies.This drew criticism from some NGOs. “The last-minute political and business wrangling watered down the law and hampered the potential impact,” according to a statement by the NGO Anti-Slavery International.How much impact the laws have will depend on how they are implemented, said Sibylle Baumgartner, the director of Zurich-based consultancy focusright. “If child labour is found with a supplier, it’s not just about stopping a business relationship,” she told SWI swissinfo.ch. “Companies have to take steps to help the child return to school and take measures to prevent it from happening again.”Bueno says the biggest change that will come from the laws is “the new culture it will create inside companies. They will have to try to prevent human rights abuses from happening in the first place”.The next step is for the European Council to adopt the texts on May 23 and then translate them into national laws. Whether Switzerland will follow the EU lead remains to be seen. Swiss human rights campaigners argue that the EU decision puts more pressure on Switzerland, as it will soon be the only country in Europe that doesn’t hold companies accountable.“Switzerland must pass a corporate responsibility law as well,” wrote the Coalition for Corporate Justice in an emailed statement, adding that they are preparing a popular initiative on the topic for a nationwide vote.Last December the Swiss government said

171,India says Europe trade group commits to $100-billion 15-year deal,"By Manoj KumarNEW DELHI (Reuters) -India will lift most import tariffs on industrial products from four European countries in return for investment of $100 billion over 15 years, its trade minister said, after an economic pact signed on Sunday that concluded nearly 16 years of negotiations.The deal follows trade pacts over the last two years with Australia and the United Arab Emirates, while officials say a another, with Britain, is in its final stages, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims for annual exports of $1 trillion by 2030.It envisages that the European Free Trade Association, comprised of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, will invest $100 billion over 15 years in India’s fast-growing market of 1.4 billion people, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said.In turn, India will lift, or partially remove, very high customs duties on 95.3% of industrial imports from Switzerland, excluding gold, either immediately or over time, the Swiss government said in a statement.“Norwegian companies exporting to India today meet high import taxes of up to 40% on certain goods,” Industry Minister Jan Christian Vestre said in a separate statement.“With the new deal, we have secured nil import taxes on nearly every Norwegian good.”The pact covers some new elements such as intellectual rights and gender equity, Goyal added, telling a press conference, “It is a modern trade agreement, fair, equitable and win-win for all five countries.”The five signatories must ratify Sunday’s deal before it can take effect, with Switzerland planning to do so by 2025.The news comes ahead of general elections due by May at which Modi will seek a record third term.India has committed to cut its ‘bound tariff rate’ on gold to 39% from 40%, but does not anticipate much impact on imports of the metal from Switzerland, which were estimated at $16 billion last fiscal year, an Indian government official said.The Indian market offers immense opportunities for trade and investment, said Swiss economic official Guy Parmelin, adding that the pact was the result of 21 rounds of talks.India is the EFTA grouping’s fifth-largest trading partner after the European Union, the United States, Britain and China, with total two-way trade of $25 billion in 2023, its trade ministry estimates.“The agreement contains a comprehensive and legally binding chapter on trade and sustainable development,” the Swiss government said.“This will enable the EFTA states, in particular, to address trade-related sustainability considerations.”Analysts said the pact may not immediately help India to cut a large trade gap with the group, but will help draw investment into key industries.“The trade agreement will help attract investment in critical sectors like medical devices, clean energy and expand exports to other countries by accessing Swiss and Norway technologies,” said trade economist Ram Singh, who heads a New Delhi thinktank, the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.(Reporting by Manoj Kumar, Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber, Gwladys Fouche and Jayshree P Upadhyay; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and William Mallard)","March 10, 2024 - 12:02"
172,Tech Giants Roar as Nasdaq 100 Hits 22-Month High: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — The stock market extended its powerful November rally ahead of Nvidia Corp.’s results, with Wall Street also breathing a sigh of relief as a $16 billion sale of 20-year Treasuries lured bond buyers.Shortly after the auction results, US 10-year yields reversed course and fell to around 4.4%. The S&P 500 closed at the highest since August while the Nasdaq 100 hit a 22-month high. Both Nvidia and Microsoft Corp. climbed to fresh peaks amid a revival of the artificial-intelligence bid. In late trading, Zoom Video Communications Inc. rose on better-than-expected sales. The dollar dropped to an 11-week low.“We remain positive on equities and expect a broadening of the rallies recently experienced as the US economy continues on a sustainable economic expansion albeit at a modest pace,” said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management.Read: Nvidia Set to Post Another Sales Surge Amid AI Boom: PreviewTraders have also been fixated on Treasury sales, especially after the US recently offered an unusually large premium to sell 30-year securities. Those auctions have been exerting a growing sway over stocks, underscoring how the path of interest rates is gripping markets of late. The 20-year bond auction drew yields of 4.78%, compared with the pre-sale level of 4.79%.After a more than three-decade hiatus, the Treasury resurrected 20-year bonds in May 2020. Before Monday’s auction, it had not sold the securities during the Thanksgiving week. They’ve traded at a discount to other long-term maturities — which caused a degree of apprehension ahead of the sale.“Treasuries offer extremely attractive yields,” according to Principal Asset Management. “And while the potential for capital appreciation might be limited in the face of an impending economic slowdown, the assurance of a steady income from Treasuries makes them a solid option for investors prioritizing stability heading into an uncertain 2024.”To Peter Boockvar, author of the Boock Report, the auction was actually fairly mixed, with traders focusing more on the lower yield relative to the pricing right before it — rather than the below average bid to cover.Due to its somewhat “orphaned status” and small size, “I don’t know what to make of the auction in terms of messaging,” he noted.Read: Fed’s Barkin Says Inflation Job Not Done; Growth Easing to TrendAs the earnings season winds down, investors will be on the lookout for results from a handful of retailers and tech companies.Nvidia’s quarterly results Tuesday could exceed sky-high investor expectations thanks to strong demand for generative AI.

Strategists tracked by Bloomberg predicted on average in mid-October that the gauge would end the year at 4,370 — but it is already been trading above 4,500.To power back to its previous peak, the S&P 500 needs more than just the earnings recovery that appears to be underway — rate cuts are necessary, too. That’s according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s fair-value model of the US stock benchmark, which says the consensus 2024 price target on the gauge looks too lofty.The typical post-earnings recession rebound is expected to come against a backdrop of sustained higher interest rates. That’s likely to limit potential upside for the S&P 500 to around levels the gauge is currently trading at, even in the best-case scenario, based on projections by BI equity strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper.“The market as a whole has not yet eclipsed its early-2022 highs, reflecting the push and pull between optimism for a Fed-engineered soft landing and the potential underestimation of economic headwinds,” said Jason Pride and Michael Reynolds at Glenmede.Meantime, some of Wall Street’s top strategists are divided when it comes to Corporate America’s earnings outlook next year. While Citigroup Inc.’s Scott Chronert expects profits to hold up even if the economy slips into a recession, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Mislav Matejka says diminishing pricing power would crimp overall revenue and margins regardless of whether growth contracts.A Citigroup index shows downgrades to US earnings estimates have outnumbered upgrades for nine weeks in a row — the longest streak since February. Chronert does expect analysts’ estimates for 2024 to drop in the coming quarter — but that would only lower the bar for companies, he said.Read: Five Key Charts to Watch in Global Commodities This WeekAnd as the dollar rally stalled, it will take some firm real-sector data to challenge the current dovish Fed narrative, according to Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.“The US economy continues to grow above trend even as the rest of the world slips into recession, while price pressures remain persistent enough that the Fed will not be able to cut rates as soon and by as much as the market thinks,” Thin noted. “That said, the dollar remains vulnerable until we see a shift in market sentiment and expectations.”To Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management, the dollar should remain stable in the first months of 2024 due to robust economic growth and high interest rates relative to the rest of the world.Elsewhere, oil extended gains as traders boosted bets that the OPEC+ alliance will intervene in the market to bolster prices.Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Carter Johnson, Ye Xie, Matthew Burgess, Tassia Sipahutar, Robert Brand, Jeran Wittenstein, Elizabeth Stanton, Alexandra Semenova, Sagarika Jaisinghani, Edward Bolingbroke and Vassilis Karamanis.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","November 20, 2023 - 21:32"
173,Former emerging world finance chiefs call for debt reworks to enable climate spending,"By Libby GeorgeLONDON (Reuters) – A group of prominent former emerging market finance chiefs is pressing global leaders to incorporate external shocks and climate change into debt sustainability calculations, according to a letter published on Wednesday.The signatories, former central bankers and finance ministers mostly from emerging economies from India to Argentina, also called for debt relief to enable struggling emerging economies to meet climate investment targets.“Every civilization faces what seems to be an impossible hurdle that threatens its existence,” Patrick Njoroge, former governor of Kenya’s central bank, said in the letter.“We face such a moment, given the global debt crisis and the limited space for the required investments in climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals.”The World Bank has warned that high borrowing costs and slowing growth have sparked a “silent debt crisis” that has thrown climate, health and education spending goals into question across the developing world.The 21 signatories included Nigeria’s Lamido Sanusi, Colombia’s Jose Antonio Ocampo, Pakistan’s Reza Baqir, Argentina’s Martin Guzman and South Africa’s Tito Mboweni.Zambia this week became the first poor nation to emerge from debt default under a rubric designed by the G20 dubbed the Common Framework.But some have said the debt relief – estimated to have reduced Zambia’s debt by some $900 million and spread future payments over a much longer time frame – was insufficient.The letter is asking for the Common Framework to give countries fair, comparable debt relief from all creditors, with the relief sufficient to allow countries to meet climate and investment spending needs.The International Monetary Fund is also in the midst of a years-long revamp of the way it calculates debt sustainability analyses – figures that form the baseline to determining how much debt relief lenders must give to defaulted countries.These have been criticised in recent months and years by some investors and experts.The Debt Relief for Green and Inclusive Recovery Project (DRGR), which organized the letter, released a study earlier this year that found emerging countries will pay a record $400 billion to service external debt in 2024.It said 47 of them cannot spend the money they need for climate adaptation and sustainable development without risking default in the next five years.“It is time for G20 leaders to spearhead comprehensive debt relief and mobilize new financing to uphold sustainable development and climate objectives,” Wednesday’s letter read.","June 5, 2024 - 15:20"

175,How nature parks are becoming an oasis of Swiss-EU cooperation,"The group hikes upwards, following the trail carefully – leaving it is strictly forbidden in the Swiss National Park. None of these people need to be reminded of that. They are all park professionals. The delegation, comprising participants from Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, were invited to spend several days in Switzerland in September, and the excursion to the national park in the Alps in eastern Switzerland was a key item on the agenda.How can sustainable tourism and protecting biodiversity in nature reserves be promoted and, where necessary, combined? This question arises in a lot of places. The Swiss National Park can give some pointers. Founded in 1914, it is the oldest of its kind in the Alps and in Central Europe. It has remained an untouched reserve with maximum protection regulations for a century, and it is an important research site.The economics ministry invited the delegation because, after a long tug-of-war with the European Commission, Switzerland has concluded agreements with various Central and Eastern European states within the framework of its so-called cohesion contribution. Switzerland pays this contribution to the EU as a kind of compensation for access to the European single market. A little more than CHF1 billion ($1.1 billion) is earmarked for the Eastern states. As well as social security and economic growth, environmental protection is a strategic goal that Switzerland is pursuing with these payments (see box below).The conversations between participants at the national park intensify with each metre of altitude.“This exchange is very important – in the end we all face more or less the same questions, regardless of whether we are in the EU,” says Marqueta Konecna. She works at the Czech environment ministry, and is responsible for the design concept of parks in the country.She says Switzerland’s many years of experience in park management and monitoring are particularly important for the countries of the former Eastern Bloc. Switzerland is practically the only country in Europe that had no historic ruptures in the 20th century and was spared wars and regime changes.“This stability is unique and has resulted in experience that is very valuable for us,” says Konecna. “And, of course, Switzerland is very innovative. We can’t adopt everything, but it gives us ideas.”On this trip, she is particularly interested in the management of visitor flows in protected parks: how can mobility and sustainable tourism be combined, for example? “Of course, well-developed public transport is important. But so is coordination between all the parties involved: municipalities, tourism managers, park employees and so on,” Konecna says. She adds that there is much to be learned from Switzerland’s federal structure and the close cooperation between government agencies and private individuals, and the Swiss National Park is a good example of this.The park has an average of more than 100,000 visitors a year, and the region as a whole – which includes the world-famous ski resort of St. Moritz – receives around 1 million visitors, for a population of 9,300. The Czech parks do not draw such numbers, but as was the case elsewhere, they became more popular with the locals during the pandemic, Konecna says: “We have to consider questions such as whether to have more parking spaces or increased public transport.” The answer should be clear, but sustainability has to be affordable, she adds.While the Swiss National Park suffers from high visitor numbers, in Bulgaria it is the reverse. “People often see nature as an economic resource in our country,” says Angel Ispirov, the warden of the Central Balkan National Park in central Bulgaria. “The idea of protected natural areas does not appeal to everyone.”At 720 square kilometres, the nature park is only the second-largest in Bulgaria, but it is many times larger than the Swiss National Park, which covers 170 square kilometres.So the challenges are also different. Bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in the EU, and its priorities are of course different. “The park was officially created in 1991, but for the first few years it really only existed on paper, because staff were only hired six years later,” Ispirov says. Even today, the park has too few supervisors, which is particularly problematic when it comes to addressing the two biggest challenges: bears and poachers.“The bear population is increasing,” he says. “The animals are increasingly moving into populated areas. And poaching has always been a problem, an equally dangerous one.” Ispirov carries arms when he is on patrol.But he says the trip to Switzerland is also valuable for him. “It’s like a glimpse into the future: thanks to the experiences here, I can guess what might be in store for us.” He also learns from practical experiments – for example, how to use simple materials and techniques to treat sewage from huts in an environmentally friendly and self-sufficient way.“We have a well-developed network of huts in our park, but maintenance is difficult,” Ispirov says. “We are always looking for solutions to make them more autonomous.”According to the distribution key, the four delegation countries receive just under one-fifth of the financial resources allocated from the cohesion contribution: about CHF210 million. The projects relevant to the participants account for CHF83 million, plus the 15% contribution made by the states themselves. Daniel Birchmeier at the Swiss economics ministry has been involved in these projects for years.“Some of the countries receive significant cohesion payments from the EU,” he says. “It is therefore important for us to identify best practices that are useful for them.”The areas for funding range from tangible investments in high-quality assets (especially in energy, health and vocational training) to conceptual work and knowledge transfer. Birchmeier, who is in charge of the delegation, talks a lot about inspiration during the visit. He will give the group a tour through Switzerland lasting several more days to present more ideas. The Alpine air in the national park obviously made the participants keen to keep going.Although Bern and Brussels will probably need more time at the negotiating table to define their future relationship, this one aspect of Swiss-European cooperation has begun.Edited by Balz Rigendinger.

176,‘The world of conflict mediation is evolving’,"Thomas Greminger, current head of the Geneva Center for Security Policy (GCSP), is a Swiss diplomat and former head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).   Drawing from his decades-long experience in negotiations with millitant groups like Hamas, he discusses the challenges and opportunities in engaging with both state and non-state actors when it comes to peace talks. He argues Switzerland still has a role to play in international conflict resolution.     SWI swissinfo.ch: As a Swiss diplomat, you were directly involved in negotiations with Hamas members in the early 2000s. Could you share how this experience shaped your understanding of the conflict in the Middle East and potential resolution strategies?  Thomas Greminger: At that time, Hamas, including its more moderate faction, showed interest in international recognition and engagement. They seemed open to a long-term ceasefire, recognising Israel, and working towards a two-state solution, which included ceasing rocket fire on Israel in exchange for improved conditions for the Palestinian population such as less harassment at checkpoints. Our strategic goal was to reinforce these moderates.  In conflict resolution, identifying groups that seek international recognition and wish to break out of isolation is crucial. Switzerland’s strategy was to engage with these potentially constructive groups, to strengthen their influence over more radical elements. This approach was part of our broader dialogue with Islamic groups in the region.  SWI: In 2008, Switzerland drafted the Swiss document, a declaration of intent opening the way for talks between Israel and Hamas. How has Switzerland’s role evolved from being a privileged partner negotiating with Hamas, to supporting the classification of the group as a terrorist organisation?  T.G.: That’s an important question. Over time, the international community didn’t address the fundamental grievances of the Palestinians and shifted their perception of Hamas. It increasingly saw Hamas as a terrorist group and radical elements in the movement progressively gained the upper hand. The Swiss dialogue with Hamas never fully ceased but transitioned from a political to a more technical nature after 2008, when key international actors like the European Union decided not to join the process.  SWI: The Federal Council aims to officially label Hamas as a terrorist organisation. Is Switzerland still engaging with Hamas?  T.G.: Following the brutal attacks in October and the atrocities committed by Hamas, which were clearly of a terrorist nature, the Federal Council had to send a strong signal by labelling them as terrorists. However, in Swiss legislation, there are different ways to label a group, and some methods would probably still allow for discreet, behind-the-scenes dialogue, if deemed useful at some point.  +‘Declaring Hamas a terrorist organisation contradicts Switzerland’s neutrality’SWI: Could Switzerland play a role in moderating Israel’s military response, given the recent calls by the international community for such action?  T.G.: As an advocate of international humanitarian law, Switzerland’s role is to insist that Israel adheres to its principles, including the protection of civilians and in particular the principle of proportionality. This should be pursued through bilateral channels, multilateral platforms like the United Nations Security Council, and both quiet and public diplomacy.  SWI: South Africa has requested Israel be judged for genocide by the International Court of Justice. How do you assess Switzerland’s current role protecting International Law and International Humanitarian Law, especially as the depository state of the Geneva Conventions?    T.G.: Switzerland has indeed become more outspoken in sending clear messages to Israel about respecting international humanitarian law. While the ICJ’s legal action on the conflict is significant, it’s unlikely to fundamentally solve the Palestinian issue. A political process and commitment from the parties on the ground, including Israel and major stakeholders like the United States and Europe, are essential for a sustainable political solution.  SWI: Do you think the EU’s reluctance to engage with Hamas has impacted peace prospects in the region?  T.G.: Reflecting on this, is asking ourselves what might have been. Switzerland’s dialogue with Hamas almost 20 years ago was initiated with the hope that the EU would eventually come on board. An EU engagement could have potentially guided Hamas towards moderation, leading to more constructive outcomes. However, this is speculative, and we cannot be certain of the result.  SWI: Is there a noticeable gap between official government positions, particularly in the EU and the US, and public opinion on the ongoing conflict?  T.G.: Yes, there is a gap. On one hand, people are deeply affected by the devastation and the Palestinian civilian toll of the war, which is understandable. On the other hand, Western governments, influenced by the Israeli government’s perspective, focus on the need to decisively defeat Hamas. This contrasts with perceptions in the Arab world and much of the Global South. This dichotomy between the visceral reaction to the conflict’s human cost and the geopolitical and security-related reasoning behind government positions should not surprise us, though.  SWI: Some argue that international law and humanitarian law are the main casualties of the ongoing war. Do you think this undermines the perception of human rights as universal and a guarantee of security and dignity?  T.G.: Over the last few decades, there have been again and again serious violations of international law. These are not recent developments. However, there seems to be a relatively new trend of resolving conflicts militarily that is worrying. It further undermines a global order based on international law and commonly agreed rules. The shift from a unipolar world led by the US to a multipolar one where the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and Global South countries play a more important role has so far been creating a more chaotic and unstable system, disrupting the predictability of the rule-based order we once had.  SWI: With new actors like Qatar and Saudi Arabia emerging in conflict mediation, do you think Switzerland has lost some of its influence in good offices?  T.G.: The world of conflict mediation is evolving, and it’s positive to see new facilitators and mediators on the scene. Rather than fearing the loss of influence, Switzerland should look for complementarity with these new actors. There are different types of approaches that may succeed in facilitating between parties to a conflict. At times traditional mediation works, at times you may need a powerful or resourceful regional actor to facilitate. What always remains important is trust of the parties in the mediator. This makes investing in entry points for conflict resolution so relevant. This means building up relations of trust with the sides of a conflict which often represents a long-term process. SWI: What do you think of President Zelensky’s ten-point peace plan discussed during WEF in Davos?  T.G.: The Ukrainian government’s plan is a legitimate effort to mobilise international support for their concept of ending the war. This said, any formal peace process will need to include Russia. In this sense the actual outcome of a negotiated peace process will be different from what parties are calling for at the outset.  +Ukraine and Switzerland urge countries to support peace plan in DavosSWI: Based on your experience, are there clear differences in negotiation tactics when dealing with armed groups like Hamas compared to states in conflicts like Russia and Ukraine?  T.G.: Definitely, there are major differences. When negotiating with states, there are formal communication channels and established conflict resolution mechanisms. In contrast, engaging with non-state actors immediately raises issues about recognising their political status. However, in a highly polarised political environment formal communication channels and conflict resolution mechanisms among states tend to get quickly blocked. In addition, when non-state actors act as proxies for states, the differences between a process between formal state and non-state actors get blurred as well. Therefore, in both cases establishing a robust channel of dialogue often becomes the foremost challenge in the beginning of a process. Edited by Virginie Mangin/livm ","January 24, 2024 - 10:09"
177,Fed Pivot Will Dominate Year of Rate Cuts,"(Bloomberg) — The coming 12 months are shaping up as the year of the interest-rate cut.After racing ahead with the most aggressive tightening campaign in decades during 2022 and 2023, central banks around the world are poised to begin easing monetary policy as inflation continues to retreat.The shift is captured by Bloomberg Economics, whose aggregate gauge of rates across the world shows a decline of 128 basis points over the year, mostly led by emerging economies. Among such central banks, those in Brazil, the Czech Republic and others have already started that process.The US Federal Reserve will lead the pivot for richer countries after its policy makers signaled 75 basis points of cuts for the year, marking an abrupt shift from previous warnings that rates could still go higher through much of 2024. Read more: Do You Dot Plot? Understanding How the Fed Forecasts: QuickTakeOthers, such as the European Central Bank, are more reticent to signal cuts, but Bloomberg Economics expects the first easing there is likely to materialize in June. Markets are betting the Bank of England will cut that month too.Japan will remain the standout among its peers, with Governor Kazuo Ueda expected to tighten policy at last, by ending the world’s last negative rate.For emerging economies, Argentina and Russia are set to push through steep rate cuts. Mexico’s central bank, which had been resisting such action, is also expected to begin easing, according to Bloomberg Economics analysis.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Central banks are looking forward to a victory lap as inflation tracks back to target with only a modest blow to growth. Markets cheering the policy pivot will provide the appropriate soundtrack. The reality, though, is that monetary policy didn’t have much to do with post-pandemic price pressure on the way up, and can’t claim too much of the credit on the way down. One takeaway is that central bank tools are narrow, and the sources of inflation risk wide.”  —Tom Orlik, global chief economistPlans to bring down rates hinge on inflation continuing to slow. Skeptics warn that prices mostly remain some way from central-bank targets, and that policy will need to remain tight.Still, readings on both headline and core inflation continue to cool, led by goods prices with the services sector expected to follow, allowing officials to begin taking steps to ease the burden of borrowing costs on households and businesses.Here is Bloomberg’s quarterly guide to the outlook for the world’s top central banks, which set rate policy for a combined 90% of the global economy.GROUP OF SEVENUS Federal ReserveMost Fed officials expect to cut rates this year, starting to unwind the most aggressive tightening campaign in four decades in response to falling inflation. But they’ve also emphasized that their moves depend on making further progress on prices, and will be guided by incoming data.Policymakers forecast lowering rates by 75 basis points to 4.6% in 2024, according to the median projection released in December. Futures markets, however, are betting the Fed will cut rates six times this year, beginning with a likely quarter-point reduction in March.Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several of his colleagues have stressed that the central bank can “proceed carefully,” suggesting they’re not in a rush. Powell said at his December press conference that it was premature to declare victory, though he acknowledged that the question of when to begin “dialing back” policy restraint had been discussed.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Fed has reached the end of its hiking cycle. With core inflation looking to be on track to approach Fed’s 2% target — by some key metrics – in March 2024, the FOMC likely will be able to respond to faltering growth and rising unemployment with a first rate cut then. We expect another 100 bps of cuts in the rest of the year, bringing the upper end of fed funds rates at the end of 2024 to 4.25%.”—Anna WongEuropean Central BankIn contrast to the Fed, ECB officials are loathe to talk about the possibility of rate cuts. Despite inflation having receded much more forcefully than imagined, concerns remain about the pace of wage increases in the 20-nation euro zone. Clarity on whether such trends are cooling is unlikely before the second quarter of 2024.Governing Council members have refused to countenance any imminent cut — going up against market bets for a reduction within months as the region’s economy flirts with its first recession since the pandemic.The key now will be whether Europe experiences a mild downturn that would still count as a soft landing, or whether the lingering knock-on effects of the ECB’s unprecedented ramp-up in borrowing costs trigger a slump harsh enough to shift monetary-policy settings earlier than planned.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The ECB has finished hiking. Underlying inflation is falling, surveys are pointing to a significant deterioration in activity and credit extension is weaker than it was in the depth of the euro crisis. In addition, the mood music has changed globally. Unless the economy were to tank, the ECB will still need time to be satisfied that inflation is on the right trajectory. We expect the first cut in June 2024. However, the risks are heavily skewed toward earlier action.”—David PowellBank of JapanThe question for Bank of Japan watchers is when it will end the world’s last negative rate, not if. After succeeding in transforming the yield curve control program into a flexible insulator against sudden yield rises in his first year at the helm, Governor Kazuo Ueda will now parse incoming data to assess the stability of inflation trends.An earthquake on New Year’s day convinced the minority of economists predicting fast action on rates to push back their timelines to match the mainstream view, which sees the bank’s first rate hike since 2007 coming in April. The preliminary results of spring pay talks in March will garner the most market attention in years, as the BOJ has made it clear that’s one of the key factors in its pursuit of a virtuous wage-inflation cycle.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The BOJ has ramped up its communications efforts to set the scene for an eventual exit from YCC and negative rates. But it’s in no rush to make a move. What we still haven’t seen are clear signals from wages and inflation data that would convince the BOJ that its 2% target is secure. We see transition to a new framework occurring in the second half of 2024, most likely in July.”—Taro KimuraBank of EnglandTraders have also ramped up bets on a cut arriving as soon as May, despite BOE Governor Andrew Bailey insisting that it’s too soon to consider a policy pivot.There’s growing speculation that the BOE will be forced to abandon the higher-for-longer messaging kept at its December meeting, which notably contrasted with more dovish communications from the Fed.The BOE is likely to lower its inflation forecasts at the next meeting on Feb. 1 after November’s reading came in much lower than expected at under 4%.While the UK may have suffered a minor recession in the second half of 2023, its growth picture is beginning to brighten. The BOE’s new projections could reflect lower borrowing costs expected by markets, softer inflation prints, and growing wages in real terms. The central bank will also provide its annual assessment of the economy’s medium-term growth potential in February.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The outlook for CPI inflation has improved dramatically in recent months. We think it will fall below the BOE’s 2% target in the spring, providing ample space for the central bank to start easing. The first cut is likely to come in May, with rates ending 2024 at 4%.”—Dan Hanson Bank of CanadaWhile Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem has repeatedly said it’s too early to discuss cuts, economists and markets see the central bank starting to lower borrowing costs by the second quarter. In December, policymakers kept them unchanged for a third consecutive meeting, acknowledging a stalling economy while still keeping the door open to further hikes in case core inflation proves sticky.How Canada’s highly indebted households continue to fare amid the highest rates in two decades remains a key consideration. Their shorter duration home mortgages roll over more quickly than those of their American counterparts, a big reason why economists see the country’s economy as more rate-sensitive.Still, Macklem will likely be less inclined to declare victory than his peers. At the start of 2023 the central bank paused to assess the impact of its rate-hike cycle, prompting markets to immediately price cuts and contributing to a resurgence of inflationary housing activity. That’s not something they’ll want to risk repeating this time around.In a recent summary of deliberations of the December meeting, the six members of the bank’s governing council increasingly agreed that rates were “sufficiently restrictive” to bring inflation back to the 2% target, suggesting their conversation is moving from how high to how long borrowing costs should weigh on economic growth. Still, the bank says it needs to see clearer evidence of further and sustained easing in underlying price pressures before rate cuts will be considered.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Households and firms will continue feeling the pinch from higher prices and rates as the labor market cools along with broader economic activity. Though BOC Governor Macklem hinted that a policy pivot is on the horizon, we expect rate cuts to begin later in 1H’24 only after the data indicate the last mile on the road to 2% inflation can be achieved.”—Stuart PaulRate Cuts to Follow Further Economic SlowdownBRICS CENTRAL BANKSPeople’s Bank of ChinaChina’s economy is under pressure going into 2024 as domestic and overseas demand continues to falter. The central bank’s modest rate cuts have so far failed to alleviate deflationary threats, as consumer confidence wanes amid a record slump in the property market. While the country looks set to have achieved its roughly 5% growth goal, the next challenge is repeating it this year. That will likely take greater policy support due to a higher comparison base.The PBOC is expected to cut rates and banks’ required cash reserves moderately, in line with its cautious approach. Expectations for a move on the one-year policy rate in mid-January are increasing following commercial banks’ deposit rate cut last month. The central bank has stepped up financing for the property sector and promised emergency funds to local governments facing huge debt repayments.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The PBOC showed its easing stance with an 800-billion-yuan net cash injection via its one-year medium-term lending facility on Dec. 15, which was a record. Clearly, the economy needs more policy supports, as suggested by weak PMIs and soft inflation, and the central bank will continue to deliver. We expect the PBOC to resume cutting rates reducing banks’ required reserve ratio in 1Q24. The first rate cut can come as early as mid-January.”—David QuReserve Bank of IndiaReserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das wants to see inflation settle around the target 4% on a durable basis before he and other rate-setters consider a pivot.Projections, though, don’t suggest inflation staying at those levels for long in 2024. Volatile food prices pushed up the consumer price index for the first time in four months in November, and the December print could turn out even higher. Even as monetary policy has very little impact on food prices, elevated rates have managed to moderate a sticky and difficult core.The RBI’s focus has now shifted to ensuring food spikes are not transmitted to other segments of the economy. The benchmark repurchase rate has remained at 6.5% for five straight reviews through December and may stay there for a while longer while the RBI stamps demand further by making unsecured loans costlier. Growth, though, has surprised with a strong showing, forcing the central bank to raise its forecast by half a point to 7% for the fiscal year that will end in March.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBI will cut rates in coming months to counter an incremental slowdown in growth — but only after the Fed moves first. Our US team expects a Fed cut in March. We see the RBI cutting in April and taking the repo rate down 100 bps to a terminal 5.5% by 4Q24. Even so, it’s still likely to keep liquidity tight, possibility by selling government bonds starting in March, to maintain an ‘actively disinflationary’ policy.”—Abhishek GuptaCentral Bank of BrazilBrazil’s central bank has shaved two percentage points from borrowing costs since August in an easing cycle that most analysts see extending through mid-2024. Board members, led by president Roberto Campos Neto, have pledged to carry on with half-point rate cuts through March.Headline inflation has slowed to within the monetary authority’s tolerance range, and closely-watched core measures that exclude volatile items like energy and food are also easing. Still, central bankers are opting for a gradual cutting cycle as most analysts bet inflation will stick above the 3% target through 2026. Investor doubts surrounding President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s pledges to eliminate the primary fiscal deficit — which excludes interest payments — are complicating the policymaking outlook.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“We expect the BCB to keep the current pace through the May meeting. From then on the BCB will likely proceed more cautiously, with 25-bps moves, as the ex-ante real rate nears the highest estimates for the neutral rate (4.1% to 5.5%, according to a BCB survey). Our forecast of 9% by December assumes that the government will remain ambiguous on fiscal targets, and that the names of the new BCB appointees won’t be known until 3Q24.”—Adriana DupitaBank of RussiaAfter the Bank of Russia more than doubled the key rate in 2023 to 16%, Governor Elvira Nabiullina signaled in December that the end of the tightening cycle may be approaching. Still, she warned that “until we are confident that there is a steady downward trend in price growth and inflation expectations, the key rate will stay high for as long as necessary.”Policy makers are continuing to grapple with inflation that’s almost double the bank’s 4% target as President Vladimir Putin seeks a fifth term in March elections. Inflationary risks, including elevated budget spending on Russia’s war in Ukraine and a severe labor shortage, are poised to persist.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Bank of Russia’s key rate has peaked. Policymakers’ next job is avoiding premature easing. While most central banks face the same task in 2024, the Bank of Russia has fresh experience of what this mistake may cost. Its front-loaded easing in 2022 resulted in a ruble rout and drove price growth to triple its 4% inflation target in 2023. If it keeps the policy rate above 12% throughout 2024, inflation will come down to 4.7% year-on-year in December 2024.”—Alexander IsakovSouth African Reserve BankEven though price growth eased toward the end of 2023, inflationary risks remain at the fore of officials’ concerns, rendering them reluctant to begin cutting borrowing costs. The South African Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee is seen keeping the key rate unchanged at its two meetings in the first quarter.Governor Lesetja Kganyago says the central bank will continue to assess risks to the inflation outlook and stands ready to act should they materialize to ensure a return to the midpoint of its 3% to 6% target range, where it prefers to anchor expectations. One such danger could be increasing demands on public finances before elections this year that could weigh on the rand.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The SARB’s unanimous decision to keep the repo rate at its November meeting confirms the hiking cycle has ended. This implies the upside pressure on inflation in the near term will be transitory. We expect inflation to moderately pick up from 5.4% in November and peak in January, and thereafter slow towards the mid-point of the 3-6% target. The central bank is likely to start cutting rates in 4Q when inflation approaches the 4.5% level where the SARB wants it to be anchored.”—Yvonne MhangoMINT CENTRAL BANKSBanco de MexicoMexico’s central bank, known as Banxico, is the one holdout among Latin America’s major inflation-targeting banks, most of which have already started cutting borrowing costs. Banxico is expected to start an easing cycle early in 2024, with Governor Victoria Rodriguez saying a reduction could come in the first quarter.Even so, the bank’s board is predicting that inflation won’t fall back to the 3% target until the second quarter of 2025, meaning that any easing will be implemented gradually. Mexico’s June presidential election also stands to bring a new set of price pressures, with additional government spending on public works and the biggest fiscal deficit in over thirty years.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Banxico has held rates at 11.25% since the end of the tightening cycle in May, consistent with tight monetary conditions. Decelerating inflation and lower expectations provide room for some accommodation, but they are poised to remain above the target and limit the downside. Slower growth consistent with a narrowing positive output gap also supports a gradual adjustment. US rates are a risk. We see Banxico slowly cutting rates starting in March, but monetary conditions still tight in 2024.”—Felipe HernandezBank IndonesiaWhile Bank Indonesia embarked on its post-pandemic tightening cycle with swift and outsized moves, expect it to take more caution in its pivot to easing. Governor Perry Warjiyo has said the central bank will not match the pace set by the Fed, adding that it will have greater clarity to assess its own rate cuts in the second half of 2024.Chief among the risks are supply-chain disruptions, the El Nino dry spell, and election-related spending that could push up consumer prices. Lingering market volatility could also yet weaken the rupiah, bloating costs for imported goods like oil and rice, just as the lower 1.5%-3.5% inflation target kicks in this year.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Bank Indonesia is likely to cut rates by 125 basis points in 2024, but it won’t move until after the Fed starts easing. Jumping the gun would narrow the rate differential – undercutting the rupiah, which it has worked hard to prop up. Capital inflows are also vulnerable to a reversal if the global slowdown cools risk appetite. Another hurdle is inflation. Bank Indonesia is wary of a breach of its new inflation target. This likely keeps rates on hold in the first quarter of 2024.”—Tamara HendersonBank Indonesia Policy DashboardCentral Bank of TurkeyTurkey’s central bank is expected to wrap up its aggressive tightening campaign with one last hike in January.The overall expectation among analysts is for officials, led by Governor Hafize Gaye Erkan, to settle the benchmark rate at 45%. However, a sharp upward adjustment to the minimum wage could prompt a need for higher rates, according to Wall Street banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Local elections in March, seen as a verdict on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s rule, could still prompt the central bank to launch an easing cycle earlier than intended. That’s especially so given Erdogan’s preference for pro-growth policies through funneling cheap money as a means to boost electoral support.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Turkey’s central bank is not done hiking. This is even after it lifted borrowing costs by 3,400 basis points in 2023 following its sharp pivot since last May’s presidential and parliamentary elections. We expect the main rate to reach 45% in January from 42.5% currently and stay there through 3Q24 while the central bank delivers additional tightening via alternative tools such as changes to banking regulation.”—Selva Bahar BazikiCentral Bank of NigeriaHaving not met since July, Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Committee under its new governor, Olayemi Cardoso, is widely expected to deliver a large rate hike in the first three months of the year to show its willingness to act. Inflation that at 28.2% in November matched the record high from 2005 is forecast to continue to accelerate until at least the first quarter due to naira weakness and second-round effects from the removal of fuel subsidies that led to price hikes.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Central Bank of Nigeria plans on tightening policy in the first two quarters of 2024. We expect the shift to targeting inflation to lift rates by at least 500 basis points in the first half of 2024. The central bank will need to maintain a tight policy until 2025 for several reasons. First, a 500-bp hike would help bring down inflation from 28.2% in November and restore positive real rates by August. Second, outsized rate hikes are required to lower inflation expectations. Third, higher rates will attract the foreign financial inflows that will help converge exchange rates.”—Yvonne MhangoOTHER G-20 CENTRAL BANKSBank of KoreaThe Bank of Korea is pushing back against speculation it may follow the Fed in signaling an earlier-than-expected pivot. Governor Rhee Chang-yong has said each central bank now has more scope to set its own course based on domestic conditions, and that the “last mile” of the inflation combat could be tough.The central bank has held its rate at 3.5% for a year after having raised it by 300 basis points. Most board members still see the potential to raise the rate further if inflation remains tough to curb, but the number of those seeing no more need to hike increased from one to two in November, a sign the focus may be shifting to safeguarding economic momentum.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Bank of Korea will likely cut rates by 50 basis points in 2024 as inflation slows. We see the cuts starting in the third quarter and proceeding only gradually due to worry about excessive debt in the private sector. The BOK will probably also start a lending program designed to ease risks stemming from defaults in the real estate market — and reduce the need for more rate cuts.”—Hyosung KwonReserve Bank of AustraliaThe Reserve Bank of Australia is at the tail end of a tightening campaign that’s taken borrowing costs to a 12-year high, with just a few economists seeing the risk of another hike early this year if inflation proves yet again to be stubborn.Governor Michele Bullock, who’s stuck with a hawkish tone, isn’t expected to readily pivot to policy easing, unlike counterparts in other developed markets. Australia’s central bank meets next on Feb. 6 and by then will have had a chance to see a key inflation reading for the final three months of 2023.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBA has done more than enough to ensure inflation returns to its 2%-3% target band in a reasonable timeframe. The central bank enters 2024 in a data dependent hold. We expect the data will reveal a further slowdown in growth as rapid passthrough of rate hikes thus far hit consumer spending hard through 1H24. Swift policy passthrough means the RBA has less room to hold rates at their peak before policy needs to pivot to supporting growth.”—James McIntyreCentral Bank of ArgentinaPresident Javier Milei overhauled monetary policy at Argentina’s central bank after he took office on Dec. 10, devaluing the peso and changing the instrument it uses for its benchmark rate from 28-day bonds to 1-day repo notes, which implied cutting rates to 100% from 133%. The monetary authority, now led by Santiago Bausili, also embarked on a swift campaign to recoup foreign reserves.The coming months pose a massive challenge to monetary policy as Milei warns about the possibility of hyperinflation. Indeed, cost-of-living increases are already running hot because of the weaker exchange rate and the rise in regulated prices. The situation will likely get worse in the near-term, as some of Milei’s measures are seen propelling annual inflation to over 200% annually.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The sharply negative real rate set by the BCRA at the onset of Milei’s administration may help reduce the real value of the public debt. We see risks in that strategy — it may boost demand for public bonds, but also risk fueling inflation and a rush to the USD. We see the policy rate at 70% by end-2024 – our forecast assumes Milei delivers most of his fiscal-adjustment plan, and that currency controls remain at least partially in place through year-end.”—Adriana DupitaG-10 CURRENCIES AND EAST EUROPE ECONOMIESSwiss National BankWith Switzerland experiencing some of the slowest inflation among rich countries and more resilient growth than anticipated, the central bank can begin 2024 in its stride. President Thomas Jordan and his colleagues no longer have much of a tightening bias, but neither are they in any rush to cut rates. Instead, since the SNB sets policy only half as often as peers in the euro zone and the US, it has the luxury to wait and see how fast global easing materializes. By the time of its first decision of 2024 on March 21, both the Fed and ECB will have already met twice and guided investors more on how imminent rate reductions might be. As happened with tightening, Swiss policy roughly runs in tandem with the global cycle.The franc’s strength will help guide SNB priorities. With an eight-year high reached against the euro in December, officials announced that they’re no longer focused on selling foreign currencies. Jordan insisted though that the franc’s gains aren’t so large in real terms.Sveriges RiksbankWhile the Swedish central bank ended 2023 cheered by weakening inflation, Governor Erik Thedeen and colleagues are adamant that they can’t declare victory and cut borrowing costs. They signaled in December that the benchmark rate won’t fall below 4% until the third quarter of 2025.Economists and investors take a different view, reckoning that a feeble economy and easing price pressures could prompt a move as early as March. That prospect may be reinforced if the Swedish krona continues its current trajectory. The currency, which was a major headache for the Riksbank throughout most of 2023, staged a remarkable comeback after hitting an all-time-low against the euro in September. That strengthening may lessen the risk of higher imported costs fueling inflation again. Even so, board members are nervous about repeating past mistakes after previously underestimating faster consumer-price increases, and insist they’re ready to resume hiking if needed. What Bloomberg Economics Says:“At 4%, the Riksbank reached its terminal policy rate in September. Its war on inflation is over — we see price gains receding to the 2% target by mid-year and expect the Riksbank’s next move to be a cut in August. An earlier-than-expected kick off to easing cycles by other major central banks, or a repeat of last year’s downside inflation surprises may prompt a cut as soon as in June.”—Selva Bahar BazikiNorges BankNorway’s central bank is set to keep borrowing costs at 4.5% until autumn after it surprised most local analysts with a final quarter-point hike in December, citing the challenge that the weak krone poses to reining in inflation. Officials didn’t rule out another hike at a time when underlying prices growth remains high. While Norway’s economy has been cushioned by a windfall of fossil-fuel revenue from Europe since Russia’s war against Ukraine broke out in 2022, it faced an economic contraction at the start of 2023 and the central bank expects it to barely expand in 2024. Aside from how the exchange rate develops, the start of any easing cycle is also likely to be affected by the outcome of wage bargaining as worries about salary pressures linger amid the relative strength of the labor market.Reserve Bank of New ZealandThe RBNZ may begin cutting rates earlier than it had intended after the economy unexpectedly contracted in the third quarter and revisions showed much weaker growth in 2023, implying less inflation pressure.The data came two weeks after policymakers delivered a surprisingly hawkish rate outlook, signaling an increased risk of a hike and ruling out cuts until 2025.Investors are now betting that the first cut will occur in the second quarter of 2024, and are aggressively pricing further reductions through the remainder of the year.But Governor Adrian Orr and his policy committee remain concerned about emerging demand pressures from record net immigration and the ongoing difficulty they’ve had in getting core inflation under control.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBNZ’s hawkish stance is unrealistic, and won’t last long in 2024. The full effects of 525 basis points of tightening since October 2021 are being felt, with the economy contracting, unemployment rising and inflation cooling. BE expects the boost from strong migration will fade fast in early 2024, and a shift in economic reality will drive a policy pivot. Rate cuts are likely to arrive sooner than anticipated, in 1Q24, as the focus switches from fighting inflation to reviving demand.”—James McIntyreNational Bank of PolandPoland’s central bank will likely extend its pause in rate cuts after the newly-installed government widened the budget deficit to fund pre-election spending promises, including pay hikes for teachers.Policymakers led by Governor Adam Glapinski now worry that inflation will stay sticky after a rapid decline from as high as 18.4% in February. Such concerns are emerging after the central bank sought to spur the economy by cutting rates by one percentage point ahead of the Oct. 15 parliamentary election. That contest unexpectedly brought to power an alliance led by former European Council President Donald Tusk, who’s pledged to probe Glapinski’s conduct at the central bank. Tensions between the government and the governor are likely to shape policy discussions. What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The National Bank of Poland’s post-election policy pause will prove brief. The appointment of Tusk’s government will likely drive capital inflows higher and help the zloty extend gains. We expect the cutting cycle to resume in 1Q24 and take the reference rate to 4.75% by December 2024 from the current 5.75%. One major risk stems from the growing frictions between the government and Governor Glapinski, which could spook markets.”—Alexander IsakovCzech National BankThe Czech central bank lowered borrowing costs in December for the first time in more than three years, with policymakers anticipating consumer price growth to slow sharply toward the upper end of the 1%-3% tolerance range early this year.Governor Ales Michl warned the bank board will be cautious about future monetary easing and expects to cut rates less than implied in its latest projection, which sees the benchmark slashed by about half by the end of the year. “The process of lowering rates may be paused or halted any time at still-restrictive levels if inflation doesn’t decline as outlined in the forecast,” Michl said.–With assistance from Beril Akman, Clarissa Batino, Toru Fujioka, Tony Halpin, Erik Hertzberg, James Hirai, Harumi Ichikura, Claire Jiao, Scott Johnson (Economist), Sam Kim, Ros Krasny, Peter Laca, Andrew Langley, Yujing Liu, Matthew Malinowski, Steve Matthews, Tom Rees, Niclas Rolander, Anup Roy, Piotr Skolimowski, Ntando Thukwana, Ott Ummelas, Monique Vanek and Tracy Withers.(Updates with BE comment on RBA, RBNZ)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","January 18, 2024 - 06:05"
178,Ukraine seeks global help with massive task of landmine clearance at Swiss meeting,"By Emma FargeLAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) -Ukraine’s prime minister appealed at a meeting in Switzerland on Thursday for more help clearing landmines and unexploded bombs covering up to a quarter of the country – making it the most mined nation in the world.Switzerland, which is providing financial support, is hosting the conference this week attended by officials from around 50 countries to seek backing for demining Ukraine set to cost $34.6 billion, according to a World Bank study.Clearance is seen as a critical requisite for boosting agricultural production and for the return of millions of Ukrainians who have fled since Russia’s Feb. 2022 invasion. Already, 399 civilians have been killed by landmines and 915 injured, according to U.N. human rights monitors.“The scale of this challenge is truly massive,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, told the meeting in the city of Lausanne. “I call on the entire civilised world to increase support for Ukraine in the field of demining.”He said the country’s National Mine Strategy aimed to clear the country by 2033 but it needed help, especially with training 10,000 deminers and building machines which can clear terrain around 100 times faster than people.Already, the country has cleared 35,000 square kilometers since the war began, Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko told journalists. Some parts of Ukraine near the front lines are not yet eligible for humanitarian demining.To raise awareness of the risks, a Mine Action consultant in a keflar vest and visor walked senior government officials through a mock-up abandoned Russian trench, surrounded by anti-tank and personnel mines and a concealed grenade.The United Nations Development Programme’s Ukraine representative Jaco Cilliers told Reuters he had seen bombs hidden inside teddy bears and candy boxes.U.S. representative, Stanley Brown, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for political and military affairs, said it was considering new demining partnerships with Ukraine.Swiss President Viola Amherd told the meeting that the country will deliver three more remote-controlled machines from Swiss-based Global Clearance Solutions.The conference showcases this machine as well as new equipment such as AI-powered drones that can help with land surveys and detect even tiny, camouflaged “petal mines”.A follow-up meeting is planned in Japan in 2025. But some worry about dwindling interest in the problem, with the war in its third year. “My fear is the donors are not really prepared to sustain this effort for a long time,” said Hansjörg Eberle, director of FSD, a Swiss demining foundation active in Ukraine.(Reporting by Emma Farge, Editing by Angus MacSwan, Alexandra Hudson)","October 17, 2024 - 16:32"
179,"Brazil, France launch $1.1 billion program to protect Amazon rainforest","By Ueslei MarcelinoBELEM, Brazil (Reuters) -Brazil and France on Tuesday launched an investment program to protect the Brazilian and Guyanese Amazon rainforest involving 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in private and public funds over the next four years.The announcement was made during French President Emmanuel Macron’s three-day visit to the South American country, where he landed on Tuesday in Belem, near the mouth of the Amazon, and was met by Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.“Gathered in Belem, in the heart of the Amazon, we, Brazil and France, Amazonian countries, have decided to join forces to promote an international roadmap for protection of tropical forests,” they said in a joint statement.Their pledge to work together to stop deforestation in the Amazon by 2030 to contribute to slowing global warming comes two years before Brazil hosts the COP30 climate negotiations talks in Belen in 2025.“The presidents expressed their commitment to the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of the world’s tropical forests and agreed to work on an ambitious agenda, including … developing innovative financial instruments, market mechanisms and payments for environmental services,” the statement said.Macron and Lula took a river boat to visit a sustainable development project for producing chocolate on an island near Belem, and met with Indigenous leaders.At the event, Macron honored Indigenous leader and environmental campaigner Raoni Metuktire, of the Kayapo people, with the National Order of the Legion of Honor, France’s highest order of merit, for his fight to protect the rainforest and Indigenous rights.Chief Raoni, who became a global reference for campaigning in the 1980s with musician Sting at his side, handed Macron documents denouncing the environmental impact that a planned railway backed by soy farmers will have on Indigenous people, whom he said have not been freely consulted.Raoni asked Lula not to approve building the 1,000-km (620-mile) railroad known as Ferrograo that would lower agribusiness costs for shipping grains from Mato Grosso farm state to Amazon river ports and out to international markets.Despite past run-ins over the environment, relations between France and Brazil have recovered from a low point in 2019 when Macron led a wave of international pressure on then-President Jair Bolsonaro over fires raging in the Amazon. Bolsonaro accused Macron and other G7 countries of treating Brazil like “a colony”.“After a four-year eclipse and a virtual freeze in political relations between our two countries during Bolsonaro’s presidency, we are in the process of relaunching the bilateral relationship and the strategic partnership with Brazil,” a French presidential adviser said on Friday.(Reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Belem, Andre Romani and Steven Grattan in Sao Paulo; writing by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Stephen Coates and Sandra Maler)","March 27, 2024 - 09:04"
180,"Hungarian lawmakers, NGOs meet in dried-out riverbed to sound alarm over drought","By Krisztina Fenyo and Krisztina ThanNAGYKORU, Hungary (Reuters) – A group of Hungarian lawmakers and representatives of NGOs met on Wednesday on a dried-out sandbank of the country’s second river after the Danube to highlight the severe impact of a drought in July and August that damaged key crops.Water levels in the Tisza river dropped sharply after repeated heatwaves which also hit other European countries in what the EU’s climate change monitoring service says was the northern hemisphere’s hottest summer since records began.In Poland, the level of its longest river the Vistula, have fallen to a record low, the meteorological office said, leaving sandbanks exposed in Warsaw.Hungary’s Homokhatsag region, which is near where members of the country’s parliamentary committee on sustainable development and the NGO representatives met, is a key agricultural area, growing corn, grain and sunflowers that has been battling with severe droughts for years. “Policymakers still have not woken up to the fact that water is our most important treasure and today’s mistaken water management threatens our future,” the committee chair and an independent opposition MP Laszlo Lorant Keresztes said.He warned that Hungary “would dry out” unless measures are taken to preserve as much water as possible with efficient water management.Lawmakers of the ruling Fidesz party who have a large majority on the committee, boycotted the meeting – which lacked a quorum. The agriculture ministry did not send a representative either. The Fidesz parliamentary group said in a statement that they believed the meeting was “unnecessary”.Hungary’s Minister for Agriculture said on Sept. 5 that farmers had reported that drought damaged 390,000 hectares of sown land by early September, with maize severely affected on 235,000 hectares, which is more than 25% of all planted areas.Data from the Hungarian Meteorological Service shows that in the past 90 days, the Homokhatsag region had received around 120-140 millimetres less rain than average. Substantial rainfall was expected over the weekend.","September 12, 2024 - 08:53"
181,Better latte than never: Swiss coffee industry joins forces to improve conditions of coffee growers  ,"Little Switzerland is a coffee Goliath. The more than 40 members of the Swiss Coffee Trade Association (STCA) are responsible for more than half of all green coffee (non-roasted beans) bought and sold worldwide. Switzerland is also the top exporter by value of roasted coffee beans (worth over CHF3 billion or $3.4 billion in 2023) largely thanks to Nestlé that roasts all its coffee here.  But there are clouds on the horizon that challenge Switzerland’s role as a market leader. The Swiss coffee industry has to align with stricter sourcing regulations imposed by the EU as well as struggling small producers that are failing to make a living from coffee.  In a bid to ensure more sustainable supply chains, the Swiss Sustainable Coffee Platform (SSCP)
External link
was launched today. Supported by the Swiss government, it aims to bring the private sector, non-profits, academia and the government on the same page when it comes to the issue of sustainable coffee. The initiative comes as the industry is facing pressure from the European Union, which introduced a “zero deforestation” supply chain regulation
External link
. It’s planned to come into force in January 2025. Seven agricultural commodities, including coffee, cannot be sold in the EU unless it can be proven that they have not caused deforestation since 2020. The EU accounted for 44% of Swiss roasted coffee exports last year. Another problematic issue for the industry is guaranteeing farmers a living income from what is supposed to be a cash crop. Findings of a report published in 2023 by the Global Coffee Platform
External link
showed that small coffee growers in Brazil – the world’s top producer – are struggling to make ends meet. Those with plantations smaller than five hectares could not obtain a living income from coffee alone. According to Procafé, the Swiss association for the promotion of coffee, about 70% of the world’s coffee is grown by 25 million small farmers and the Swiss coffee industry is relying on them to stick to coffee cultivation to guarantee sufficient supplies of a high and consistent quality and avoid volatility in coffee prices. “While a company can refine its coffee sourcing policies, addressing systemic issues such as poverty in developing countries is far more intricate. Simply paying more for coffee doesn’t resolve these challenges, as poverty is a multifaceted problem with deep-rooted causes in economic inequality, lack of education, inadequate healthcare, political instability, and environmental degradation,” says Krisztina Szalai, Secretary General of the Swiss Coffee Trade Association and Chairwoman of the umbrella organisation Community of Interest (CI) Coffee Switzerland. Some of the big players like Nestlé have been working on environment and labour issues for a couple of decades in partnership with the certifying body Rainforest Alliance. The Swiss multinational has committed to responsibly source all its coffee by 2025 (it was at 92.8% in 2023).  However, there has been no industry-wide joint effort to tackle environmental, labour and living wage challenges in a way that reflects the strengths and needs of the Swiss coffee industry – until now. “Sustainability in coffee cannot be defined by a single metric or solely measured by certified volumes in supply chains. It encompasses a broad range of factors, including environmental stewardship, social equity, economic viability, and the well-being of coffee farmers and their communities,” says Szalai. The Swiss government is one of key partners in the sustainable coffee conversation thanks to the involvement of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Along with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, it is one of the main agencies within the government for overseas development.  Until the money from heavyweight private sector members like Nestlé or commodity firm Olam starts trickling in, the SSCP can count on SECO seed funding worth CHF8 million over four years of which CHF7million is meant for co-financing projects in coffee growing countries that a priority for SECO like Colombia, Peru, Indonesia and Vietnam.The goal is that the private sector eventually matches SECO’s funding even though members like Nestlé informed SWI that it is too early for them to comment on the future funding of the public-private-partnership projects. They will all have to pay up to CHF20,000 each in annual membership fees depending on size of the company and are expected to contribute more than 50% of the cost of projects in coffee-growing countries.  “Development cooperation alone cannot solve all the challenges related to sustainability in coffee. The Swiss Sustainable Coffee Platform offers an opportunity to collaborate and to leverage funding from the private sector,” Marco Kräuchi, Programme Manager, Trade Promotion at SECO. Government and private money channeled through the SSCP will fund projects that address challenges like livelihood and living incomes, climate change mitigation and adaptation, human rights, labour rights and due diligence. Kräuchi insists that the SSCP will not become a vehicle to outsource a company’s regulatory and corporate social responsibility obligations.  “It is not the SSCP’s role to support Swiss companies to be compliant with international regulations. It could be a side effect but is not the main goal of international cooperation.  The ultimate beneficiary are coffee growers in coffee growing countries,” he says. However, Kräuchi acknowledges that it will not be an easy task to get such a heterogenous group to agree on a common definition of sustainable coffee. “There is a certain risk that such a platform is perceived as if it might opt for the lowest common denominator.  The Platform members need to agree on what sustainable coffee means, for which the declaration of intent, that all members have to agree to, was a first step,” he says. The SSCP will be able to count on the experience of the Swiss Platform for Sustainable Cocoa (SWISSCO)
External link
that grew out of the chocolate industry in 2018 and serves as a template for the SSCP. Both initiatives aim to tackle global challenges such as poverty, climate and deforestation with a multi-stakeholder approach based on the principle of shared responsibility. Both coffee and cocoa are also dominated by millions of smallholders where Switzerland plays an important role in global trade and production. Since 2018, SWISSCO has supported 45 projects in cocoa-growing regions to the tune of CHF64 million. The share of Swiss imports of sustainable cocoa has gone up from 50% in 2017 to 82% in 2023.  “The experience of the Cocoa Platform has shown that it is worthwhile strengthening the exchange and cooperation between Swiss stakeholders. Today, the stakeholders are closer, trust each other more and are more open to transparent dialogue and concrete cooperation,” says SWISSCO executive director Christian Robin.  However, not everyone is of the opinion that the Swiss coffee industry should follow in the footsteps of the chocolate industry when it comes to sustainability measures. Swiss NGO Public Eye warns that the Coffee Platform risks becoming another “legally non-binding talking shop” in the absence of strict enforceable laws of the kind the European Union has passed.  “It would be even better if Switzerland were to finally introduce effective regulations that make due diligence obligations legally binding and provide for effective sanctions. Instead, our government is sticking to non-binding dialogue without accountability and with a highly uncertain outcome,” states Carla Hoinkes of Public Eye in a press release

on the day of the launch. In February, the governing Federal Council decided against adapting Swiss law to follow the EU’s lead “until further notice” citing increased administrative burden on companies that do not export products to the 27-member bloc. Instead, the government intends to reconvene in summer to assess the impact of the EU’s Regulation on Deforestation Free Products on Swiss companies.  The SSCP will have to therefore rely on its NGO and academia members (who also occupy half the seats on the board) to challenge any attempts at “greenwashing”.

182,Selfridges Stands Out as a Winner in Signa’s Retail Implosion,"(Bloomberg) — On London’s busiest shopping street, Selfridges’ holiday window displays feature Christmas traditions and a large neon sign flashing “Showtime!,” while visitors inside clutch the store’s eye-catching yellow tote bags amid stacks of goods from the likes of Hermes and Fendi. With disco balls scattering glints of light and carols rising above the hum of activity, the crowds are thick even before the shopping landmark rolls out its full array of in-store entertainment, featuring dancers, confetti cannons and of course Santa Claus. But this kind of flair and spectacle stands out in the teetering retail and property empire pieced together by self-made mogul Rene Benko. In addition to a stake in Selfridges, the 46-year-old’s Signa owns Germany’s largest department-store chain as well as stakes in retailers in Italy and the Netherlands. As the debt-laden conglomerate fights to ward off collapse, joint venture partners like Thailand’s Central Group, creditors and rival investors are set to jostle for control over key assets. Destination-style outlets like Selfridges, Berlin’s KaDeWe and Switzerland’s Globus are well-positioned, but most locations are outdated and are likely to end up as castoffs.“You would think there would be no end of potential Middle East or Asian investors who would be very keen to invest in Selfridges,” said John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt in London. “It’s very much still regarded as a trophy asset.”The same can’t be said for many of Signa’s other department stores, which will likely require total redevelopment to have any kind of sustainable future, according to Lea Scholze, an architect at AIP — a Dusseldorf-based developer that transformed a shop from Benko’s Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof chain into a mixed-use facility in the former German coal mining town of Recklinghausen.With high interest rates weighing on property markets, it’s a difficult time for commercial real estate, especially in the retail sector after the Covid-19 pandemic made online shopping commonplace. With 37 of the 129 remaining Galeria stores set to close by next year, Germany will be a focal point of the upheaval.“A giant store with only one function won’t work long-term anymore, especially in smaller towns,” said Scholze.Signa’s complex structure complicates the process of picking through assets to extract winners. While Benko wooed local officials with promises to revive struggling town centers, he was mostly interested in select locations and developing projects around them. He separated retail operations from the underlying property, creating a multi-layered structure with different investors and financing structures at various levels. Benko’s strategy fared well in Switzerland. Signa and Central Group acquired the Globus chain in 2020 for around 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) and moved swiftly to sell off more than 30 outlets in smaller towns to focus on a handful of large stores in cities such as Zurich, Geneva and Basel, where they could still draw a crowd.However, Germany has been a real problem. Since Signa merged Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt in 2020, the retailer has initiated two insolvency proceedings. Despite several state-subsidized rescue attempts, thousands of people are now losing their jobs and local municipalities face the challenge of how to put unwanted properties to use.Retailers in smaller markets are still struggling to get foot traffic back to pre-pandemic levels while vacancies are rising, said Jan Schönherr, German head of retail investment at real estate brokerage CBRE. “There has always been a gap, and it has widened further,” he said.Hanau, a city of 100,000 people near Frankfurt, is one of the communities hit, and the local Galeria outlet is shuffling through its final holiday season. Shop windows that used to be adorned with toy trains are plastered with posters informing customers that the store will be gone in less than three months. The clearance sale — announced by a 15-foot pink-and-yellow banner — means even clothing racks and display cases can be bought for a discount.It’s a heartbreaking sight for locals. During its golden days, Hanau’s prime shopping destination accounted for 10% of all sales in the city center. But things could get worse when the store finally closes for good.“The day after Galeria hands over the keys, this building would fall into disrepair,” said Mayor Claus Kaminsky. His administration bought the store to prevent a yawning gap and will initially use it as a community center. “As a city, we are taking matters into our own hands to steer our downtown in the right direction,” he said.At its peak, Signa’s €23 billion ($25 billion) property empire stretched from luxury hotels in Venice to high-end malls in Vienna and the Chrysler building in New York. As valuations came under pressure and financing issues mounted in recent months, Benko was pushed by other investors to step back. Restructuring experts Ralf Schmitz and Arndt Geiwitz were brought in to spearhead an overhaul. Forced asset sales could be part of a survival plan.

Central Group has already secured control of Selfridges’ operating company by converting a loan into equity earlier this month. The Thai retail conglomerate, which is owned by the Chirathivat family, has said it intends to support all of its European luxury businesses — which also includes Berlin’s KaDeWe — and ensure they receive the necessary support to continue operations.“Selfridges is a winner in the sense that it has stood the test of time” and has continued to evolve, said Joe Dawson, a retail analyst at consulting firm GlobalData Plc. At the 500,000-square-foot store in London, the seasonal retail theater has only just started. The festivities will ramp up to include live DJs and choirs. Its Christmas Shop offers sparkly home decorations including golden poodle tree ornaments and personalized Santa stockings. The festive mood is still bringing in the shoppers.“We love the atmosphere,” said Marie Smith, who was visiting Selfridges with her daughter as part of their annual ritual to see the Christmas lights on Oxford Street. “Selfridges is amazing. It’s never standing still.”–With assistance from Paula Doenecke and Marton Eder.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2023 - 05:00"
183,Geneva Airport CEO sees clouds on horizon,"Following the lean years of the pandemic, Geneva Airport has bounced back to healthy traffic levels and turnover. The SWISS and easyJet airlines hub made a profit of CHF46.3 million in 2022, thanks to the resumption of air traffic and its network of connections.  However, the independent public body went through a strike during the summer, following disagreements on changes in pay policy due to slow expectations of growth. SWI swissinfo.ch spoke to André Schneider, who has been CEO of Geneva Airport since 2016. SWI swissinfo.ch: Mr Schneider, where do you go on holidays? André Schneider: In the past, when I was working for WEF (World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland), I had to be a frequent traveller! But what I like most now is places where I can tour on my motorbike – say in the Alps, or the Black Forest, or on the Atlantic coast of Norway.  SWI: You were a senior executive in two public-sector organisations before (WEF, and the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne). What is different about Geneva Airport?  A.S.: The three organisations are very different, but I love a challenge and trying out something new. They do have one common point: all three of them have a high political profile. One unique feature of the airport is how heavily regulated it is.  Fortunately for me, I enjoy navigating a complex environment and, while dealing with the various interest groups, setting out in new directions and achieving real results for the public good. At the airport, I enjoy the long-term planning – up to 2050 – and the analysis of changes in society which that involves. SWI: In future, you forecast an annual growth for the airport of no more than 1%. Does that mean people are giving up air travel to save the planet? A.S.: Nearly 90% of our passengers are going to destinations in Europe. With over 130 destinations, our continental network is very dense. As we are approaching saturation, we can hardly offer any more continental travel. That explains our low growth forecast, far below the 5% figure we used to have.  Our strategy is to add a few intercontinental routes but they won’t contribute much to our volume of passenger traffic. To be sure, in view of  the climate change crisis, people are wondering if they should cut back on travel, but for the present anyway this does not seem to be affecting our figures.  SWI: To make up for slow growth, could you better your operational efficiency and add to your non-air-transport activities?   A.S.: We are certainly aiming at more efficiency and profitability, but we can only do so much in view of our regulatory environment. Airport fees, which represent 50% of our revenue, have to correspond to services and so they incur costs.  In other words, we can only make a profit on the commercial services we offer, like restaurants, shops and parking. In general, and also due to the climate change crisis, we will just have to get used to little or no growth. SWI: Who are your main competitors?  A.S.: When it comes to passengers, other airports do no really count as competition. Lyon airport is near enough, but it doesn’t offer the same services that we do. On the other hand, people in Fribourg and Bern sometimes have to choose between our airport and Zurich.  As regards the railways, we are competing a bit, all right, but it’s just for getting to Paris and Zurich. On the other hand, if we are going to win intercontinental routes from the airlines, we will be competing with the other airports in Europe, including Zurich. SWI: What are the best airports in the world, do you think? A.S.: Every airport is a different animal, and we are always trying to learn from the others. To give an example, I admire the way Montreal manages to handle snow conditions. Zurich airport is a model of efficiency. And Nice is worth looking at with regards to travel. Finally, Geneva deserves recognition for its sustainable development. SWI: What is your most lucrative customer segment, and what do you do to attract them?  A.S.: The kind of passenger we make the most profit from is the “premium” traveller, that is, people who travel in first class, business class or premium economy. These are the people who travel for business as well as tourism or visiting family and friends.  Of course, the premium segment tend to spend more money in our airport restaurants and shops, as well as using paid services. To attract this group, the best we can do is to offer a good range of destinations, plus services like parking reservations or priority lanes for security checks. SWI: In many airports abroad, they offer a whole range of “super VIP” services, like fast-tracking through customs. Is your airport doing anything like this?  A.S.: In the Schengen area, for legal reasons, we can’t offer fast-track customs inspection to some of the passengers. However, apart from the services you mentioned, we try to make the process of travelling through our airport as pleasant as possible for everyone.  For example, we measure the time it takes to get through security, customs and baggage return. We also have a special diplomatic service aimed at the 5000-odd heads of state and government ministers who come here each year on business in international Geneva.SWI: Nearly half (45%) of your traffic is by EasyJet. If they decided to leave Geneva, would they be soon replaced by other airlines? A.S.: In most airports, the main airline gives you 60% to 70% of the flights. So  our situation is actually a bit more balanced than that. If easyJet decided to go somewhere else, which I think unlikely, the gap would be filled soon enough, when you think of the demand there is from our catchment area. Obviously, the adjustment would take a while. SWI: As you mentioned, you are going to offer more intercontinental routes, like Zurich Airport does. Have you really got room for these in your existing schedule? A.S.: Zurich Airport is a hub, and for that reason it will always have more intercontinental flights than we do. We are rather a “point-to-point” airport, so we depend completely on our local population. Our aim is to keep working in the long term to get more intercontinental routes and increase on our present range of 12 such destinations.  Yes, we do have room for these flights in our timetable, though we are completely full during some “rush-hour” periods, especially during the winter skiing season. Moreover, Geneva airport has one unusual characteristic: most tickets sold are first and business class, which means greater profitability for the airlines.  SWI: Your airport is an independent public body, whereas Zurich Airport is a publicly-traded company. Do you sometimes envy the flexibility that gives? A.S.: An airport needs to take a whole range of interests into account, and the complexity of our structure makes us consider all these interests whenever a new idea is to be implemented. On the other hand, Zurich’s corporate structure means it can give priority to shareholder value. But in the end, Zurich is an airport that also has to work with its surrounding community, with the local population areas and the political level as well.   SWI: This spring, your airport had to deal with a strike over pay rates. How do you explain the fact that labour peace, which is otherwise invariably the case in Switzerland, didn’t work here?    A.S.: We are in the middle of negotiations right now, so I would prefer not to say anything at this stage. In view of our low growth in profitability, every level needs to adapt. I trust we will arrive at a satisfactory solution soon.  Edited by Samuel Jaberg/ds Translated from French by Terence MacNamee ","October 18, 2023 - 10:24"
184,"Israeli strikes kill at least 40 Palestinians in Gaza, as ceasefire talks begin","By Nidal al-MughrabiCAIRO (Reuters) -Israeli airstrikes killed dozens of Palestinians on Monday as Hamas leaders visited Cairo for a new round of truce talks, with more than half the dead in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which foreign leaders have urged Israel not to invade.Hours after the strikes on Rafah, where almost half of Gaza’s 2.3 million population have sought refuge from months of Israeli bombardment, Egypt’s state-affiliated television said the Hamas delegation left Cairo for Doha and would return at an unspecified later date with a written response to the ceasefire proposal.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Hamas to swiftly accept what he called an “extraordinarily generous” Israeli proposal for a truce in the Gaza war and the release of Israeli hostages held by the Palestinian militant group.U.S. President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi spoke by phone to discuss developments in negotiations regarding a ceasefire in Gaza and dangers of military escalation.Bombs hit three houses in Rafah on Monday. And in Gaza City, in the north of the strip, Israeli warplanes struck two houses, killing at least six people and wounding several others, health officials said.With nightfall, an Israeli air strike on a house in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed three Palestinians, including a journalist, medics and Hamas media said. Six other people were killed in other central Gaza areas in separate Israeli air strikes, they added.Israel’s military on Monday said two soldiers were killed in central Gaza on Sunday.The armed wing of the Hamas-allied Islamic Jihad said it fired rockets into Israel on Monday, signaling the group was still able to launch rocket attacks after nearly seven months of the Israeli air and ground offensive.Asked about the Rafah strikes, an Israeli military (IDF) spokesperson said fighter jets had “struck terror targets where terrorists were operating within a civilian area in southern Gaza,” declining to give details.At a Rafah hospital, relatives of those killed in the strikes came to take the bodies away for burial. Women and men cried as they paid farewell to slain relatives wrapped in white and black shrouds.‘THEY’RE ALL GONE’“His name is Deif-Allah (meaning guest in Arabic) and he was indeed a guest. He came as a guest after (his parents) longed for (him) for so long, after 10 years,” said Abu Taha, holding the body of his baby boy.“Ten people (were killed), the mother, her daughter, her granddaughters, her grandson, her son-in-law, their daughters and relatives, everyone. They’re all gone, all 10 of them.”Speaking on Monday at a World Economic Forum meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Egypt was hopeful about a proposal for a truce and the release of hostages, but awaiting responses from Israel and Hamas.“We are hopeful the proposal has taken into account the positions of both sides, has tried to extract moderation from both sides, and we are waiting to have a final decision,” Shoukry said.A Palestinian official close to mediation efforts told Reuters: “Things look better this time,” but declined to say whether an agreement was imminent.Israel’s military operation to eradicate Hamas has killed 34,488 Palestinians and wounded 77,643, according to Gaza’s health authorities. It has displaced most of the Palestinian enclave’s 2.3 million people and laid much of the area to waste.The campaign was triggered by the Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.‘PERIOD OF SUSTAINED CALM’An assault on Rafah, which Israel says is the last Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip, has been anticipated for weeks. Foreign governments and the United Nations have expressed concern that such action could result in a humanitarian disaster given the number of displaced people crammed into the area.Two Hamas officials who spoke to Reuters did not disclose details of the latest proposals, but a source briefed on the talks told Reuters Hamas was expected to respond to Israel’s latest truce proposal delivered on Saturday.The source said this included an agreement to accept the release of fewer than 40 hostages in exchange for releasing Palestinians from Israeli jails, and to a second phase of a truce that includes a “period of sustained calm” – Israel’s compromise response to a Hamas demand for an end to the war.After the first phase, Israel would allow free movement between south and north Gaza and a partial withdrawal of its troops, the source said.In Tel Aviv, the families of two Israeli hostages who appeared in a video issued by Hamas over the weekend held a press conference, calling for an immediate deal that would secure the release of some 130 hostages still held.“I want to ask everyone to stop the talking and start the actions. We are losing people that are alive now and there is no time to waste,” said Elan Siegel, daughter of Keith Siegel, a 64-year-old dual U.S. citizen taken captive with his wife Aviva, who was released during a brief November truce.A senior Hamas official told Reuters the Monday talks in Cairo would take place between the Hamas delegation and Qatari and Egyptian mediators.“Hamas has some questions and inquiries over the Israeli response to its proposal, which the movement received from mediators on Friday,” the official told Reuters.Those comments suggested Hamas might not hand an instant response to mediators over Israel’s latest proposal.(Reporting Nidal Al Mughrabi, Additional reporting by Andrew Mills, Henriette Chacar, Aidan Lewis and Maher Hatem; Writing by Nidal Al Mughrabi and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Lincoln Feast, Angus MacSwan, Mark Heinrich, Sharon Singleton and David Gregorio)","April 29, 2024 - 23:19"
185,UK finance minister Reeves promises economic ‘reset’ in upcoming budget,"By David MillikenWASHINGTON (Reuters) – British finance minister Rachel Reeves said she would be presenting her upcoming budget as a chance to reset the country’s economy and boost investment when she meets international partners in Washington on Thursday.Reeves is on a two-day trip to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings, less than a week before she presents the Labour Party’s first budget after 14 years out of power.Government sources said last week she would be aiming to raise around 40 billion pounds ($52 billion) through a mix of tax rises and limited savings in public spending to boost public services and fill a budget hole left by the previous administration.Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday that Reeves would also use the IMF meetings to tee up a change to the fiscal rules which constrain government borrowing. Asked about the report, a Treasury spokesperson said the ministry did not comment on budget speculation.“I’ll be in Washington to tell the world that our upcoming Budget will be a reset for our economy as we invest in the foundations of future growth,” Reeves said in a statement released to mark the start of her trip.“It’s from this solid base that we will be able to best represent British interests and show leadership on the major issues like the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.”Earlier this week Britain said it would lend Ukraine $3 billion to buy weapons as part of a wider loan by the Group of Seven rich nations, backed by frozen Russian central bank assets.Britain’s finance ministry said Reeves would support proposals in Washington to expand development financing for poorer countries to meet the United Nations’ sustainable development goals and encourage generally richer G20 countries to be more transparent about their own debt.On Tuesday the IMF upgraded its 2024 growth forecast for Britain more than for any other G7 country, although at 1.1% for 2024 and 1.5% for 2025 its forecasts remain modest by historic standards.The global lender also said Britain, like most other G7 countries, needed to stem a rise in public debt.Reeves has been eyeing changes to Britain’s domestic budget rules to make it easier to finance public investment, potentially by using a looser definition of public debt that allows a wider range of public assets to be offset against borrowing.The Guardian said Reeves planned to target a measure known as public sector net financial liabilities – which allows illiquid financial assets to count against debt – rather than the existing target of public sector net debt, excluding the Bank of England.Britain’s Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank previously estimated that such a change would potentially allow an extra 50 billion pounds of borrowing.($1 = 0.7746 pounds)","October 24, 2024 - 01:02"
186,UN General Assembly president: ‘Over 75 years we’ve not had a Third World War’,"“There’s evidence that [the Security Council] has been unable to take decisions in the context of peace and security. But the General Assembly has not hesitated to act decisively,” responds Dennis Francis, when asked about the United Nations Security Council’s inability to act in response to the ongoing wars in Gaza and in Ukraine.The 67-year-old diplomat from Trinidad and Tobago is the current president of the New York-based General Assembly – the only UN organ in which every member state has a seat, a vote, and importantly, where no country has a veto.In this role, Francis heads the meetings of the 193-member body. It offers him a unique perspective on the priorities and concerns of the international community. As a representative of all UN member states, he is one of the organisation’s top officials.Francis is dressed in the typical diplomat’s uniform – a navy blue suit and a tie. We met him shortly after his address to the Human Rights Council in Geneva earlier this week, during which he once more called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza and for the opening of corridors allowing more aid to enter the strip where some 1.7 million people are displaced.The Security Council is responsible for maintaining peace and security in the world, but as Francis points out, the General Assembly retains “residual responsibility” for it, meaning that it has to take on failures of the Security Council.Over the last two years, the Security Council has been paralysed by the constant veto of some of its five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States). It could not stop Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or vote a ceasefire in Gaza which is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.As a result, the General Assembly has stepped up to tackle issues on which the Security Council could not agree. Not long after the beginning of Russia’s war on Ukraine in February 2022, the UN body condemned Moscow’s violation of the UN Charter. And on Gaza, the General Assembly has called for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. But unlike those of the Security Council, its resolutions are not legally binding and only carry moral weight.“What the General Assembly has done is to try to bring a halt to the hostilities, to take people out of harm’s way, and to create a climate in which some sort of political process can be initiated that could possibly lead to the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli question,” explains Francis. But the diplomat does not say what further action the General Assembly could take.Francis worries about Israel’s plan to conduct a ground offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah where most Gazans have relocated. “Our big concern is that, should a way not be found to move those people out of harm’s way, there would be a real tragedy of human lives being lost again,” he says.Last week, the head of the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the Swiss Philippe Lazzarini, sent a letter to Francis saying that his organisation had reached a “breaking point” threatening its ability to fulfil its General Assembly mandate, which includes providing Palestine refugees with services like education, primary health care, or emergency assistance. He warned that UNRWA’s operations would be “severely compromised” from March due to a lack of funding.Israel has accused UNRWA staff members of having taken part in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 prompting some of the organisation’s donors to suspend their funding. Two investigations are ongoing to verify Israel’s claims.“UNRWA has been a lifeline to the people of Palestine from its inception,” says Francis, who hopes donor countries will maintain their support for UNRWA until the investigations are closed.“The evidence has yet to come forward. But in the meantime, the life and the welfare of the people caught in Gaza hang in the balance,” says the diplomat. “I called upon donor countries to maintain their support for UNRWA. Because if we don’t then I fear that we may find ourselves having to accept some level of responsibility for what happens to the people of Gaza.”As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, UN aid agencies continue to support its victims. But on the political front, the organisation has yet to take meaningful action.Could the General Assembly propose a UN mediation of the conflict? “A UN-mediated peace process I suppose is possible in principle. But it would only be practicable if the UN enjoys the support of both sides. It’s not clear to me at this stage that this is the case,” replies Francis.He adds that he is ready to support “any initiative that could lead the way to bringing this unjust war to a halt” but says he fears this war could “drag on for a very long time”.Last year, some of the UN’s biggest contributors, including the US, failed to fully pay their membership fees in time, leading the UN office in Geneva to close for three weeks to save money.Is Francis worried about countries possibly leveraging their contributions to weaken the UN? “I don’t know the specific reasons why member states may be delaying their contributions,” he says. Francis adds that the UN’s work is “definitely impacted” by the lack of resources and encourages countries to pay their bill as soon as possible.Conflicts, violations of international law, climate change, a world way off target on its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – how does the president of the General Assembly remain optimistic about the future? “Because when I sit on the podium, and I look out, and I listen to the statements, I hear where people are mentally. And often I hear positive messages, a determination from members that we have to move forward,” he says.“We have a mandate to act in a manner that furthers the interests of the international community as a whole,” says Francis. “The political will might not be as strong now as we need it to be, but we have the capacity, we have the experience, and we have more than anything else, almost 75 years of success in doing it. Because, let’s face it, over 75 years we’ve not had a Third World War.”Edited by Virginie Mangin/livm","March 2, 2024 - 10:00"
187,UBS Senior Banker Behind Novel Debt Swaps Is Said to Leave,"(Bloomberg) — A senior banker at UBS Group AG best known for his role in pioneering debt-for-nature swaps has left the firm, according to people familiar with the matter.Ramzi Issa, who had been global head of credit investor products structuring at Credit Suisse before being appointed head of global structured credit and sustainable credit products at UBS one year ago, is no longer working at the Swiss bank, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing the development before it’s made public.A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment. Issa didn’t respond to a request for comment.Issa was among a select group of former Credit Suisse bankers who made it into top roles at UBS after it acquired its troubled Swiss rival last year. Bloomberg reported in August that UBS is working to help raise funds for a $300 million debt swap for Barbados, marking its first foray into a market Issa helped build back in 2021.Debt-for-nature swaps are intended to help developing economies refinance existing debt on better terms, and then put part of the savings toward nature conservation. The Barbados swap on which UBS is currently working will focus on funding climate-resilient infrastructure. Before its 2023 acquisition by UBS, Credit Suisse said it had arranged swaps to restructure about $2.3 billion of debt for governments spanning Belize to Ecuador. Those deals resulted in some $680 million of new financing dedicated to nature conservation, according to the bank.Meanwhile, debt-for-nature swaps have emerged as a key financial instrument for promoting biodiversity. The market is now set to benefit from a plan by six nonprofits to construct a shared pipeline of deals that will be shaped by common standards, according to an announcement this week at the United Nations biennial biodiversity summit, COP16. They say such swaps could unlock up to $100 billion in climate and nature finance.(Adds reference to COP16 agreement in final paragraph.)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","November 1, 2024 - 08:55"
188,Zurich Insurance to Halt Coverage of New Fossil-Fuel Exposures,"(Bloomberg) — Zurich Insurance Group AG will no longer underwrite new oil and gas projects, and is cracking down on clients planning to expand in metallurgical coal mining.The restrictions also entail asking the highest-emitting corporate customers to reduce their carbon footprints, the company told Bloomberg. Further details of the policy will be included in the insurer’s climate-transition plan, which will be announced later this year.Sierra Signorelli, chief executive of commercial insurance at Zurich, said the decision reflects the disconnect between such activities and the insurer’s overall goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. “Further exploration and development of fossil fuels isn’t required for the transition,” she said in an interview. “We think it’s the right time to evolve our position.”The move represents a meaningful policy shift for a company that currently insures fossil-fuel infrastructure spanning North Sea drilling to US natural gas terminals. Exposure to such clients generated about $2.1 billion in premiums for Zurich last year, including its alternative energy business. That’s equivalent to 7% of the insurer’s total commercial premiums. Zurich says its policy update is limited to new fossil-fuel projects, and that it will continue to underwrite existing ones. The company also says the measures are unlikely to have a significant impact on its bottom line. The insurance industry has struggled to find a workable balance when it comes to tackling the issue of climate change. Zurich was one of a group of insurers that withdrew from the Net Zero Insurance Alliance last year amid GOP-led attacks questioning the legality of such coalitions. Zurich CEO Mario Greco has since spoken out about the move, calling such climate alliances “political and bureaucratic.” Instead, he said in an August interview that “every company needs to stand for what they believe in” and not “hide behind” alliances.Read More: Zurich Insurance CEO Criticizes Climate Clubs After Exodus Net Zero Insurance Alliance Founding MembersZurich has previously faced criticism for backing new oil and gas extraction projects. In a 2023 ranking of about 30 insurers’ fossil-fuel policies, the Swiss firm came in seventh, having dropped from fourth place in 2020, according to an annual scorecard published by the Insure Our Future campaign.Nora Scheel, a climate campaigner at Swiss nonprofit Campax, which contributed to the Insure Our Future scorecard, said the new restrictions planned by Zurich mark an “important step” that will help bring the firm closer in line with some of its European peers.Zurich plans to target 65 corporate clients this year that have the highest insurance-associated emissions, and expand that engagement to 450 of its largest customers by 2030. It wants all oil and gas customers to set interim emissions targets, to make clear and measurable commitments, and to present a credible strategy to achieve net zero by 2050. Signorelli said clients should expect to be asked to demonstrate “meaningful investment” toward net zero goals, “not just a PowerPoint presentation.” If Zurich doesn’t see real progress, “we would view exiting customers as a path of last resort,” she said. Insurers will play a crucial role determining the speed and direction of the transition toward cleaner and more sustainable fuels. Few projects, whether based on fossil fuels or renewable energy sources, can get off the ground without insurance protection.In addition to its new restrictions on some fossil-fuel clients, Zurich intends to provide more cover for newer forms of clean-energy infrastructure, including carbon capture and hydrogen power.Signorelli said the insurer plans to expand in this area while “knowing we’re going to take some risks.”NZIA is a part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.

189,Fed’s Rate-Cut Delay Won’t Hold Back the Tide of Global Easing,"(Bloomberg) — Global policymakers aren’t about to let the Federal Reserve’s delay in cutting interest rates distract them too much from their own easing efforts. Among the 23 of the world’s top central banks featured in Bloomberg’s quarterly guide, only the Bank of Japan won’t end up lowering borrowing costs within the next 18 months. Most are already set to do so this year.In total, 155 basis points will be removed from an aggregate benchmark global rate compiled by Bloomberg Economics by the end of 2025. Even the Fed itself, whose plans for cuts in borrowing costs went awry in the face of stubborn US inflation, will still end up delivering a couple of moves this year, the forecasts show.What is clear by now is that prospects are dwindling for a swift removal of the unprecedented global tightening delivered during the post-pandemic cost-of-living crisis. In tandem with the caution of their US peers, central bankers worried about lingering consumer-price pressures are seen adopting a far gentler trajectory downwards for rates than they did on the way up.Easing throughout the advanced world is also turning out to be relatively unsynchronized. In Europe for example, the Swiss National Bank has already cut rates twice this year, the European Central Bank has moved once, the Bank of England has yet to do so and Norwegian officials just signaled that they’re unlikely to act before 2025.The global easing push could still suffer further setbacks, as the Fed and ECB have already shown. Australia’s central bank isn’t even ruling out another hike. What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Post-pandemic inflation has ripped up the central bank playbook. The normal ‘up on the escalator, down on the elevator’ pattern has been reversed, with rates rising swiftly and falling slowly. The Fed’s pull as a global anchor appears diminished, with the ECB, SNB and many emerging markets charting their own course. The overall picture is cuts coming later, slower and less synchronized than expected at the start of the year.”—Tom Orlik, global chief economistBut with the second half of the year dawning, the prospect of looser constriction looks increasingly likely to materialize for much of the world. Here is Bloomberg’s guide to the outlook for central banks that set rates for a combined 90% of the global economy.GROUP OF SEVENUS Federal ReserveFed officials have penciled in one rate cut this year, according to the median projection released in June, and all eyes will be watching for clues about whether that could come during the third quarter, toward the end of the year instead, or perhaps even later.Policymakers have been offering a cautious outlook about the timing for the start of easing after data in early 2024 stoked fears of stalling progress on lowering inflation. But some Fed officials have highlighted more recent figures that suggest pressures are again weakening. A key measure of underlying growth in consumer prices slowed in May for the second straight month.Still, some officials have said it’s important not to overemphasize a few encouraging inflation prints. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed policymakers will be relying on a range of data, including on the labor market and prices, as they decide when it will be appropriate to lower rates.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Inflation surprised to the high side early in 2024, and June’s dot plot showed one 25-basis-point cut this year. However, Powell has said ‘unexpected’ labor-market weakening could prompt faster cuts. We see unemployment rising to 4.2% by September, and even with core PCE inflation still above target, the Fed will likely start easing then. We expect cuts in September and December, for a total of 50 bps this year, followed by 100 bps of cuts in 2025.”—Anna WongFOMC Members See Fewer Cuts This Year Than We DoEuropean Central BankHaving lowered rates in June for the first time since its spate of hikes, the ECB isn’t rushing to do more just yet.Inflation, while still in a gradual retreat, won’t sustainably hit the 2% target until near the end of 2025, according to the central bank’s latest batch of quarterly projections unveiled by President Christine Lagarde.Wage growth, particularly in the services sector, is keeping consumer-price gains elevated and officials nervous about loosening monetary policy too hastily. A rate cut at their next meeting in July is all but ruled out. That makes September the next opportunity to move. What Bloomberg Economics Says:“After upticks in its official time series on negotiated wages, services inflation and compensation per employee, the ECB is reluctant to cut again without more evidence that cost pressures are easing. We expect a pause in July, but slower wage growth in 2Q24 should unlock more action in September. That may be followed by another move in December, when headline inflation is likely to be below target, making such a restrictive stance hard to justify.”—David PowellBank of JapanThe BOJ’s highlight for this quarter could come as early as July. Governor Kazuo Ueda is set to unveil a plan for quantitative tightening that reduces bond buying at that month’s gathering. A simultaneous rate hike can’t be ruled out.Currencies are likely to keep complicating the BOJ’s job. The weak yen has already weighed on households and small businesses by inflating import costs, which is one reason the economy contracted twice in the past three quarters. Japan’s finance ministry has conducted the biggest ever intervention to support the yen in late April and early May.There are growing market views that sooner or later it will be the BOJ’s turn to take action to support the currency.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The BOJ appears determined to normalize policy. It has a strong conviction that Japan is snapping out of a decades-long period of stagnant prices. Another major motivation is to get rates away from the ‘zero-lower-bound’ to get more flexibility. We think it wants to secure a policy cushion while the CPI readings are solid. We expect the BOJ to raise its rate target by 15 bps to 0.15%-0.25% in July, then to 0.4%-0.5% in October.”—Taro KimuraBank of EnglandThe BOE teed up a potential August rate cut at its Monetary Policy Committee meeting on June 20. Although the panel voted to leave rates unchanged at 5.25%, two of the nine members wanted an immediate quarter point reduction and, for at least three others, the decision was “finely balanced,” which would give the doves a majority. The June decision was complicated by the UK election on July 4, with party campaigns in full swing. Although the MPC said that that vote “was not relevant” to the decision, the timing was inconvenient.Economists believe the principal obstacles to lower rates remain sticky service prices and wage growth, which the BOE is using to measure underlying pressures. Inflation is back at the 2% target but the central bank forecasts it to start rising again before the end of the year.The strengthening economy, with the BOE projecting 0.5% growth in the second quarter after 0.7% in the first, is unlikely to delay a decision to cut rates because officials believe policy will remain in “restrictive” territory even after the easing cycle begins.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The BOE has sounded increasingly dovish in recent months, suggesting an August rate cut, which is our base case, is firmly on the table. The shift in tone has occurred despite services inflation showing signs of stickiness. We think upcoming data releases would need to surprise materially to the upside for the start of the easing cycle to be delayed. A second cut is likely to follow in November.”—Dan Hanson Bank of CanadaIn June, the Bank of Canada led the Group of Seven central banks into easing monetary policy, cutting the benchmark overnight rate to 4.75% after it saw mounting evidence of slowing price pressures. At the time, Governor Tiff Macklem said it was “reasonable” to expect further rate cuts if disinflation continued, fueling speculation that the bank was about to start a sustained divergence in policy from the Fed. Since then, inflation data has reversed course — in May, the yearly change in the consumer price index surged back to 2.9% and core pressures regained momentum, raising questions about how long officials will have to wait before cutting further.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Robust domestic demand and indicators suggesting a near-term acceleration in spending mean the pace of rate cuts this year should be slow. We expect the BoC to cut policy rates at a quarterly pace, bringing the overnight rate target to 4.25% at year-end. The potential for further downside inflation surprises skew risks for the policy rate lower. But swift rate cuts — amid population growth as a consequence of immigration — could reenergize home prices and risk a secondary inflation surge.”—Stuart PaulBRICS CENTRAL BANKSPeople’s Bank of ChinaPBOC officials are walking on a tightrope as they try to balance the need to prop up the currency and stimulate the economy. The Fed’s rate-cut delay continues to pressure the yuan. Meanwhile, China’s growth recovery remains lopsided, with exports and the broader industrial sector rebounding faster than consumption, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. Many economists still see the PBOC lowering rates this year, but not until the Fed gives a clearer signal of rate cut plans.The PBOC could also be preparing for a major shift in how it manages money and liquidity, though the changes hinted by Governor Pan Gongsheng may not necessarily help address immediate problems such as deflation and weak borrowing demand.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The PBOC’s extended rate hold despite economic weakness has fired up a debate over the reason. Pan’s remarks in mid-June made it clear concerns about exchange-rate stability have dominated policy deliberations. This reinforces our view that the next window for the PBOC to reduce rates is September, when our US team sees the Fed starting its easing cycle. Lower US rates may make it less likely that a PBOC rate cut will hurt the yuan.”—Chang ShuReserve Bank of IndiaThe RBI paused in June for the eighth straight review, awaiting inflation to ease further. But two rate setters in the six-member monetary policy committee voted for a cut and change in stance, indicating a pivot is being discussed more actively. Governor Shaktikanta Das had said that a shift could be considered when the RBI is sure that inflation, which is moderating but not fast enough, will settle around its target 4% on a durable basis. At an event on June 18, he said it will be “too premature” to consider changing the stance and advocated shunning “any kind of adventurism.”That may translate into a longer wait for rates to come down from a four-year high of 6.5%. The July budget will be crucial to gauge if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pursuing a loose fiscal policy to gain popularity after his party lost its majority in Parliament in the recently concluded elections. That will probably put pressure on the central bank to ease too without waiting for the Fed to cut rates first.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Growing calls for a rate cut on the RBI’s rate setting committee is a clear sign of a policy pivot ahead. The consensus is for no sooner than October, but our analysis of dissent patterns suggests an earlier start in August. Slowing growth, retreating inflation and capital inflows stemming from India’s inclusion in a key bond index should allow the RBI to cut by 50 basis points before year-end, regardless of what the Fed does.”—Abhishek GuptaCentral Bank of BrazilBrazil is expected to keep borrowing costs steady through most of 2025 after policymakers unanimously voted to halt their easing campaign on June 19. The show of unity was seen as an attempt to assuage investors who started questioning the bank’s inflation-fighting credentials in May, when all four board members appointed by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva were against the decision to slow down the pace of rate cuts. By the end of the year, Lula will have appointed the majority of the board’s nine members.The interruption of rate cuts is fueling more political tension between the government and the monetary authority. After the decision, Lula escalated his attacks against central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto, describing him as a “political adversary” who seeks to hurt the economy with high rates.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“We expect Brazil’s central bank to stay on hold until mid-2025, when it resumes a gradual easing and brings rates close to their neutral level by year-end. Realistic revenue estimates and restrained spending in the 2025 federal budget proposal due at the end of August would ease market concern on the fiscal outlook. Market-friendly appointments to three seats on the BCB board opening up at year-end could help tame inflation expectations and pave the way for cuts in 2025.”—Adriana DupitaBank of RussiaThe Bank of Russia looks poised to start the third quarter by hiking its key rate, which has been held at 16% so far this year. While analysts had earlier expected monetary easing to begin in the second half, accelerating inflation that reached 8.3% in May — more than double the bank’s target — is forcing policymakers into a rethink.Governor Elvira Nabiullina warned in June of the possibility of a “significant” hike at the July rate meeting if inflationary pressures don’t start to ease. Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to overheat the economy and stoke inflation, with persistent labor shortages fueling a salary race and government spending on the rise.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Markets are likely to pressure the Bank of Russia into hiking the policy rate as high as 18% over the summer — with swaps expecting rates to peak at 19% this year. The sovereign-debt market and Russian households increasingly are convinced the central bank won’t bring inflation back to its 4% target in coming years. Recent upside inflation surprises only reinforced high inflation expectations. To rebuild its credibility, the Bank of Russia will likely raise the policy rate to 17% in July.”—Alexander IsakovRussian Markets See Policy Rate Reaching 19%South African Reserve BankThe SARB is set to maintain borrowing costs at 8.25% for a while longer, although a path to rate cuts may be opening. A stronger rand fueled by the formation of a market-friendly coalition government after May 29 elections failed to produce an outright winner, and easing price pressures will help moderate inflation toward the central bank’s desired 4.5% goal.Governor Lesetja Kganyago has vowed that the bank will only adjust course on rates once inflation, currently at 5.2%, is at the midpoint of its 3%-6% target range.“We will continue to deliver on that mandate, irrespective of how our post-election politics plays out,” he said recently.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The SARB is set to start trimming its policy rate later this year. A new market-friendly coalition government promises cooler food inflation and a stronger rand. That, in turn, is likely to help push headline inflation down to the mid-point of the central bank’s 3-6% target by 4Q24, prompting policymakers to kick off their easing cycle with a 25-basis-point rate cut in November.”—Yvonne MhangoMINT CENTRAL BANKSBanco de MexicoAn unexpected currency crisis triggered by post-election uncertainties is the latest obstacle for Mexico’s central bank to keep easing monetary policy. Banxico, as the bank is known, started its easing cycle with a quarter-point cut in March, but hasn’t been able to deliver additional reductions since then.The outlook has been complicated by inflation that’s accelerating again and by delays in the Fed’s own easing campaign, which has strong implications for the economy of its southern neighbor. Yet Banxico Governor Victoria Rodriguez remains hopeful that a more stable peso combined with slower core inflation will allow the bank to cut rates in the coming months. What Bloomberg Economics Says:“We expect decelerating inflation, weaker domestic demand and lower US rates to open the door for Banxico to cut in the second half, after it opted for a single, 25-basis-point reduction in the first. Persistent core price gains and inflation expectations as well as risks from potential constitutional reforms and the US elections in November limit its room to maneuver.”—Felipe HernandezBank IndonesiaThe prospect of further rate hikes still looms large over Bank Indonesia despite policymakers’ signals that its next move will likely be a cut. Among the few major central banks whose main mandate is currency stability, BI may be forced to tighten monetary policy anew despite low inflation as the rupiah continues its slide to four-year lows.Repeated market interventions will be limited by the central bank’s foreign-exchange reserves. Meanwhile, BI’s sale of high-yielding securities has proved insufficient to turn the tide on foreign flows, with investors still jittery over the incoming government’s plans to pursue looser spending and higher debt. There may be little respite for the currency until the Fed finally pivots and Indonesia’s new administration clarifies its fiscal stance when it takes power in October.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Bank Indonesia is likely to cut rates by 25 bps in 2024, but it won’t move until after the Fed starts easing. Jumping the gun would narrow the rate differential – undercutting the rupiah, which it’s worked hard to prop up. Capital inflows are also vulnerable to concerns that fiscal policy won’t be as prudent under the new government, which takes the helm in October. This likely keeps the BI rate unchanged in 3Q24.”—Tamara HendersonCentral Bank of TurkeyAfter keeping its rate on hold for a third straight month, the Turkish central bank’s eyes will be on June’s inflation print. Though headline inflation is set to slow from a peak of above 75% in May, the bank’s preferred gauge is monthly readings. Domestic demand is still too high for officials’ liking, and rate cuts are not expected to be on the table until the end of the year. The monetary authority has pledged to preserve a tight stance until a sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly price growth. Investors are also seeking bolder steps on the fiscal side to aid the disinflation efforts.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The CBRT’s rates may have peaked already in March at 50%, but its tightening cycle is far from over. We expect the central bank to restrict financial conditions further via alternative tools, such as higher reserve requirements, likely through 3Q24. We see a total of 500 bps of cuts in 4Q24, but risks to the inflation outlook including outsized mid-year tax hikes may delay the expected kickoff to rate cuts.”—Selva Bahar BazikiFew Points of Agreement on Turkey Rates OutlookCentral Bank of NigeriaSigns that decades-high inflation may be peaking, and relative stability in the naira, suggest the Central Bank of Nigeria’s unprecedented tightening cycle is nearing an end. The bank has lifted rates by 1,475 basis points since May 2022.While Governor Olayemi Cardoso wouldn’t be drawn in a recent Bloomberg TV interview on whether that could be as soon as the Monetary Policy Committee’s next meeting in July, he did say the central bank is “relatively pleased” with the results so far in addressing currency volatility.Data will direct whether the panel sees the need for further hikes or not, he added. “The MPC has been very clear in stating that they see inflation as a major impediment for the future of Nigeria, and they will do everything possible to ensure that they keep inflation in check and in fact bring it down as reasonably as they can and I don’t see that changing,” Cardoso observed.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Nigeria’s monetary policy rate is nearing its peak. Rhetoric from the central bank suggests policymakers believe they are winning the fight against price gains. Inflation has indeed slowed — our forecast shows it topping out just under 35% in mid-2024 — on moderating food price gains. We expect the rate hiking cycle to conclude at around 27% in July, followed by a pause. Policymakers will likely keep rates on hold until the end of 2024.”—Yvonne MhangoOTHER G-20 CENTRAL BANKSBank of KoreaThe BOK could be among the first in Asia to join the ECB and the Bank of Canada in making a policy pivot if inflation slows as expected later this year. In May, the central bank kept the door open for a rate cut by leaving its consumer-price forecast unchanged, even as it raised its economic growth projection.Governor Rhee Chang-yong said June 18 the BOK could give a clearer outlook when the board meets in July. A growing number of economists expect a cut in August. Still, concerns about a rate differential with the US and its effect on the won could make the BOK wait longer until the Fed acts more firmly.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The Bank of Korea is gearing up for an easing cycle as inflation slows. We expect it to start cutting rates in August but concerns about won depreciation linked to moves by the Fed could shift the timing. It will probably proceed only gradually due to worries about stoking excessive private-sector debt.The BOK will probably also use liquidity tools and lending programs to ease property market risks, lessening the need for deeper rate cuts.”—Hyosung KwonReserve Bank of AustraliaThe RBA increased rates by less than key developed-world counterparts during the 2022-23 tightening cycle, and as a result is likely to have to keep them higher for longer to return inflation to target. Governor Michele Bullock certainly isn’t ready to talk about easing yet. Indeed, following the June policy meeting she restated that the board isn’t “ruling anything in or out,” a signal that another hike may still be on the table.Economists and money markets see the risk of a hike at the bank’s next meeting in August though the broader consensus is that the next move will be down — though not until 2025. That will likely make the RBA one of the last major institutions to embark on an easing cycle. Before its Aug. 5-6 meeting, the RBA will have seen a key second-quarter inflation reading; an unexpected spike in prices could yet force its hand on a hike one last time.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Recent upside surprises in the monthly inflation data have raised the risk of the Reserve Bank making one more hike as insurance. That would come at a cost to growth – with the economy already weak. The 2Q inflation reading will be a make-or-break catalyst for the August decision. We think the RBA has done enough and the next rates move is down, potentially as early as 4Q.”—James McIntyreCentral Bank of ArgentinaArgentina’s central bank has been cutting rates aggressively — from 133% when President Javier Milei took office to 40% currently — even as consumer prices continue to rise at an annual clip of 276%. The negative real interest rate is part of a government strategy to reduce central bank liabilities by forcing investors into Treasury notes that pay higher yields.Monthly inflation has slowed down to 4.2% in May, a level not seen since 2022, but the relief may be short-lived as the removal of generous energy subsidies is expected to put pressure on prices again. The International Monetary Fund has also said Argentina will eventually need to have positive real interest rates to encourage savings in peso and to avoid dollar outflows when the government lifts capital controls.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“President Javier Milei has made strides on his reform agenda. Next he must lift currency controls and regain access to global capital markets. Argentina may not be ready yet that – the BCRA still has to clean up its balance sheet and reserves are too low to end the controls. Once those are eased or lifted, the next step is positive real rates – they’ve been negative since Milei took office.”—Adriana DupitaG-10 CURRENCIES AND EAST EUROPE ECONOMIESSwiss National BankThe SNB cut rates already in March, pre-empting peers such as the ECB in the neighboring euro zone.With inflation only at 1.4% — lower than in many other jurisdictions — and forecast to fall further over the year, officials have had fewer impediments to acting than elsewhere.SNB decisions are scheduled only for once every quarter. Officials reduced borrowing costs again in June, and the question for policymakers now is whether they will extend their easing cycle in September or wait even longer.Against that backdrop, a changing of the guard is imminent at the central bank. Vice President Martin Schlegel will succeed Thomas Jordan to the top job in October. Having spend his career working closely with the current president, he’s seen by observers as unlikely to make major changes in monetary.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The SNB delivered a second consecutive rate cut, to 1.25%, in June, as political uncertainty in Europe added upside risks to the currency. With policy close to neutral, the SNB is likely to move slower from now – we expect a final rate cut, to 1%, in December, although September remains a possibility, particularly if uncertainty remains high in Europe. The nomination of Schlegel to replace Jordan from October will ensure policy continuity.”—Maeva CousinSveriges RiksbankThe Riksbank is gaining confidence that inflation won’t exceed its 2% target, and now sees it as likely that it can cut its benchmark rate two or three times more in the second half of the year.Governor Erik Thedeen and his colleagues were emboldened to chart a slightly more dovish path at their monetary policy meeting last week after seeing that the Swedish krona wasn’t hit by their decision to make the first easing move before the ECB.Still, the world’s oldest central bank continues to underline the need to unwind constriction in a gradual manner, and a volatile krona remains a risk that could upend its plans, should the currency weaken to an extent that has a tangible effect on inflation through higher import prices. The bank has four monetary policy meetings left before year-end, and an inflation print published July 12 will be important for its next decision, due to be announced on August 20.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Having kicked off its easing cycle already in May, the Riksbank is flirting with the idea of three more cuts this year, up from its earlier signaling for two. That invites currency weakness when other major central banks deliver messages of hawkish leaning. This adds to reasons why we think the central bank will not be in a position to deliver more than a cut per quarter ahead, taking the end-year rate to 3.25%.”—Selva Bahar BazikiThe Riksbank Only Sees Cuts AheadNorges BankNorway’s central bank may extend its rate pause until next year after a stronger-than-expected economic outlook and wage growth prompted Norges Bank to scrap its plan to start easing in September.The energy-rich Nordic economy has proven more resilient to borrowing costs at 4.5% — the highest level since 2008 — and stickier inflation than projected by Governor Ida Wolden Bache and colleagues. At their latest meeting, officials raised their forecasts for economic expansion and pay increases this year and next.While the strengthening of the krone from its weak levels has brought some relief to policymakers after recent worries about imported inflation, they still revised higher estimates for long-term underlying inflation, with their 2%-target remaining out of reach even by 2027. Norges Bank’s latest plans confirm its reputation as one of the more aggressively hawkish rich-world central banks, in contrast with most other regional peers including neighboring Sweden and the euro zone that have already started easing.Reserve Bank of New ZealandThe RBNZ is talking tough, saying it won’t cut rates until the second half of 2025 to make sure sticky domestic inflation is vanquished. But almost all observers think it will be pressed into action much sooner than that amid mounting signs of economic gloom. While New Zealand exited recession with 0.2% growth in the first quarter, that may prove to be a temporary reprieve. With consumer and business confidence in the doldrums, economists predict the economy will shrink again in the three months through June. That would make it five contractions in the past seven quarters.Investors are betting rate cuts will start in November this year, and most local economists predict easing will begin in early 2025.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The RBNZ joined the high-for-longer bandwagon in May, but its hawkish stance is unrealistic and won’t last long. The economy just barely climbed out of recession in 1Q, and activity indicators suggest significant headwinds going forward. Strong immigration has been propping up demand but this will fade. We see rate cuts coming in late 2024, as the focus switches from fighting inflation to reviving growth.”—James McIntyreNational Bank of PolandPoland’s central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged for the rest of the year as double-digit growth in wages worries policymakers in Warsaw.While inflation has reached the 2.5% target, the concern is that it will flare up later in the year as the government removes remaining crisis-era measures that have held down energy prices. Lackluster economic recovery may still swing the majority in favor of cuts earlier, but officials have coalesced around the view that monetary easing may wait until early next year. Beyond inflation, Governor Adam Glapinski will seek to fend off a parliamentary probe that the ruling coalition has launched into his conduct before last year’s election. The governor has denied any wrong doing.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Poland is likely to lag the ECB’s easing cycle and won’t cut until 4Q. Policymakers’ focus will remain on core inflation and the strength of the recovery. Recent downside inflation and growth surprises may nudge the monetary-policy committee toward a more dovish stance. We expect the central bank to cut the reference rate to 5.0% by end-2025 as inflation stabilizes around the 2.5% target level.”—Alexander IsakovPoland Rate Cuts to Lag ECB’s This YearCzech National BankThe Czechs have signaled they’re likely to slow or may even halt monetary easing — after four consecutive rate cuts by half a percentage point — in the second half of the year as officials aim to prevent inflation from staging a comeback.While consumer price growth has stabilized near the 2% target, Governor Ales Michl and his colleagues see potential risks in wage growth, rising cost of services and a lending recovery. “The bank board considers it necessary to persist with tight monetary policy and carefully consider any further rate cuts, approaching them with great caution,” Michl said after the last 50 basis-point reduction on June 27.–With assistance from Scott Johnson (Economist), Beril Akman, Philip Aldrick, Michael S.

192,"In Gaza, starving children fill hospital wards as famine looms","By Mohammad Salem and Gabrielle Tétrault-FarberGAZA/GENEVA (Reuters) – Six-year-old Fadi al-Zant is acutely malnourished, his ribs protruding under leathery skin, his eyes sunken as he lays in bed at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, where famine is bearing down.Fadi’s spindly legs can no longer support him enough to walk.Photographs of Fadi from before the war show a smiling, healthy-looking child, standing in blue denims next to his taller twin with his hair brushed. A short video clip shows him dancing at a wedding with a little girl.Fadi suffers from cystic fibrosis. Before the conflict, he was taking medicine that his family can no longer find and eating a carefully balanced variety of food no longer available in the Palestinian enclave, according to his mother Shimaa al-Zant.“His condition is getting worse. He is getting weaker. He keeps losing his ability to do things,” she said in a video obtained by Reuters from a freelancer. “He can no longer stand. When I help him stand up, he falls straight away.”More than five months into Israel’s ground and air campaign, launched in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, there are widespread shortages of food, medicines and clean water in Gaza, doctors and aid agencies say.The Kamal Adwan hospital, caring for Fadi, had also treated most of the 27 children the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says have died of malnutrition and dehydration in recent weeks.Others died in Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital, also in the north, the ministry said, and in the southernmost city of Rafah, where the U.N. relief agency says over 1 million Palestinians have sought refuge from Israel’s offensive.Reuters saw 10 badly malnourished children during a visit last week to the al-Awda health centre in Rafah, arranged with nursing staff who gave the news agency unimpeded access to the ward. Reuters was not able to independently verify the deaths reported by the ministry.Without urgent action, famine will hit between now and May in northern Gaza, where 300,000 people are trapped by fighting, the world’s hunger watchdog, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), said in a review on Monday.The review’s most likely scenario said “extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and mortality” were imminent for more than two thirds of the people in the north. The IPC is made up of U.N. agencies and global aid groups.Israel’s COGAT, the military body that handles aid transfers to Gaza, did not specifically respond to Reuters questions about the deaths of children from hunger and dehydration. It said Israel put no limits on the amount of aid that can enter.Following the IPC review, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy posted on X that the number of food trucks had increased in March and that Israel was taking measures to bolster “delivery efforts” to the north.“It’s a bad assessment, based on an out of date picture,” he said of the review.The White House referred Reuters to comments from National Security advisor Jake Sullivan, who said responsibility to address impending famine “starts, first and foremost, with Israel.”USAID chief Samantha Power said the IPC assessment marked “a horrific milestone” and called on Israel to open more land routes.In response to a question from Reuters about the IPC report, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Israel’s Prime Minister Binyamin Netenyahu was “defying the world and pursuing the killing of the Palestinian people in Gaza by bombs and starvation.”U.N. aid agencies have said “overwhelming obstacles” to moving aid to the north of Gaza will only be overcome with a ceasefire and the opening of border crossings closed by Israel after Oct. 7.DISPLACEDIn better times, Fadi’s favourite food was chicken shawarma, a Levantine grill dish, his mother said, and he ate a lot of fruit and drank a lot of milk.When the war began, she said, the family fled their home in al-Nasr district of Gaza City, which suffered widespread damage from bombardment. They were displaced four times before arriving in Beit Lahia, she added.Fadi’s condition began to deteriorate about two months ago and he was admitted to Kamal Adwan hospital, Zant said. Creon – the medicine that people with cystic fibrosis need to supplement pancreatic enzymes that help digest food – was not available. Sometimes, Fadi had diarrhoea 10 times in one night.Before the war, the child weighed 30kg (66 lb). Now he weighs just 12kg (26 lb), his mother said.“He used to eat well. His treatment was available. His face was full. He was a child that did not seem ill. He went to kindergarten with his brother,” she said.COGAT did not respond to a question about the availability of Creon, but said Israel had “not refused a single shipment of medical supplies.”Reuters was not able to independently establish if any such shipments had been blocked, or verify with hospital officials the extent to which Creon supplies were disrupted.The Gaza health ministry says lack of medication contributed to the deterioration of the conditions of the children who died.As well as for children like Fadi who have pre-exisiting medical conditions, risks are rapidly rising for many others in Gaza, U.N. agencies say.The U.N. children’s agency UNICEF said on Friday that nearly 1 in 3 children under two years old in northern Gaza suffer from acute malnutrition, twice as many as in January.In shelters and health centres visited by UNICEF and its partners, 4.5% of children had severe wasting, the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, it said.“Unless fighting stops and aid agencies have full access throughout Gaza then hundreds if not thousands more children could die of hunger,” UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said on Tuesday in a joint statement with the World Food Programme.If Israel goes ahead with a promised offensive in Rafah, 1.1 million people in Gaza, half the population, are expected to face an extreme lack of food, in which starvation and death are present in households, the IPC report said.Last Thursday, COGAT’s Col. Elad Goren told reporters access to food was stable in the south and centre of the enclave.Human Rights Watch said in late February that Israel was obstructing the provision of basic services as well as the entry and distribution of fuel and lifesaving aid in Gaza. It said this was “collective punishment,” considered a war crime under international humanitarian law.COGAT told Reuters that Israel was making “extensive efforts to increase the amount of aid that enters Gaza,” above and beyond its obligations.“Any claims otherwise, including claims regarding collective punishment, are baseless in both fact and law,” it said.RAFAHAt al-Awda health centre in Rafah, more than a dozen women sat or stood tending their malnourished children.Most of the children in the ward already had medical problems before the war, their relatives said, though pictures that the parents of two of them showed Reuters showed them looking notably healthier than now.On March 4, 12-year-old Yazan al-Kafarna, who had cerebral palsy, died in southern Gaza, days after Reuters took photographs that showed his severe emaciation.The ward nurse, Amira Abu Juwaiyad, said the hospital was unable to get enough milk for babies and that 10-15 cases were coming in daily under “catastrophic” conditions. Abu Juwaiyad did not say how much milk was available prior to the war.Umm Mesbah Heji sat cradling her five-year-old daughter Israa, who is quadriplegic and epileptic.Israa’s medications are no longer available and she has lost a lot of weight. Before the war, Heji used to feed her eggs and milk for breakfast, liver for lunch and rice for dinner, she said. Sometimes, she gave her yoghurt and fruit.“I know she’s hungry. The food she eats isn’t available,” she said, adding that every day “I die one hundred times” feeling sad for her daughter.DIARRHOEADisease is aggravating the dire lack of food. Dehydration from diarrhoea, which the World Health Organisation says is rampant in the mass tent cities where displaced people cram together without proper sewage or clean water, hastens malnutrition.One effect of acute hunger is to reduce immunity against such gastric diseases.The WHO said last month that 90% of children under 5 in Gaza were affected by one or more infectious diseases with 70% having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks – a 23-fold increase over cases before the war.Kerstin Hanson, a U.S. doctor working on nutrition with international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, described the physical onset of malnutrition and dehydration.Children grow lethargic and less responsive. Their skin loses its puffiness so that if pushed out of shape it may stay in that position. The eyes get sunken. The body emaciates.Even for children who were healthy before the conflict, sustained malnutrition can stunt physical and brain development.As acute malnutrition takes hold, a child’s body stops growing, Hanson said. Then it shuts down everything except vital functions. “Your heart and lungs will keep functioning, but … maybe there isn’t enough energy to keep your immune system functioning,” she said.After that, the body would “kind of start eating itself”, using muscle, fat and anywhere else it could find energy to keep breathing and pumping blood. Eventually, it would just shut down.Even when malnutrition does not reach that dangerous stage, its effects on development might be impossible to reverse if it is sustained, Hanson said. Children may never recover lost centimetres of growth.","March 20, 2024 - 00:01"

194,Switzerland-EU: draft negotiating mandate approved by second committee,"It welcomes the overall approach based on a package of agreements but makes additional demands.The committee was particularly critical of Switzerland’s closer institutional ties with the EU, the planned dispute settlement mechanism, the draft agreement on electricity and the adoption of the directive on European citizenship. However, after weighing up all the interests, the committee approved the draft by nine votes to three, with one abstention, parliament’s services reported on Tuesday.The result of the exploratory talks constitutes “a good basis for conducting negotiations and reaching a satisfactory outcome that not only takes Swiss interests into account, but also contributes to long-term legal certainty”, according to the committee.In addition to the global approach based on a package of agreements, it welcomes the inclusion of institutional rules in the market access agreements and the abandonment of the “guillotine clause” in future agreements. It considers it important that the rules negotiated on state aid should only apply sectorally in the area or agreement concerned, and should not have a horizontal effect.+ Swiss-EU relations: Bern prepares for a vacuumThe committee also approved the negotiation of new agreements in the electricity, health and food safety sectors, giving Switzerland additional room for manoeuvre.In the electricity sector, the focus should be on cooperation in the areas of grid stability, electricity trade and security of supply. In addition, households and small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) must be able to remain within the protected basic supply. With regard to the land transport agreement, its revision must not be detrimental to national traffic.Should it become apparent that Switzerland’s interests in one of these areas are at risk of being insufficiently protected, or that an agreement remains unsatisfactory, it should be possible to abandon the conclusion of the agreement, without the other areas being affected, notes the committee.It also makes additional demands. It wants any compensation measures to come into force only after the arbitral tribunal has ruled on the question of their proportionality. It is also calling for a contractual guarantee of current production forms and capacities in the electricity sector.The commission is also calling for a number of “clear guarantees against undesirable and possibly unforeseeable developments”. It would like to see a clear procedure governing Switzerland’s participation in European legislation that involves the Federal Assembly.+ More on the current state of Swiss-EU talksIt is also calling for a clear limitation on the jurisdiction of the EU Court of Justice, so that the latter only intervenes indirectly if necessary and at the request of the arbitral tribunal to interpret concepts of EU law. It also insists that the directive on European citizenship be strictly limited to the labour market and that more precise guarantees be provided to prevent the illicit or undesirable obtaining of social benefits.With regard to the free movement of people, the committee calls for clearly defined exceptions for the posting of workers to Switzerland in accordance with the principle of “equal pay for equal work in the same place”. As for European programmes, Switzerland must be fully, rapidly and sustainably involved in Horizon Europe, with transitional and binding arrangements for the remainder of the current period. It must also be involved in Erasmus+.The government must also explain how the agreements will be implemented in terms of domestic policy, for example by involving parliament and by defining the composition of the supervisory authorities. And parliamentary cooperation between the Federal Assembly and the European Parliament must be regulated in the form of an institutionalised exchange. On the question of a referendum, the committee will make its views known once the negotiations have been completed.Translated from German by DeepL/ts","February 13, 2024 - 15:29"
195,German finance minister will soon announce his proposals to boost growth,"By Maria MartinezWASHINGTON (Reuters) – German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said he is working on his own proposals to stimulate growth in Europe’s biggest economy, which will not focus only on industry, but also on other economic sectors.“In the course of this public debate, we will of course also develop our own proposals and present them shortly,” Lindner, of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), told Reuters in an interview on Friday on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings.The Free Democrats are organising their own economic summit next Tuesday, the same day Chancellor Olaf Scholz has invited business groups to the chancellery for an industry summit. Earlier this week, Economy Minister Robert Habeck also laid out his economic plans.“The German economy is not just made up of industry,” Lindner said. Equally important are small and medium-sized enterprises, liberal professions, start-ups and self-employed people, he said. “That’s why we need to have a conversation about their needs, concerns and expectations.”Germany is working on structural reforms with its growth package, which includes 49 measures to boost investment, attract skilled workers and cut red tape, among other topics.The plans must be approved by the upper and lower houses of parliament later this year and Lindner sees resistance in the upper house and among coalition partners for tax relief measures.“The growth initiative is very broad-based, from the labour market to energy policy to tax issues,” Lindner said. “My impression is that tax policy in particular is currently controversial.”Lindner aims to implement personal income tax cuts totalling 23 billion euros ($25 billion) in 2025 and 2026 to mitigate a creeping burden from inflation. The Greens are questioning this measure.Although some measures have already been introduced, Lindner sees the growth package just as a first step.“We need further ambition because the situation of the German economy is not satisfying to say the least,” Lindner said, adding that there should a new Agenda 2030, with a holistic approach to increase Germany’s competitiveness.GERMANY’S ECONOMIC MODELGermany’s industrial sector is in the throes of long-term decline, having lost cheap energy from Russia and facing uncertainty over its once-lucrative trade ties with China. This has set into question Germany’s economic model.Lindner said Germany’s economic model still has a future, but it will transform.“There will be a development in the structure of the German economy but not planned by politicians but driven by market decisions, by demand, by technological progress,” Lindner said.He said Germany has to keep its industrial core, but not by paying subsidies, which would not be sustainable.“I’m convinced Germany will keep an industrial heart,” Lindner said.

196,"Israel moves into north Gaza Hamas stronghold, pounds Rafah without advancing","By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Emily RoseCAIRO/JERUSALEM (Reuters) – Israel’s tanks pushed into the heart of Jabalia in northern Gaza on Thursday, facing anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs from militants concentrated there, while in the south, its forces pounded Rafah without advancing, Palestinian residents and militants said.The slow progress of Israel’s offensive, more than seven months after it was prompted by Hamas’ deadly cross-border raid, highlighted the difficulty of achieving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s aim of eradicating the militant group.Armed wings of Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have been able to fight up and down the Gaza Strip, using heavily fortified tunnels to stage attacks in both the north – the focus of Israel’s initial invasion – and new battlegrounds like Rafah.“We are wearing Hamas down,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said, announcing that more troops would be deployed in Rafah, where he said several tunnels had been destroyed.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri responded that the group would defend its people “by all means”.Israel says four Hamas battalions are now in Rafah along with hostages abducted during the Oct. 7 assault, but it faces international pressure not to invade the city, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians are sheltering.South Africa asked the top U.N. court to order a halt to Israel’s Rafah offensive, saying it was “part of the endgame in which Gaza is utterly destroyed”. Israel has denied South African allegations of genocide in Gaza and said it had complied with an earlier court order to step up aid.The Gaza death toll has risen to 35,272, health officials in the Hamas-run coastal enclave said, and malnutrition is widespread with international aid efforts blocked by the violence and Israel’s de-facto shutdowns of its Kerem Shalom crossing and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.Israel says Hamas is diverting aid and it needs to eliminate the organisation for its own protection after the deaths of 1,200 people on Oct. 7, and to free the 128 hostages still held out of 253 abducted by the militants, according to its tallies.FLOATING PIER ANCHORED, BUT AID PLANS UNCLEARThe United States anchored a temporary floating pier to a beach in Gaza on Thursday to boost aid deliveries, but it was still unclear how it would be distributed given the challenges that have beset the United Nations and relief groups for months.The United Nations stressed that delivering aid by land was the “most viable, effective and efficient” method.“To stave off the horrors of famine, we must use the fastest and most obvious route to reach the people of Gaza – and for that, we need access by land now,” deputy U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq said.“We don’t want ships… we want safety,” said displaced Gazan Hassan Abu Al-Kass, speaking in the central Gaza Strip.The United States State Department said the humanitarian situation in Gaza continued to deteriorate and urged Israel to allow sustained access for aid via the southern and northern parts of the enclave.Israel’s military says its operation in Rafah is meant to kill Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by the group, which governs the blockaded Palestinian territory. Israel accuses Hamas of diverting aid, something it denies.Egyptian sources said Cairo, which fears a mass exodus from Gaza to Egypt, had rejected an Israeli request to coordinate on the reopening of the Rafah border crossing, which Israel seized on May 7, and keep it beyond Palestinian control.Ceasefire and hostage release talks are deadlocked over how to end the war.Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said his group, which has run Gaza since 2007, should continue to have a role while the Palestinian Authority, which Western leaders want to oversee Gaza, said it did not have enough funds to fulfil its current limited governing role in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Israel declared major operations over in northern Gaza months ago while pledging to return to prevent Hamas regrouping.On Thursday, around a week after they moved back in, Israeli tanks were heavily bombarding the main market in the heart of Jabalia, a decades-old refugee camp, and several stores there caught fire, residents and Hamas media outlets said.HAMAS SAYS IT DESTROYED ISRAELI TROOP CARRIEREarlier, the armed wing of Hamas said its fighters in Jabalia had destroyed an Israeli troop carrier with a locally made Al-Yassin 105 anti-tank rocket, causing casualties. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the statement and there was no immediate comment from Israel.“They are bombing like crazy, destroying the houses and the main market in the camp,” one of the camp’s residents told Reuters via a chat app.Residents said tanks had also pushed back to near the entrance to the nearby northern city of Beit Hanoun and Israeli bulldozers were demolishing factories and property in the area.Israel says it has eliminated many gunmen in Jabalia but had no new comment on developments there on Thursday.In the southern tip of Gaza, tanks held their positions in eastern neighbourhoods and outskirts of Rafah while keeping up pressure with aerial and ground bombardments.Medics said one Israeli tank shell had landed in a square deep inside Rafah, killing one Palestinian and wounding others, while residents said clusters of homes on the edge of the city were blown up by the army after evacuation orders.Israel said its strikes were targeted at militants.“We’re operating … where we know Hamas terrorists are hiding, and where we think we can find either tunnel shafts or terror infrastructure or ammunition of many types,” military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said.","May 17, 2024 - 08:49"
197,Japan takes a leading role in removing Ukraine’s landmines,"“Japan will step up its efforts in the areas of mine clearance to enable the Ukrainian people to feel reassured as they reestablish their daily lives,” stressed Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in his speech at the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland in June, also indicating that Japan will host next year’s Ukraine Mine Action Conference (UMAC) which is this year being held in Switzerland.Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Japanese government has continued to provide demining equipment and capacity-building support to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU).In July, the Japanese government and JICA
External link
, the agency mandated to implement technical cooperation programmes, handed over four mechanised demining machines to Ukraine as part of ¥91 billion ($563 million) in grant aid aimed at assisting in its reconstruction.The machines, manufactured by a Japanese construction machinery maker Nikken, are the first of their kind and can also be used for debris removal and tree trimming by replacing the tip of the arm. About 20 units will be delivered by the end of this year.In 2023, Japan also provided Ukraine with 50 state-of-the-art compact landmine detectors developed by Professor Emeritus Motoyuki Sato of Tohoku University. The detectors, dubbed ALIS, combine a metal detector and GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) to visualise buried landmines on a tablet PC screen. The system, which has been used in Cambodia, can quickly and accurately detect the location of landmines without digging into the ground.>>Motoyuki Sato explains in this video how ALIS works:But Japan prefers helping countries affected by land mines build the capacity to address the problem themselves.  So far, JICA has conducted several training sessions for Ukrainian staff in Japan, Cambodia, and Poland. Fifty people from Ukraine have learned how to use and maintain mine detectors and demining equipment.According to the Ukrainian government, about 23% of Ukraine’s land potentially contains landmines and other explosive hazards. Some six million people are currently living in high-risk areas. More than 900 civilians have been killed or injured due to land mines.The war in Ukraine is still ongoing, and even if the war were to end, it would take many more years to clear the mines.“Unlike other countries, we don’t just send people from Japan to help mine clearance. Our goal is to strengthen the capacity of the Ukrainian people so that they can plan and carry out exploration and removal of landmines on their own in the future,” says Ayako Oi, who leads the peacebuilding department at JICA.Since 1998, Japan has provided grant aid totalling more than 16 billion yen (CHF92 million) to Cambodia to assist in mine action. Cambodia was heavily affected by the Vietnam War and the subsequent civil war that lasted 20 years, in which an estimated four to six million mines were buried.Since 1998, JICA has supported the Cambodia Mine Action Center (CMAC), a Cambodian government agency, by providing equipment to improve the efficiency of mine clearance and building organisational management capacity, thereby helping Cambodia establish a system for self-sustained mine clearance.CMAC increased the land area cleared of mines from approximately ten square kilometres in 1995-99 to approximately 282km2 in 2023.Cambodia has now become one of the world’s most knowledgeable countries on mine countermeasures. JICA has been working to facilitate cooperation Cambodian officials and those in countries such as Colombia, Laos, Angola, and Iraq to share expertise.Japan’s Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa recently announced a joint initiative with Cambodia to share knowledge and technology on landmine removal globally. As part of the initiative, Cambodian experts taught Ukrainian staff how to use the mine detectors.Japan is one of the world’s largest donors to mine action, consistently ranking

among the top five donors between 2018 and 2022.Japan has a strictly-regulated arms export policy, especially regarding weapons sent to parties involved in conflicts.Like Switzerland, Japan came under pressure from the international community to relax its arms export policy following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In March 2022, shortly after the invasion began, the Japanese government revised its operational guidelines for The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology
External link
, which allowed Japan to provide Ukraine with bulletproof vests and helmets as “disused items”.At the end of 2023, the government again revised the arms transfer policy, which now enables Japan to export finished defense products made in Japan under foreign licences to the licensing nations. Shortly after, Japan approved a request from the United States for shipment of domestically produced Patriot air defense missiles to the US, prompting speculation they may be sent to Ukraine.As is the case for Switzerland, however, most of Japan’s assistance to Ukraine is in the form of humanitarian and financial aid.The Ukraine Mine Action Conference as a Japanese showcase Mine clearance assistance has therefore become a central part of Japan’s support to Ukraine, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida securing Japan’s hosting of the 2025 Ukraine Mine Action Conference through a meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the G7 Summit.Japanese lawmakers hope that the Ukraine Mine Action Conference will also give Japanese companies opportunities to showcase their innovations in mine action. In addition to Nikken and Komatsu, which have developed cutting-edge demining equipment, IT giant NEC has developed artificial intelligence technology that can predict where landmines are most likely buried. NEC wants to use this technology in Ukraine in the future.“Efforts to eliminate anti-personnel landmines are an essential element in protecting human security, which means creating a society where people can live in peace”, says Ayako Oi, head of JICA’s Peacebuilding department. “And I hope next year’s conference will further accelerate countries’ commitment to mine action in Ukraine.”Edited by Veronica DeVore/ds","October 16, 2024 - 09:40"
198,Analysis-Putin’s economic challenges are numerous but surmountable as election looms,"By Alexander MarrowMOSCOW (Reuters) – Russia’s success in evading a Western oil price cap is helping drive a recovery in economic growth as President Vladimir Putin prepares to run for re-election, despite the problems caused by labour shortages, inflation and high interest rates.Russia’s parliament has formally set next year’s presidential election date for March 17. Putin, who on Thursday said the economy was set to grow 3.5% this year, on Friday said he would run again, a move that could keep him in power until at least 2030.Russia’s export-focused, $2.2-trillion economy has ridden the sanctions wave better than either Moscow or the West anticipated when those opposed to the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine sought to punish and isolate Putin’s Russia.Crucially, the West has been unable to effectively curb Russia’s oil revenues. Russia has redirected exports to destinations such as China and India and used the opaque ownership of so-called shadow fleets of ships to circumvent the West’s oil price cap.In November, energy revenues contributed 961.7 billion roubles ($10.41 billion) to Russia’s budget, compared with just 425.5 billion in January.With oil revenues recovering, Putin’s key domestic challenge will be grappling with a stark labour shortage, aggravated by last year’s military mobilisation and the emigration of hundreds of thousands of people since Russia invaded Ukraine.Other economic issues, such as the weak rouble, high inflation and interest rates risk squeezing households’ purchasing power, a particularly sensitive topic as the country goes to the polls.SKILLED WORKER SHORTAGEWith unemployment at a record low 2.9% and Moscow throwing fiscal resources at the defence sector through increased military production, other sectors like IT are short on staff, hampering productivity.Russia needs more skilled workers, managers and high-quality engineers to reach the desired level of technological sovereignty in manufacturing industries, Putin’s economic adviser Maxim Oreshkin said in November.“For people to come here more willingly, we need attractive salaries,” Oreshkin said.Short-term sanctions shocks have been overcome, Oreshkin said, but pressure from the West will only increase and the whole economy must work on transitioning to Russian technology platforms.Workforce capacity has reached historically high levels, said Dmitry Kulikov, director at the ACRA ratings agency.“This means that economic growth will be constrained on the supply side, as a result of which annual GDP growth rates will fall from around 3% in 2023 to closer to the potential 1-2%,” Kulikov said.Significant wage jumps in manufacturing and the military, as well as fiscal support for families affected by the war and mobilisation, are driving an increase in salaries.After a contraction in 2022, real incomes are set to recover sharply this year, but unevenly across sectors and regions, forcing many families to cut back, especially on imported goods.As Russia’s economy rebounds from a 2.1% contraction in 2022, the key question will be how the economy copes with overheating, with supply-side constraints likely to curb growth, said Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.“Households have experienced a big rise in their incomes, but I don’t think it’s sustainable,” said Peach. “Higher inflation means a bigger squeeze on household incomes ahead of the election.”INFLATION PRESSURE?Keeping a lid on inflation is the central bank’s job. Already forced into 750 basis points of monetary tightening since July, the bank is widely expected to hike again, to 16%, on Dec. 15. Following double-digit inflation in 2022, inflation this year is seen at around 7.5%, still well above the bank’s 4% target.“It’s plausible that inflation gets as high as 10% next year because the economy is growing quickly,” said Peach, pointing to wage pressure and unanchored household inflation expectations.But ultimately, the inflation situation is manageable for now, especially with a population that has become accustomed to regular price rises, however painful.The central bank will of course talk cautiously about inflation, said Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE).But the development of a serious inflation spiral would require greater fiscal pressure, uncontrolled rouble depreciation and the central bank being behind the curve, she added.“They are nowhere near that, they are just not feeling the pressure,” Ribakova said.Authorities responded with rate hikes and capital controls to the rouble’s tumble past 100 to the dollar this year and sharp volatility is always a risk. It traded at 92.76 on Thursday.While a relatively weak rouble is factored into Russia’s budget plans and boosts state coffers through foreign currency export revenues, it pushes up import costs, fans inflation and risks capital flight.OIL PRICE COMFORTOil prices, the lifeblood of Russia’s economy, are currently well above what Russia needs for fiscal security, even if they slid to five-month lows this week.A series of output cuts by OPEC+ countries and the widespread circumvention of the West’s price cap are combining to boost Russia’s energy revenues.“Fundamentally, the price cap’s leverage is increasingly under threat,” KSE Institute said in its November review, referring to the West’s $60 a barrel cap. “In October, more than 99% of seaborne exports of Russian crude oil appear to have been sold above $60/barrel.”The West’s sanctions, designed to cut Moscow’s key source of financing, put immense strain on Russia’s budget deficit early this year, but Moscow now expects a deficit of around just 1% of GDP.“If the oil price stays at the current level, it is extraordinarily comfortable for Russia,” said Ribakova.($1 = 92.3955 roubles)(Reporting by Reuters in Moscow, Alexander Marrow in London; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)","December 8, 2023 - 13:42"
199,UN adopts pact that aims to save global cooperation,"By Michelle NicholsUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) – The United Nations General Assembly adopted a “Pact for the Future” on Sunday, which U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as a landmark agreement that is a “step-change towards more effective, inclusive, networked multilateralism.”The pact, which also includes an annex on working toward a responsible and sustainable digital future, was adopted without a vote at the start of a two-day Summit of the Future. The agreement came after some nine months of negotiations.“We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink,” Guterres told the summit.WHY IS IT IMPORTANTGuterres long-pushed for the summit and the pact, which covers themes including peace and security, global governance, sustainable development, climate change, digital cooperation, human rights, gender, youth and future generations. It lays out some 56 broad actions that countries pledged to achieve.KEY QUOTES FROM THE PACT FOR THE FUTURE“We recognize that the multilateral system and its institutions, with the United Nations and its Charter at the centre, must be strengthened to keep pace with a changing world. They must be fit for the present and the future – effective and capable, prepared for the future, just, democratic, equitable and representative of today’s world, inclusive, interconnected and financially stable.“Today, we pledge a new beginning in multilateralism. The actions in this Pact aim to ensure that the United Nations and other key multilateral institutions can deliver a better future for people and planet, enabling us to fulfil our existing commitments while rising to new and emerging challenges and opportunities.”CONTEXTGlobal crises have spotlighted the need for U.N. reform and overhauling international financial systems. These challenges include ongoing wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan; lagging climate change mitigation efforts; widespread national debt issues; and concerns over technology advancing without governance.Russia’s Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Vershinin criticized the negotiations and adopting the pact.Russia failed in its bid to include an amendment – backed by North Korea, Syria, Nicaragua, Belarus and Iran – that would have spelled out that “the United Nations and its system shall not intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.”","September 22, 2024 - 19:02"
200,Prince Harry says travel industry must do more for local communities,"LONDON (Reuters) – Britain’s Prince Harry said it was crucial the travel industry did better by the local communities in vacation destinations or there would be no tourism business at all in the future.Speaking at the annual general meeting of Travalyst, an initiative he launched in 2019 with the aim of making the travel industry more sustainable, King Charles’ son said it was crucial to do more for those on whom the industry depended.“Travel and tourism relies on destinations, held together by communities, without which we have nowhere to travel to,” said Harry, who appeared by videolink from his home in California.“Communities are the beating heart of travel, and we must do better by the people who are the custodians of the places we visit.”The Travalyst scheme, an independent non-profit body backed by major tourism industry companies including Google, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Expedia, aims to help travellers to cut their carbon emissions, prevent over-tourism and develop local economies.Like his father, who has spoken out for more than 50 years on issues such as sustainability and climate change, Harry has also been a vocal champion of environmental causes.However, he and his wife Meghan have faced accusations of hypocrisy for taking private jets to attend engagements. The prince has previously said he only did so occasionally or in certain circumstances where he needed to keep his family safe, and that he always offsets his carbon dioxide emissions.Harry founded Travalyst before he and his wife – the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – stepped down from their official royal roles in 2020, and since then they have embarked on a number of projects.This week Meghan launched her new lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard, sending jars of strawberry jam to a small number of selected recipients.Earlier this month, the couple announced they would produce two more Netflix shows that will focus on cooking and a U.S. polo championship.","April 17, 2024 - 21:29"
201,Israeli strike wounds two UN peacekeepers in Lebanon,"By Amina Ismail and Timour AzhariBEIRUT/JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Two U.N. peacekeepers were wounded by an Israeli strike near their watchtower in south Lebanon on Friday, Israel’s military said, while blasts shook the peacekeepers’ main base in the area for the second time in 48 hours as Israeli forces battled Hezbollah.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Western countries condemned the attacks. The UNIFIL force called it a “serious development” and said the security of U.N. personnel and property must be guaranteed.France summoned Israel’s ambassador, and issued a statement with Italy and Spain calling such attacks “unjustifiable”. U.S. President Joe Biden said he was asking Israel not to hit the UNIFIL forces. Russia said it was “outraged” and demanded Israel refrain from “hostile actions” against peacekeepers.In Gaza, medics told Reuters at least 13 Palestinians were killed late on Friday by Israeli strikes on a home in Jabalia, where Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) says thousands of people are trapped a week after Israel launched an offensive there to stop Hamas militants from regrouping.The Israeli military said air raid sirens sounded in central Israel and two drones were detected from Lebanon late on Friday. It said it successfully intercepted one drone but one building in Herzliya sustained some damage. No casualties were reported.The Israeli military said two peacekeepers had been hurt by Israeli fire as it was engaging Hezbollah and expressed “deep concern.” It said they had been warned hours earlier to take shelter. The United Nations said both were from Sri Lanka.A Hezbollah statement late on Friday said the Israeli military had failed in its attempts to advance into southern Lebanon and was facing significant resistance that had resulted in heavy Israeli losses.It said the Israeli army was using settler homes in several northern Israeli towns as gathering points and that Hezbollah considered them targets. It warned settlers against remaining there.The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants erupted one year ago when the Iranian-backed group began launching rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas, at the start of the Gaza war.It has intensified in recent weeks, with Israel bombing southern Lebanon, Beirut’s southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley, killing many of Hezbollah’s top leaders, and sending ground troops across the border. Hezbollah for its part has fired rockets deeper into Israel.An Israeli strike overnight in the heart of Beirut killed 22 people and wounded 139, caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati said. Lebanon’s army said two soldiers were killed and three wounded when Israeli forces attacked a military post in Kafra in the south.The Middle East remains on high alert for further escalation, awaiting Israel’s response to an Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1.In a sign of a spreading conflict, a Syrian security source said that the U.S.-led coalition in Syria had targeted Iran-linked sites near northeastern Syria’s Deir el-Zor airport on Friday night.Israel says its campaign in Lebanon aims to make northern Israel safe for tens of thousands of people forced to leave over the last year by Hezbollah rocket fire.Its expanded operation has displaced more than 1.2 million people, according Lebanon’s government, which says more than 2,100 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded in over a year of fighting. The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but includes scores of women and children.Hezbollah rockets have killed at least 54 people in Israel, more than half civilians, according to Israeli authorities.ISRAEL SEEKS SAFE RETURN OF RESIDENTSThe Israeli military’s chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said on Friday Israel it would not stop its campaign “until we ensure that we can safely return the residents not just now, but with a future outlook”.The head of Hezbollah’s media office, Mohammad Afif said the group’s priority is defeating Israel militarily but it is open to diplomatic efforts to stop “the aggression”.The watchtower that came under Israeli fire is at UNIFIL’s main base in Naqoura. UNIFIL said an Israeli bulldozer had also knocked over barriers at U.N. positions near the Blue Line denoting the frontier between Lebanon and Israel, while tanks had moved into the vicinity.UNIFIL has more than 10,000 personnel, with Italy, France, Malaysia, Indonesia and India among the biggest contributors.The chief of staff of Ireland’s Defence Forces, which has around 340 personnel serving in UNIFIL, said Friday’s attack on the observation tower was deliberate.“An observer tower with a round from a tank directly into it, which is a very small target, has to be very deliberate, and it’s a direct fire. So from a military perspective, this is not an accidental act. It’s a direct act,” Lieutenant General Sean Clancy told RTE television.Two Indonesian U.N. peacekeepers were hurt on Thursday after falling from a watchtower following Israeli tank fire, after which Israel said its troops had opened fire nearby, and that Hezbollah fighters operated from areas near UNIFIL posts.FAMILY OF EIGHT KILLED BY ISRAELI STRIKESecurity sources said the target of Thursday night’s airstrike in Beirut was senior Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa, who survived. A Hezbollah lawmaker said no senior Hezbollah officials had been present.At a Beirut hospital that received dozens of wounded, a man sat in a chair in a corridor, his knees wrapped in white bandages, and his face and body covered with wounds.The dead included a family of eight who had evacuated from the south, three of them children, a security source said.“The situation … I don’t even know how to describe it,” said Wael al-Jaroush, head of the Makassed hospital’s medical department. “We received three martyrs … in pieces.”In northern Israel, a Thai worker was killed as a result of fallen munition, likely fired from Lebanon, Israel’s military said. It also said the Israeli airforce had killed a Hezbollah commander with anti-tank missiles in northern Israel’s Ramot Naftali. Hezbollah issued no immediate comment on that claim.In Iran, the Revolutionary Guards said the body of its deputy commander Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan – killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut on Sept. 27 along with Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah – had been found. A Guards statement said Nilforoushan’s body would be moved to Iran for burial.(Additional reporting by Laila Bassam, Amina Ismail, Timour Azhari, Tom Perry and Abdelhadi Ramahi in Beirut, Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem, Orhan Qereman in Qamishli, Clauda Tanios, Tala Ramadan and Ahmed Elimam in Dubai and Krishn Kaushi in New Delhi; Writing by Tom Perry, Lincoln Feast, Sharon Singleton, Frances Kerry, Daniel Wallis and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Kevin Liffey, Ros Russell and Deepa Babington)","October 11, 2024 - 23:40"
202,"Pound, UK stocks get a lift from BoE ‘sugar rush’","By Yoruk Bahceli and Amanda CooperLONDON (Reuters) -Sterling rallied sharply on Thursday, solidifying its position as the best performing major currency of 2024, while UK-focussed stocks rose after the Bank of England cut rates but indicated future cuts may be more gradual than many had thought.The BoE, which delivered its second rate cut since 2020, said that after Labour Party finance minister Rachel Reeves’ high-tax, high-spend budget last week, it expected higher inflation and growth.London-listed shares of mid-sized companies touched session highs, while UK government bonds headed for their best one-day performance in almost a month, reflecting investor demand for sterling-denominated assets.Sterling rose by as much as 0.78% to $1.298 after the decision, while two-year gilt yields fell 6 basis points to 4.448%, as bond prices rose.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 8-1 to cut rates to 4.75% from 5%, a stronger majority than expectations in a Reuters poll for a 7-2 vote in favour of a cut.The BoE predicted last week’s budget, which contained big increases in tax, spending and borrowing – would boost the size of Britain’s economy by around 0.75% next year but barely improve annual growth rates in two or three years’ time.It said the budget was likely to add just under half a percentage point to the rate of inflation at its peak in just over two years’ time, causing inflation to take a year longer to return sustainably to its 2% target.Right now, money markets show traders believe UK rates could fall by just over half a percent next year – something economists and analysts believe is too tame, given the BoE’s predictions predate the rise in gilt yields and the shift in market borrowing rates following the budget.“Remember, markets are pricing fewer than three rate cuts from here on in,” James Smith, developed markets economist – UK, at ING said.“We don’t think that sounds particularly realistic. Our view is that rate cuts will be cut at every meeting from February until rates reach 3.25% next autumn.”British inflation has proven far more stubborn than that in other developed nations, particularly where wages and the services sector are concerned.Governor Andrew Bailey said the BoE now saw inflation returning to target by mid-2027, from a previous estimate of mid-2026.“That information was made less useful because it probably wouldn’t look quite like that if they took into account the market’s repricing in the wake of the budget,” Rabobank senior rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor said.UK rates remaining higher for longer and then falling more slowly than elsewhere has been a key driver for sterling.The pound is the best-performing major currency against the dollar this year, up 2% with Thursday’s rally.Sterling could lose that sheen, especially if markets adjust to the view that British rates could fall faster, analysts said.“I think that will become clear as peers, such as the U.S., begin to outpace the UK to a more significant degree, although the near-term sugar rush from the Budget might mask that for a short while,” Pepperstone senior research strategist Michael Brown said.(Additional reporting by Samuel Indyk; Editing by Alun John, Dhara Ranasinghe and Ros Russell)","November 7, 2024 - 16:22"
203,Swiss youth seek ways out of mental health crisis,"If there had been a council of the future in his young days, it would not have concerned itself with mental health. This is the comment of the grey-haired expert to whom young people between 16 and 24 ask their questions. But one can see from the faces of the participants that they are fully aware of the responsibility they are taking on here.Annabel Lewis from Geneva voted for the mental health focus. “I knew that mental illness affects young people – but the figures we are seeing are thought-provoking,” she says.  One out of five people is affected by mental illness. That means every Swiss young person likely has a peer who is struggling psychologically.The Under-24 Council of the Future is meeting this autumn for one weekend each in Zurich, Lausanne and Locarno. They hear information briefings, they discuss, and at the end they formulate their suggestions to the political level as to how Switzerland can better deal with the issue of mental health.The Council of the Future is a citizen assembly or panel. This is nothing new either in Switzerland or elsewhere in the world. In recent years such groups have emerged as a trend in the development of democracy.The trend began in Europe with the Irish citizen assembly We The Citizens. The Irish citizens chosen by lot were to come up with positions on polarising issues through a discussion process, called deliberation. Surprising for many, one of the recommendations of this Irish panel was for a liberal abortion law – and in 2018, in the traditionally Catholic country, almost two thirds voted in favour. Up till then in Ireland there had been no movement on the issue of abortion for a long time.After the Irish citizen assembly had thus got the country out of one political cul-de-sac, there emerged further such panels chosen by lot, including national climate change councils in France, Germany, and Britain.Councils of citizens often find themselves dealing with climate change issues. NGOs and activists like Extinction Rebellion have been calling for these councils to be involved in decision-making on climate change policy. The three citizen councils most recently organised in Switzerland – in the municipalities of Winterthur, Uster and Thalwil – dealt with sustainability and climate policy.On the other hand, the Council of the Future, whose members belong to the same generation as Greta Thunberg, has taken up a different topic which was not a major political issue until now: mental health.This was decided by a representative survey of 20,000 young adults around Switzerland. Over 40% voted to focus on mental health. In second place, with 20%, came sustainability.Seventeen year-old Lewis from Geneva voted for the mental health focus. The Council of the Future member does not see herself really as a political person.  She saw the call to join the Council of the Future as an opportunity to get to know Swiss politics more deeply.  Lewis has not made up her mind and is open to considering all suggestions that come up. She feels that mental health as a topic should get more exposure in the school system.“In school, mental health has not been an issue so far, which is why people of all ages find it hard to talk about,” says Lewis. “Yet mental health should not be a taboo topic and I would favour it being more talked about in the school environment. Those affected would then be freed of stigma and be more likely to seek out therapy resources.”Lewis believes that Switzerland should spend more money on this – increasing therapy resources and making the topic a more open one. She is Swiss but also a British citizen. Her Geneva world is very international – but in the Council of the Future she encounters very different social worlds.In terms of education and social milieu, the gathering does reflect the range of Swiss society. A carpenter from Emmental is a member of the Council of the Future. “I never would have met him otherwise”, reflects 18-year-old Wesley Meldau from Zürich.Meldau sees his involvement in the Council of the Future as an opportunity to information, hearing different views – and then coming up with suggestions. “I hope we can make practical proposals to the politicians, and that the politicians will hear us,” he says.“I hope and believe that the new parliament will take the work of the Council of the Future seriously”, says co-project-leader Che Wagner. “I am happy the young people voted for mental health, because the issue belongs neither to left nor right, and people have not already made up their minds.”There are already quite a few youth parliaments in operation, and every year in November there is a federal youth session, where young people go to the federal parliament house for four days and work on developing positions for youth on political issues.So is a project like the Council of the Future needed? “We are reaching young people who would not be politically involved otherwise by means of this Council of the Future”, says co-project-leader Lara Oliveira König. “The choosing by lot is what makes the difference, for that way we have reached young people who don’t feel the urge to take part in youth parliaments or sessions.”Both of the co-project-leaders are clear that the younger generation in Switzerland is not really much a part of politics here. Only 23% of the 800,000 16- to 24-year-olds and 37% of adult Swiss citizens under 24 have so far participated in Swiss democracy.The Under-24 Council of the Future project enjoys widespread support in political and government circles. Yet many – as appeared in the welcoming speeches on opening day – regard it as a tool of civic education and participation, rather than a democratic innovation in its own right.At any rate, the participants want their ideas to be heard. So the important question is – as with all such citizen groups – what will happen with the proposals that come out of the Council of the Future.One negative example was provided by the Citizen Convention on Climate in France. At the outset, President Emmanuel Macron promised to bring all proposals from the group “unfiltered” to be voted on in parliament or by the people at large. He then torpedoed some ideas he personally didn’t like. Finally parliament passed a climate change law that the Citizen Convention on Climate strongly disagreed with.So there is one citizen assembly which found that, in end, it wasn’t listened to. Will it be different in Switzerland?Edited by Mark Livingston. Translated from German by Terence MacNamee/ds","November 24, 2023 - 08:20"
204,Africa wants more time and money to comply with EU deforestation regulation ,"Consumers in the European Union account for about 10% of global deforestation. The 27-member bloc’s first attempt at tackling the problem was the introduction of the EU Timber Legislation (EUTR) in 2013. The legislation prohibited the sale of illegally harvested wood on the EU market. A little over ten years later, the EU plans to implement a new legislation known as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) that will replace the EUTR. Besides timber, the EUDR also targets other commodities responsible for deforestation worldwide such as cocoa, coffee, beef, palm oil, rubber and soy. The regulation is slated to come into force on December 30, 2024.  Companies wishing to sell these commodities and related products in the EU will have to prove that these products are not linked to deforestation or forest degradation. Swiss companies such as Nestlé, Barry Callebaut and Lindt & Sprüngli have pledged to have deforestation-free supply chains by 2025 and have developed their own cocoa traceability systems to achieve their commitments. For example, Lindt & Sprüngli invested CHF27.5 million ($31.8 million) in 2022 into sourcing sustainable cocoa. This has put Switzerland in a decent position to comply with EUDR norms: the share of Swiss imports of sustainable cocoa has gone up from 50% in 2017 to 82% in 2023.  But it is not just companies that stand to lose out if they cannot prove they’ve done their due diligence. Countries which export these commodities could also see a drop in revenue if they are excluded from the European market. According to a Rabobank analysis, complying with EUDR can cost between 0.29% to 4.3% of the value of imports into the EU. Africa and South America have the most to lose. For example, a recent report by thinktank ODI

estimates that the EUDR will cost coffee exporter Ethiopia (coffee accounts for 30-35% total export earnings) an 18.4% drop in exports and a 0.6% loss in GDP. To avoid a significant drop in their revenues, African nations are in a mad race to register their farmers (incorporate their photo, national ID, farm boundary and coffee production history) onto a national database to ensure that those who clear forests can be excluded from supply chains. This includes the laborious process of mapping individual farm boundaries to guarantee traceability of commodities such as coffee back to individual farms. This will allow any expansion of farm boundaries into forest areas to be identified.  “Registering farmers is not difficult, but it is not easy either,” says Kajiru Francis Kissenge, director of coffee development at the Tanzania Coffee Board.  Tanzania (half its coffee exports are to the EU) started preparing for the EUDR in September. It expects to finish registering coffee farmers by January 2025, a little after the current deadline.  “Most of the farmers are in cooperatives. The challenge is getting precise GPS locations of their farms. Farms are close to each other and we have to find precise mapping technology that ensures there is no overlap in farm boundaries,” Kissenge says. According to him, to save money, the Tanzania Coffee Board first started the farm-mapping process using free digital tools, but they were not accurate enough and showed an overlap of farm boundaries. They are now in the process of sourcing more precise technology that needs to be budgeted for. “We estimate that it will cost $1.50-$2 (CHF1.30-CHF1.75) per farm to map the farm boundaries and there are about 340,000 coffee farmers in Tanzania,” Kissenge says. “It would be nice to get funding from the EU because good technology is not cheap.” The EU recently announced a substantial financial payment

of TZS97 billion (CHF30 million) to Tanzania for sectoral reforms, but preparing its coffee sector for EUDR compliance is not on the list. West African cocoa heavyweight Ghana has been putting together a cocoa traceability system since 2021. The database, labelled the Cocoa Management System (CMS), will not just contain the details of Ghana’s 1.5 million cocoa farmers but also be used to pay them for their cocoa beans and deliver a pension scheme.  The CMS will also help Ghana comply with the new EU regulation on deforestation, an important goal given that 62% of the country’s cocoa output was exported to the EU in 2022. One of the major components of the CMS developed for EUDR purpose is the Ghana Cocoa Traceability System (GCTS) and cocoa-related deforestation risks assessment model that are meant to link data on forest cover with cocoa cultivation. “The development and operationalisation of these systems cost us over €50 million (CHF46.8 million),” says Michael Ekow Amoah, deputy director of research and development at the Ghana cocoa board (COCOBOD). “It’s a worthwhile investment but not fair. The EU should have contributed to the initial investment.” In 2019 Ghana invested in cocoa traceability by using funds from a $600 million loan signed in 2019 to finance cocoa productivity enhancement measures with a loan syndicate that includes the African Development Bank, as well as private investment banks including Credit Suisse (now part of UBS). The EU signed a €15 million agreement last October

with Ghana for a green transition and agribusiness programme which will focus on sustainable, climate-resilient agricultural production that could be used for EUDR compliance. Ghana is now well ahead of other African countries to comply with EU demands. According to a presentation at a technical workshop on the EUDR held in Accra on May 30, Ghana’s cocoa board has mapped a little over 1.2 million hectares of cocoa farms already out of a total of 1.3 million and registered close to 793,000 cocoa farmers out of 1.5 million.  “It’s worthwhile in the sense that it will enable Ghana to provide the relevant evidence to meet the EUDR requirements and increase our market share of the EU market,” says Amoah. Ghana and Tanzania are feeling the pain of complying with the EUDR right now, but registering farmers and mapping farms will have benefits that go beyond tackling deforestation. “To implement climate-smart agriculture, tackle child labour or improve agricultural practices, you need data. Currently, the focus is on preventing deforestation, but the fact is you need transparency to modernise the sector,” says Christian Robin, CEO of the Swiss Platform for Sustainable Cocoa (SWISSCO). Switzerland is offering some financial support through the Green Commodities Programme developed in collaboration with the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2015. The programme originally focused on sustainable production of agricultural commodities in Peru (cocoa and coffee) and Indonesia (palm oil). The third phase (2023-2026) has set aside CHF11 million (CHF5 million from SECO) for five projects relevant to the EUDR: cocoa in Ghana, livestock and soy in Brazil’s Tocantins state, palm oil in Indonesia and in Malaysia’s Sabah state, and coffee and cocoa in Peru. In a surprise move, the European Commission announced on October 1 a proposal to delay the implementation of the deforestation regulation by one year, i.e. December 30, 2025, instead of December 30, 2024. The proposal will have to be approved by the European parliament with the vote most likely to take place in November or December. Countries and trading associations affected by the EUDR had been asking for more time to prepare. In September, cocoa-producing countries signed a joint declaration in Ivory Coast’s largest city Abidjan (headquarters of the International Cocoa Organization ICCO) asking for a two-year delay in the implementation of the EUDR. A few weeks earlier the European Cocoa Association had written to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, also asking for a postponement. “It’s OK if they ask for more time and money from the EU. It’s also good to be pragmatic and flexible,” Robin says. Ghana could use a 12-month extension. Its Cocoa Management System is currently not fully developed with two out of the eight components still not ready for implementation.  “It will enable Ghana to procure all the requisite logistics required to operationalise the national systems put in place to meet the requirements of the EUDR. It will also enable Ghana to perfect the system,” Amoah says.  The delay would also provide a cushion for Tanzania’s coffee board. Registration of coffee farmers has only just started in the Kagare region that accounts for 30-40% of all coffee output. It will then be rolled across the remaining 16 coffee-growing regions of the country. This is expected to take at least until January 2025 to complete.  “The postponement will be a big relief,” Kissenge says. “It will allow us more time to prepare and source the right mapping technology instead of rushing.” Edited by Virginie Mangin/ts","October 31, 2024 - 09:00"

But Ahmad Allahgholi from Basel and his team work here to save the coral reef. He gave up his job as a banker to save coral reefs from dying out on the coast of the Maldives. With his non-profit organisation “Coralive”, Allahgholi now runs one of the largest underwater reforestation projects in the world.Almost half of all the inhabitants of Ivory Coast live below the poverty line. Many live in slums without access to running water or sanitation.It is here where Lotti Latrous works to give many local people a new perspective: 24 years ago she built an outpatient clinic, a hospital for the dying and an orphanage in Grand Bassam, is a town in south-eastern region of the Ivory Coast. She was crowned the “Swiss Woman of the Year 2004” and today she receives up to 250 people daily who are seeking help in one of the centres she and her husband have built. In these centres, she accompanies the terminally ill with dignity until their death.It all started with a refrigerator full of bacteria: Simon Ittig received this unusual gift from his doctoral supervisor when his professor retired. He came up with the idea of developing a new cancer therapy using these bacteria by chance.These bacteria, which are usually found in spoiled pork, cause diarrhoea. With his start-up T3 Pharma, Simon Ittig is working towards modify these bacteria so they grow specifically in tumours and fight them. The treatment is still in the test phase and the start-up founder is hesitantly optimistic. But he says, “We are on a good path.”Moritz Schiller and his friends have a very specific vision: they want to develop a sustainable material that replaces plastic packaging and plastic insulation materials.The solution? A raw material made from mushrooms. This new packaging material is ecologically degradable and the resources it requires to make it grow back quickly. The three friends are still working on automated processes which would make the sustainable Styrofoam substitute cheaper and suitable for mass production.Currently, hundreds of kilometres of minefields stretch across Ukraine. These minefields pose a major problem for the civilian population. Affected areas are no longer accessible or inhabitable and also affect agriculture production.The Swiss Foundation for Demining (FDS) has taken on the task of demining the affected regions. The foundation also trains people who know the regions in demining.Paediatrician Beat Richner, who died in 2018, left behind an incredible life’s work: The Zurich native built five children’s hospitals in Cambodia after the Kantha Bopha hospital was destroyed under the Khmer Rouge rule.On the fifth anniversary of Richner’s death, how much of “Swissness” is still in his hospitals today? More than 80% of hospital admissions of children and the youth take place in the facilities of the Kantha Bopa Children’s Hospital Foundation. Although the influence from Switzerland is diminishing, an important transfer of knowledge between Swiss paediatricians and the hospitals in Cambodia remains to this day.","September 26, 2023 - 11:00"
206,China’s Xi urges US to ‘get along’ as he congratulates Trump,"By Liz Lee, Farah Master and Ryan WooBEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) -China’s President Xi Jinping congratulated Donald Trump on his U.S. presidential win and urged both nations to find the “right way to get along”, as looming U.S. tariffs threatened to return them to the days of a trade war years ago.Stable, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relations serve the interests of both, Xi said on Thursday, adding that the international community would expect the two powers to “respect each other (and) co-exist peacefully”.Xi also called for strengthened dialogue to properly manage differences.Ties hit a new low after clashes over issues ranging from trade and security to the future of Taiwan and the South China Sea, only starting to improve in November 2023 after Xi and President Joe Biden met for four hours in California.Trump’s win could revive issues from his first presidency, when he started the bruising trade war with the world’s second-largest economy in 2018, though striking a truce just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in January 2020.The Republican, who has vowed to adopt stiff tariffs, recaptured the White House with a sweeping victory over Democrat Kamala Harris in Tuesday’s election, and will take office in January.Echoing Xi’s call for stability, the commerce ministry said China was willing to jointly develop healthy economic and trade ties the United States.China is willing to expand co-operation to benefit both countries, a ministry spokesperson said, when asked at a regular press conference about the prospect of more U.S. tariffs, setting aside for now any suggestion of potential retaliation.Xi’s congratulatory message to Trump was more subdued than when the latter first won election in November 2016.At the time, Xi called for “greater progress in China-U.S. relations from a new starting point”, saying both economies should shoulder responsibilities in areas such as world peace and stability, global development and prosperity.Still, in an editorial on Wednesday, the state-run China Daily portrayed Trump’s second presidency as a potential “new beginning in China-U.S. relations, if the chance that has been offered is not wasted”.U.S. policies and misconceptions towards China had posed challenges for ties, it said.“A pragmatic approach to bilateral relations is essential in navigating the complexities of global challenges,” it added.The Biden administration did not dismantle Trump’s trade policies and continued to target China’s state-driven industrial practices.In September, it locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, such as duties of 100% on electric vehicles, 50% on solar cells and 25% on steel, aluminium, EV batteries and key minerals, in a bid to protect strategic American industries.But Trump’s threat of tariffs of 60% on U.S. imports of Chinese goods poses major growth risks for China.They would be much higher than the 7.5% to 25% levied in his first term, and come at a much more vulnerable time for the Chinese economy, as it battles a steep property downturn, the burden of local government debt and weak domestic demand.(Reporting by Farah Master in Hong Kong; Liz Lee, Ryan Woo, Joe Cash and the Beijing newsroom; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Clarence Fernandez)","November 7, 2024 - 09:02"
207,How the meat lobby tries to influence climate policy in Switzerland,"At first glance, only two parliamentarians are directly linked to the industry’s two main umbrella organisations: Proviande, which represents major producers and distributors like Migros and Coop, and the Union Professionnelle Suisse de la Viande (Swiss Meat Trade Association), the political arm of the meat industry.However, an investigation by Swiss public television, RTS, uncovered far more extensive connections. Based on publicly available data, a well-established network was revealed, linking 27 agricultural organisations and businesses, particularly those involved in meat production, with 16 members of parliament. Additionally, there are indirect ties to two other parliamentarians.“The meat industry is well represented in Bern,” says Mike Egger, a Swiss People’s Party parliamentarian from canton St Gallen, who is part of this network and also project manager at Micarna (Migros). “I don’t understand the demonisation of meat. It’s a very healthy food containing important nutrients. In Switzerland, agriculture, especially livestock farming, does an excellent job in terms of sustainability,” he argues.The meat sector generates CHF10 billion ($12 billion) annually and provides employment for thousands. Egger is unhappy with the federal government’s new climate strategy, published in September 2023, which seeks to reduce meat production and encourages farmers to grow more plant proteins through direct payments.“We’ll be reviewing and debating this strategy,” says Egger. “I’m confident it won’t have a big impact because, ultimately, we want productive agriculture. That’s what I’m determined to defend.”The meat lobby has developed a hard-hitting communication strategy to play down the role of livestock farming in climate change and challenge the conclusions of international experts.One example is a sponsored article in the Le Matin Dimanche newspaper, which stated that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) “recently concluded that the current algorithm for calculating greenhouse gas emissions significantly overestimates global temperature trends”.Valentine Python, a climatologist and former Green Party parliamentarian, describes this as disinformation. “They’re presenting completely erroneous and misleading facts,” she says.“Not only is the IPCC being misquoted, but they are also being made to say the exact opposite of what they’ve claimed. This is scientific denial,” she adds.The Swiss Farmers’ Union (USP) released a video featuring American air quality expert Frank Mitloehner, aiming to downplay the role of livestock farming in global warming. However, Mitloehner is closely tied to the powerful American meat industry.“Over $5 million (CHF4.2 million) has been invested by the meat industry in the Clear Center research facility created for him at the University of California,” notes Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental policy at the University of Miami. “What’s interesting is that he has no formal climate training, yet he talks about Earth’s cycles, emissions, and methane as though he’s a greenhouse gas expert. His aim is to defend the meat and dairy industries.”So why does the USP feature this controversial expert? Michel Darbellay, a member of the USP executive, says: “I can’t comment on the funding of this professor or other issues. What I can say is that livestock farming and meat consumption are often unfairly stigmatised. We need to rely on scientific foundations to take responsibility.”In Switzerland, Mitloehner’s colleague Peer Ederer, an agri-food consultant, questions the impact of livestock farming on global warming. Ederer co-authored the Dublin Declaration, an international appeal launched in 2022 to defend animal farming. “A minority of scientists have imposed their anti-meat positions,” Ederer claims.“The majority of scientists don’t agree with them. The Dublin Declaration has given them a platform to express their views. In major political capitals, including Brussels, Berlin, and Washington, the ministries are aware of the declaration, which is a success.”However, Camille Perrin, an agricultural policy expert at the European consumer organisation BEUC, argues that the Dublin Declaration “creates doubt about the consensus on the impacts of meat consumption and provides ammunition for politicians opposing ambitious environmental strategies”.In Switzerland, it seems likely that the federal government’s climate strategy may face similar challenges in Parliament.Translated from French with DeepL/amva","September 18, 2024 - 11:00"
208,COP28 lines up new climate pledges – but do they work?,"By Kate AbnettDUBAI (Reuters) – While the world’s climate diplomats huddle over draft decisions to be made at the end of this year’s U.N. climate summit, governments at COP28 are firing off a flurry of new promises for action.Among the expected pledges at COP28 are a goal to triple renewable energy capacity and initiatives on methane and coal power. These voluntary side deals have proliferated in recent years, even as global temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.Unlike official summit decisions, which must be passed by consensus among the nearly 200 countries, voluntary pledges can be made quickly, and boldly, without the worry of one party objecting.“They go much further than what you can do multilaterally,” said Marc Vanheukelen, a former EU official who led the bloc’s work on an international methane emissions pledge launched at the COP26 climate summit in 2021.Analysis of some of the COP pledges backed by substantial groups of countries or funders suggests they did lead to stronger action to curb climate change. Others have struggled – with experts warning that if unfulfilled, COP side deals risk undermining trust in the core U.N. climate negotiations.“Often, these are exercises in what you could call ‘fire and forget’,” said Vanheukelen. Countries will fire off a statement of support, but then “you don’t watch anymore what is happening to it”.Here is how some of the biggest voluntary pledges from recent years are faring today:GLOBAL METHANE PLEDGEAmong the side deals announced at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, the U.S. and EU led more than 100 countries in committing to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030.Methane is responsible for around 30% of human-caused global warming since the industrial revolution. A potent greenhouse gas, it leaches into the atmosphere from leaky oil and gas infrastructure, livestock burps and manure, and landfill sites.Supporters credit the Global Methane Pledge with raising the profile of the potent greenhouse gas, which governments including the EU, Nigeria and Canada have since introduced or strengthened regulation of.The U.S. and China have also made methane a topic of shared efforts, although China and other major emitters including Russia have not backed the pledge.Groups tracking the pledge say it’s too early to gauge success by emissions levels, as policies passed since 2021 would take a few years to kick in. Methane emissions from the oil and gas industry increased slightly last year alongside rising fuel production.“It’s now about the actions that are being teed up. It’s about the finance systems that are being created,” said Jonathan Banks, Global Director on Methane at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force, pointing to funding announcements expected at COP28.Reuters previously reported the World Bank is expected during the summit to new launch a fund, with backing from oil companies among others, to finance methane leak detection and cleanup programs in developing countries.FOSSIL FUEL FINANCEMore than 30 governments including the U.S. and Canada committed at COP26 to stop financing international fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022 – the first international political deal to halt overseas oil and gas finance.By end-2022, Canada, Britain, France and others had national policies in place to meet this goal, according to campaign group Oil Change International (OCI), estimating that the moves altogether have shifted some $5.7 billion away from fossil fuel projects toward clean energy.“This initiative has done relatively well and has demonstrated real world progress,” said OCI campaign manager Laurie van der Burg. “For many countries, they only started working on this after they joined the pledge.”Still, some countries blew past the deadline and continue to fund fossil fuels overseas, including the United States, Italy and Germany. The three altogether have put more than $4 billion into fossil fuels overseas since 2022, amid the Western drive to replace Russian gas, OCI said.HALTING DEFORESTATIONMore than 140 governments – representing the vast majority of the world’s forests – pledged at COP26 to end deforestation by 2030, underpinned by $19 billion in funding commitments.The year after, in 2022, deforestation increased by 4% worldwide, according to a coalition of environmental organizations including WWF, The Rainforest Alliance and Climate Focus.“It’s definitely not showing signs right now that it will succeed,” said Erin Matson of Climate Focus, which advises governments and companies on emissions-cutting policies.While Brazil has slashed deforestation in 2023, that trend came only after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office this year.“The problem with these voluntary declarations is you don’t nail out the nitty gritty in order to really get people to abide by it,” Matson said, referring to details such as how progress might be measured.___For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here.(Reporting by Kate Abnett; additional reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Katy Daigle and Jon Boyle)","December 2, 2023 - 04:05"
209,Far right wins first round in France election,"AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) -Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) party won the first round of France’s parliamentary elections on Sunday, exit polls showed, but the final result will depend on days of horsetrading before next week’s run-off.The euro gained around 0.23% to trade around $1.0736 in early Asia-Pacific trading.European markets have been rattled since President Emmanuel Macron’s shock decision on June 9 to call a snap election.The prospect of a far-right, or leftwing win has unsettled investors, as both have pledged big spending increases, which could undermine France’s already fragile finances.COMMENTS:PETER GOVES, HEAD OF DEVELOPED MARKET DEBT SOVERIGN RESEARCH, MFS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LONDON:“A hung parliament would appear to remain the base case, loosely in line with market expectations. That said, uncertainties are high and the NR looks like it will be the largest party in the new Assembly.“We would caution about drawing too firm an inference about the exact seat projection, because the high turn out has seen an eruption of three-way contests. This complicates matters.“How leaders respond and how alliances bear out will be significant for the end result. A hung parliament is far from politically ideal, but is not necessarily the most unfriendly market outcome.“As such, OAT-Bunds may take some comfort, but we struggle to see a material and sustainable snap back.”FIONA CINCOTTA, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYST, CITY INDEX, LONDON:“I think it’s a slight ‘well, there was no surprises’, so there was a sense of relief there. Le Pen had a slightly smaller margin than some of the polls had pointed to, which may have helped the euro a little bit higher on the open.”“Attention now is on July 7 to see whether the second round supports an absolute majority or not. So it does feel like we’re a little bit in limbo, but relief that it wasn’t worse.”DAVID MORRISON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, TRADE NATION, LONDON:“One of the things you think about is this is going to be a big protest against Macron and a big positive for RN.”“But, of course, it is going to take a little bit longer to really find out what that vote percentage of theirs is, because the polls really were very positive and getting higher and higher and Macron was getting around the 20% level and that was feeding into a lot of concern about France, Europe and the euro and a possible French version of Truss.”“We’re not going to know any more before next Sunday. How is it going to go, if those three-way polls go to two, because there is a party that stands down to push back against RN, what is that going to mean? That is all open at the moment. What we’re going to be looking at is a bit of uncertainty across all European indices and the euro going into next week.”MICHAEL BROWN, SENIOR STRATEGIST, PEPPERSTONE, LONDON:“Perhaps the result isn’t as bad as the market had feared. The exit polls… had Le Pen’s party winning between 240 to 310 seats, so the midpoint of that is just shy of a majority.”“We’ve also seen a lot of rhetoric form other parties looking to perhaps pull out candidates to try and avoid the National Rally winning seats in the runoff next Sunday.”“The market may be taking a little bit of solace in that. But overall, the downside risks that were there on Friday at the close remain.”“The two most likely scenarios are either a majority for the RN, although the probability for that has decreased slightly… or we end up with a hung parliament and a stalemante situation which then goes into weeks if not months of neogitations to try and form a government.”“It’s very much a case of wait and see where the actual results of the first round election do end up, because there are some pretty wide spreads in terms of the seat projections that have been extrapolated from the vote shares.”“Volatility in the euro and French assets in particular will remain relatively high over the next few days and into next Sunday.”PHILIP SHAW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INVESTEC, LONDON:“The overall results aren’t far away from most of the polls but obviously because of the electoral system, we really don’t have a very clear idea of what the seat distribution is going to be like.”“It’s all in the balance. We may know a little bit more when we get the counts from the first round to see how many deputies have been elected in the first round and what the second-round fights are likely to be. So that might shed a little more light on the situation. But clearly, there are a number of question marks which will remain even after the result are in.”“Much would – because we don’t know if they’ll get a majority yet – depend on how the process of cohabitation is between a potential National Rally government and Macron himself. The question still very much there.”CARSTEN BRZESKI, GLOBAL HEAD OF MACRO, ING, FRANKFURT:“With this result, markets are looking into another week of really high uncertainty. Probably fear, as it is still possible for RN to gain an absolute majority next week.”“This is confirming what markets see as the most disruptive scenario.”“I would expect another widening of the (French-German bond) spread starting tomorrow and we might even see some minor drop in the CAC 40.”“We will have a lot coming up in the next days in terms of new polls showing what this could mean for the individual seats.”“From the markets point of view, a win by the leftwing bloc would have been an even worse scenario, even though from the start it was very unlikely.”(Compiled by Yoruk Bahceli and Amanda Cooper)","June 30, 2024 - 22:45"
210,Stocks Rise as CPI ‘Checks The Box’ for Fed Cuts: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Stocks rose after an in-line US inflation report did little to alter bets the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September.The S&P 500 extended its advance into a fifth straight day, the longest winning streak in more than month. Most of its major groups gained, with financial, energy and tech shares leading the charge. In late trading, Cisco Systems Inc. climbed on a solid revenue forecast. Treasuries saw small moves. The dollar remained at a four-month low.The consumer price index reinforced the trend of disinflation and brought a degree of relief to markets still reeling after last week’s meltdown. Combined with a softening job market, the Fed is widely expected to start lowering rates next month, while the size of the cut will likely be determined by incoming data.“It may not have been as cool as yesterday’s PPI, but today’s as-expected CPI likely will not rock the boat,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Now the primary question is whether the Fed will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points next month. If most of the data over the next five weeks points to a slowing economy, the Fed may cut more aggressively.”At Evercore, Krishna Guha said the CPI was not perfect, but it was good enough as it was consistent with a tame read on the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. In addition, the central bank has disavowed data-point dependence, and is looking at the wider outlook and balance of risks.“This is now a labor data-first Fed, not an inflation data-first Fed, and the incoming labor data will determine how aggressively the Fed pulls forward rate cuts,” Guha noted.Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said he is growing more concerned about the labor market than inflation.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,455. Megacaps were mixed, with Nvidia Corp. up and Alphabet Inc. down. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – the VIX – continued to subside, dropping to around 16. That’s after an unprecedented spike that took the gauge above 65 last week. Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 3.84%. Swap traders are pricing in 32 basis points of Fed easing in September.At Nationwide, Mark Hackett says “calming macro fears” are among the factors providing an improved backdrop for equities. The stress of the market decline is a “fading memory,” he noted.The latest consumer price report checks the box for the Fed to start cutting rates in September, according to TD Securities’ strategists led by Oscar Munoz and Gennadiy Goldberg.“Today’s CPI report is again unambiguously welcome news for the Federal Reserve,” they said. “As risks have become truly two-sided for the US economy, if not slightly tilted toward downward employment outcomes, we expect the Fed’s upcoming decision to come down to the magnitude of the first rate cut.”To Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance, the July CPI print is the ultimate “no news, is good news” because the markets have been on edge and the Fed is looking to cut interest rates — and nothing in this report should deter them from doing so.At Principal Asset Management, Seema Shah says the CPI print removes any lingering inflation obstacles that may have been preventing the Fed from starting the rate cutting cycle in September. Yet, the number also suggests limited urgency for a 50 basis-point cut.“It offers little new information to guide the future decisions of the Fed, aside from potentially supporting a rate cut due to job market concerns,” according to Florian Ielpo at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.“The soft CPI report will likely give Fed officials modestly more confidence that inflation is on the way down,” said Anna Wong and Stuart Paul at Bloomberg Economics. “Even though July’s core PCE inflation print won’t be as good, we expect the Fed to cut rates in September due to the rising unemployment rate.”Traders are still pricing in just over 1 percentage point worth of rate reductions in 2024, with three Fed policy meetings remaining this year. In recent sessions, market pricing had shown a split on the outcome of either 25 or 50 basis points worth of rate reductions next month.“The inflation data has been good enough to allow the Fed to start cutting rates in September, but does not give them a reason to cut aggressively,” said Brian Rose at UBS Global Wealth Management. “The decision whether to cut by 50 basis points instead of the usual 25 basis points may come down to the August labor report.”Rose also notes that Thursday’s retail sales data is another critical release as the main downside risk to his base-case scenario of a soft landing is a pullback in consumer spending.“The US economy is sustainably cooling, and the labor market is exhibiting a bit of slowing,” said Neil Sun, a BlueBay portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management. “However, we are not overly concerned over US recession risks in the short-term. We stand ready to thoughtfully capitalize on any pockets of volatility should underlying trends of cooling inflation and sustainably slowing US economy continue.”Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from John Viljoen, Sujata Rao, Winnie Hsu, Chiranjivi Chakraborty and Rob Verdonck.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","August 14, 2024 - 23:27"
211,Analysis-COP28 crowds: a dangerous distraction or sign of success?,"By Valerie VolcoviciDUBAI (Reuters) – Flashy country pavilions, corporate-sponsored cocktail parties and a smorgasbord of side events have turned the annual U.N. climate summit into what some say is a trade show or circus.In this year’s gleaming host city of Dubai, billboards advertise the benefits of wind energy, climate ambition and Exxon Mobil’s carbon capture projects.And with a record 84,000 registered attendees, this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP28, is a far cry from the first in Berlin in 1995, a low-key affair with fewer than 4,000 delegates focused on multilateral climate change cooperation.This is seen by some as a sign of success and by others as a dangerous distraction from the business of combating climate change as over nearly three decades global oil demand, carbon emissions and temperatures have marched steadily upward.“It’s a lobby fest where polluters can schmooze with politicians, all under the guise of tackling climate change,” Pascoe Sabido, a researcher at the Corporate Europe Observatory, which scrutinizes corporate influence on policy-making, said.The United Nations and COP backers say the planet would be much worse off without them.For Alden Meyer, a senior associate at think tank E3G who has attended every COP, the carnival-like atmosphere is a positive sign of increasing global engagement in the climate crisis, even if it meant long queues for food and coffee.“It’s a three-ring circus, and it is a good thing. It means the issue has reached critical mass,” Meyer said.Lisa Jacobson, president of the 65-member Business Council for Sustainable Energy, which represents the energy efficiency, natural gas and renewable energy industries, agrees.Jacobson recalls that in 2000 in The Hague, the turnout was so low that everyone fitted into one auditorium. Having more than 80,000 people attend is something she only dreamed of.“It’s all we wished for,” she said.PLEDGESCountries have adopted a strategy of announcing voluntary pledges and initiatives at the start of COPs. These are meant to set a positive tone as delegations grind through two weeks of tough negotiations.In Dubai, this process went into overdrive, with a succession of non-binding agreements: from promises to triple global renewable energy and nuclear power capacity, to speeding the shift from coal and helping farmers improve soil quality.Others proved more contentious, with oil and gas companies promising to decarbonise their operations rather than reducing production of the fossil fuels responsible for global warming.In the first five days of COP28, dozens of voluntary partnerships were launched or expanded and at least 37 new financial pledges made, the Global Strategic Communications Council, which is tracking the promises, said.Some worry pledges could distract from the real business.“We’re always and – increasingly – cautious about the proliferation of additional declarations and pledges promoted at the COP,” said Daniel Lund, special adviser on climate to the island nation of Fiji.“Fiji has joined calls in the past that were meant to be long-standing initiatives, but were quickly forgotten.”Indonesia President Joko Widodo at a G77-China summit on the sidelines of COP28 said on Sunday that these pledges look good, but divert attention from what developed countries need to do now to combat climate change.“COP28 must be an event to accelerate implementation, not a show of ambition,” he said.Jake Schmidt, director of international programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the pledges require accountability to prevent an epidemic of “file and forget”.“While they create momentum for the talks at hand, it’s not clear there are a lot of mechanisms to hold people to account to deliver,” he added.BIG OILWhile oil companies have always had a COP presences, U.N. documents show, they have largely operated behind the scenes.But in Dubai, the COP28 president’s day job is running the UAE state oil firm, while heavy hitters such as Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods have been in the front row of high-level events.Drillers also briefly took the spotlight with a UAE-led pledge among 50 oil and gas companies, including Exxon, to cut CO2 emissions from their operations.“The promises made clearly fall short of what is required,” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told business leaders.The UAE, an OPEC member, has argued that fighting climate change does not have to mean eliminating fossil fuels because technologies can be deployed to keep emissions from the atmosphere – a position that has drawn widespread criticism.For former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, the whole COP process needs a rethink.“When you have a petrostate in charge of the process, then we have this ridiculous situation where the main polluters have to give their permission for the world to make common sense decisions to save the future of humanity,” he said.For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here.(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici, Katy Daigle, Kate Abnett, Sarah McFarlane, Bernadette Christina; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Alexander Smith)","December 4, 2023 - 15:29"
212,Olympics-Italy and Taiwan weigh in on boxing gender row,"(Corrects term to Differences of Sexual Development, not Differences of Sexual Disorder, in paragraph 7 of Aug 2 story)By Karolos Grohmann and Alessandro ParodiPARIS (Reuters) -A gender dispute in boxing swirled on Friday as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni raised the issue with International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach and Taiwan expressed support for its boxer embroiled in the row.Italian boxer Angela Carini pulled out of the Olympics mid-fight on Thursday after she sustained a series of crushing blows from her Algerian opponent Imane Khelif, who last year failed a gender eligibility test at the World Championships.“During the face-to-face meeting (with Bach), the case of athlete Imane Khelif and the issue of rules to ensure fairness in sports competitions were also addressed,” Meloni’s office said, adding that the Italian government and the IOC would stay in contact over how to deal with the matter in the future.Meloni said on Thursday that Carini’s bout against Khelif was not a fight among equals.Along with Taiwan’s double world champion Lin Yu-ting, Khelif was cleared to fight in Paris after the IOC last year stripped the International Boxing Association (IBA) of its status as boxing’s governing body over governance issues, and took charge of the Paris 2024 boxing competition.Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing IBA eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women’s events.Differences of Sexual Development are a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs. Some people with DSDs are raised as female but have XY sex chromosomes and blood testosterone levels in the male range.‘MINEFIELD’Taiwan’s presidential office and former president on Friday expressed support for Lin, who went on to win her featherweight round-of-16 bout against Uzbekistan’s Sidora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision.Pan Men-an, secretary-general for Taiwan’s presidential office, said on Facebook it was wrong for Lin to be “subjected to humiliation, insults and verbal bullying just because of your appearance and a controversial verdict in the past”.The IOC has said the IBA’s decision to disqualify the boxers last year was arbitrary and the main cause for the furore that has seen people including British author J.K. Rowling and billionaire Elon Musk criticising their participation in the Games.“Are these athletes women? The answer is yes,” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams told a news conference on Friday.“The Algerian (boxer) was born female, registered as female, boxed as a female, and is a female on her passport. Scientifically this is not a man fighting a woman,” he said of Khelif.“There is an awful lot of abuse and misinformed abuse going on online, we are in very close contact with the athletes (Khelif and Yu-ting) and their entourage,” he said.Some sports have limited the levels of testosterone allowed for athletes competing in women’s competition, while others ban everyone who has been through male puberty.“This is a minefield and as with all minefields we want a simple explanation. That explanation does not exist,” Adams said. “If we can get to a consensus, we would be happy to implement that,” he said.(Reporting by Alessandro Parodi in Gdansk and Karolos Grohmann in Paris; Writing by Ingrid Melander;Editing by Sharon Singleton and Helen Popper)","August 3, 2024 - 11:33"
213,Switzerland leads the way in Europe on organic food,"In a Europe-wide ranking, Switzerland is first in per capita organic consumption ahead of Denmark, Austria, Luxembourg and Sweden, Biosuisse said. Germany is sixth and France a close seventh.Sales of organic products grew by just under 7% in Switzerland in 2023. General price increases account for 4% of this, according to the organisation. The market volume of organic products is just over CHF4 billion ($4.52 billion). The market share of organic products in the retail trade is therefore 11.6%.+ Swiss agriculture: pesticide-free, but not necessarily organicThe Swiss organic market almost reached a record level in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic. The current growth has not been driven by specialist organic retailers and direct marketers, as was the case at the time, but by large retailers Coop and Migros, department stores and specialist retailers.At the end of 2023, 7,362 farms had been certified with Biosuisse’s “bud” label. According to the organisation, they farmed an area of 190,280 hectares. With 21 new farms, the number of organic farms did not change much compared to the previous year.There was also only a slight increase in the number of certified traders and processing companies, with 48 new additions. At the end of last year, a total of 1,356 licence holders had been awarded the organic label.Canton Graubünden has the largest proportion of organic farms, accounting for almost two thirds of the total. Bern remains the canton with the most organic farms, totalling 1,370. With one-fifth of its production being organic, wine production exceeded other forms of agriculture in this statistic for the first time.At its annual media conference, Biosuisse emphasised the importance of partnerships with retailers for the development of organic farming in Switzerland. Together, they have succeeded in taking organic farming out of a niche. “In view of ongoing price discussions, we must clearly position ourselves in the market and show why organic is worth the price,” said Biosuisse President Urs Brändli in a press release.Biosuisse is a Swiss organic organisation and owner of the bud label. The bud label and its certificate stand for sustainability. The umbrella organisation represents the interests of certified agricultural, horticultural, processing, and trading companies.Adapted from German by DeepL/dkk/dos","June 19, 2024 - 15:06"
214,"Soccer-Spanish court orders FIFA, UEFA to halt opposition to Super League","MADRID (Reuters) -A Spanish judge ordered soccer ruling bodies FIFA and UEFA to halt their opposition to a parallel European competition known as the European Super League (ESL), ruling they were practising anticompetitive behaviour and abusing their dominant position.Judge Sofia Gil Garcia ruled that the governing bodies violated European Union law by banning clubs from participating in a proposed new professional soccer championship, a court statement said on Monday.In the ruling, Gil Garcia also ordered FIFA and UEFA to immediately reverse any anticompetitive actions committed in the past.The case was brought by A22 Sports Management, the sports development company behind the plan to create the ESL, against the Spanish Soccer Federation, Spain’s LaLiga, UEFA and FIFA, who had blocked the ESL.“The era of the monopoly is now definitively over,” A22 CEO Bernd Reichart said in a statement after the ruling, calling it “an important step towards a truly competitive and sustainable club football landscape in Europe”.Reichart added that UEFA had stifled innovation for decades and clubs “should not have to fear threats of sanctions simply for having ideas and conversations”.Gil Garcia’s ruling followed a similar decision by the European Court of Justice in December.Both La Liga and UEFA insisted the ruling did not explicitly support the creation of the Super League.“The judgment does not give third parties the right to develop competitions without authorisation and does not concern any future project or indeed any modified version of an existing project,” UEFA said in a statement.The proposal in 2021 of a breakaway league by Europe’s 12 leading clubs sparked widespread protests among fans and threats of sanctions by UEFA, leading nine of them to pull out.A22 had said UEFA and FIFA held a monopolistic position that breached the EU’s Competition and Free Movement Law.The ECJ ruled against UEFA and FIFA, though it did not comment specifically on whether the ESL could go ahead.Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and nine other top European clubs announced the plan in April, 2021.The move collapsed within 48 hours, however, after a public outcry that forced Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid to withdraw.(Reporting by Inti Landauro and David Latona; additional reporting by Trevor Stynes; editing by Charlie Devereux and Ed Osmond)","May 28, 2024 - 17:24"
215,What The Top Woman in Swiss Watches Has Planned For Audemars Piguet,"(Bloomberg) — Before she was revealed as the new chief executive officer of Swiss luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet, Ilaria Resta went mystery shopping.The Swiss-Italian national popped into the brand’s boutique in Geneva with a friend. Without revealing her identity or new job, Resta told the salesperson she knew little about the company and its watches, which sell for an average of about 50,000 francs ($56,497).She wasn’t being totally disingenuous. Resta spent most of her career, more than two decades, at consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble Co., and was only a casual buyer of timepieces to mark significant milestones in her life. Before her visit to the Audemars Piguet boutique, she said she was intimidated by the high-end Swiss watchmakers.It’s a notoriously opaque sector and a key pillar of Switzerland’s economy — with just a handful of women occupying top executive roles. As the head of one of the five biggest brands by sales, Resta is arguably the highest-ranking female executive in the Swiss watch industry.“I’ve always believed the best leaders are the ones who learn and not the ones who know,” she said in an interview in Le Brassus, Switzerland, where the 149-year-old family-controlled firm is based. Resta is taking over the top job at a challenging time for both the company — now best known for its Gerald Genta-designed Royal Oak sports watch — and for Swiss watchmakers in general. Demand for pricey timepieces such as the Royal Oak has begun to wane after surging during the pandemic, when cash-flush consumers — stuck at home and inspired by social media — splashed out on established luxury models. Prices of these so-called hype watches, which included Patek Philippe’s own Genta-designed sports watch, the Nautilus, and Rolex’s Daytona chronograph, soared to unprecedented heights on the secondary market in 2021 and 2022. At the same time, waiting lists for new models at authorized dealers ballooned. Interest in smaller independent Swiss brands such as F.P. Journe, MB&F and watchmaking upstart Rexhep Rexhepi’s Akrivia also caught fire.In response, brands raised prices and released new models and a slew of collaborations, vaulting Swiss watch exports to successive records in each of the past three years. But higher interest rates, a strong franc and wars in Europe and the Middle East have begun weighing on the market. Demand for new watches has slowed and second-hand prices have largely skidded back to pre-Covid levels. A pre-owned Royal Oak Jumbo Ultra Thin that was fetching more than $138,000 at the peak two years ago can now be bought for about $64,000, according to the Bloomberg Subdial Watch Index, which tracks secondary market prices. That’s still about double the retail price. Resta’s predecessor Francois-Henry Bennahmias, who steered Audemars Piguet to record sales of about 2.4 billion francs last year, told Bloomberg News in November that he never expects to see the likes of the Covid-era boom again.Given this backdrop, Resta said her job is to maintain, manage and strengthen innovation at the Audemars Piguet brand for its private family shareholders, whatever the wider industry conditions. The company intends to remain independent, she said, even as potential suitors such as Bernard Arnault’s acquisitive LVMH luxury conglomerate have circled. “Uber-qualitative watchmaking. That is the mission,” said Resta, who took the helm on Jan. 1. “I’m not driven by growth that is aligned or not aligned with the market because at the end of the day, the market dynamics are not a reflection of our strategy.” Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Swiss industry consultancy LuxeConsult said Resta’s challenge as CEO will be to maintain positive momentum, but she’ll have to rely on organic growth as Audemars Piguet’s shift to selling directly to consumers in its own boutiques is largely completed.Resta’s mission is to stabilize the brand and capitalize on its transformation from a watchmaker to a luxury house, the analysts wrote in a recent industry report.Audemars Piguet is adding to facilities in Le Brassus and building an additional plant in Meyrin, near Geneva, to produce cases and bracelets, but Resta said not to expect significant production increases this year. Instead, the brand will double down on complications, quality of materials, finishing and craftsmanship. Prices will reflect costs, research and development and labor.“I don’t have pricing as a factor of my business strategy,” she said. “For me, what drives is the ultimate goal of sustainable long-term independence.”In one of her first executive decisions, Resta said she would extend Audemars Piguet’s industry-first service program that guarantees to replace or repair watches that are stolen or damaged for two years from the date of purchase. Watches bought in 2024 will now be eligible for the service. She also confirmed the brand is working on a certification program that will see it get involved in buying and selling its own used watches. Industry giant Rolex’s foray into officially certifying its used models at the end of 2022 marked a legitimizing moment for the second-hand market. Resta declined to say when its program might begin. Bare Concrete WallsHer sparse but sprawling office is a testament to her mission. The walls are concrete and bare. Four full-sized desks have been pushed together for her executive team to gather round for work on a jumbo-sized computer screen. The only accessories are a few coffee-table books on watchmaking and the history of Audemars Piguet. During her time at P&G, Resta oversaw and built brands ranging from hair care products to the category-creating-Swiffer broom. She then took on a senior leadership role at Geneva-based Firmenich as head of global perfumery and ingredients.Luxury watch collectors and enthusiasts, she said, aren’t so different from the army of Swiffer devotees who can elevate a product to legendary status through passion and loyalty.At her anonymous visit to the boutique in Geneva, Resta and her friend talked with the salesperson about the history of watchmaking and Audemars Piguet for more than an hour. Only then was a potential purchase discussed. “His mission was to turn these two women into people who are passionate about watches,” Resta said of the employee. “He passed with flying colors.”©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","March 18, 2024 - 07:01"
216,HSBC partners with Google to hit $1 billion climate tech finance goal,"By Simon Jessop and Sinead CruiseLONDON (Reuters) – Britain’s biggest bank HSBC has partnered with Google to finance fast-growing climate technology firms behind some of the world’s most promising solutions to global climate change, executives from both firms told Reuters.Under terms of the partnership, HSBC will look to provide financing to companies cherry-picked by the U.S. technology giant to join its Google Cloud Ready-Sustainability programme.Members of the programme undergo a validation process, with Google assessing quality and efficacy of the technology in development as well as its traction among customers.“What we’re seeing is companies wanting to accelerate delivery of their sustainability goals. But there’s a degree of confusion as to which solutions out there are going to help solve their problems,” said Justin Keeble, managing director for global sustainability at Google Cloud.“HSBC’s finance will help those partners scale their businesses, and then HSBC will help customers access all this innovation.”Martin Richards, global head of climate tech and sustainable finance at HSBC, said Google’s due diligence provided “a certain comfort” that complemented the bank’s own assessment of potential new ‘venture debt deals’ – where a lender provides debt financing for inherently riskier companies.Scaling technologies that can help the corporate world move more quickly to a low-carbon economy dominated the COP28 climate talks in Dubai in December, and is a crucial part of most banks’ efforts to drive a global push to cut emissions.But finance to the sector fell sharply in 2023, PwC data shows, as investors and lenders fret about risk.“We feel like we are increasing our odds of success by working with partners like Google. We recognise we’re taking credit risks but that is all part of banking,” Richards said.AMBITIONThe tie-up with Google’s cloud computing arm comes a year after HSBC bought the UK unit of failed tech lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a deal brokered by the UK government in an attempt to avert contagion in the startup world.The availability and impact of venture debt remains a key concern for policymakers. SVB was a significant player in the space but more mainstream lenders have tended to eschew the market, citing risks to capital.Research from the International Energy Agency suggests almost half the emissions reductions needed to hit net-zero by 2050 will rely on currently unscaled technology.Just six months after acquiring SVB UK, HSBC said it would aim to provide $1 billion in funding to climate tech companies across a range of sectors, including electric vehicles, battery storage and sustainable food systems by 2030.Richards said HSBC was “well ahead” of internal targets on that goal, and was hopeful the partnership and the launch of HSBC Innovation Banking would accelerate progress towards a more ambitious target of transitioning 1.3 million clients to net zero by 2050.The 30 companies in the initiative provide cloud-based tech solutions designed to help customers reduce their carbon emissions by processing data on their sustainability risks.“If you’re an airline, and you need to get to net zero using sustainable aviation fuels, you’re going to need to know the players who will come to market quickest and meet their production goals fastest,” Richards said.Over time, HSBC would facilitate introductions between existing customers and climate tech firms to aid transition, he added.Alongside news of the tie-up with Google, HSBC said it had also inked the partnership’s first venture debt deal with a startup called LevelTen Energy, which runs a marketplace for buyers and sellers of renewable energy.Lending terms were not disclosed.“Technology and finance are going to be key enablers of climate action. HSBC were very drawn to our belief that essentially the sustainability challenge is really a Data Challenge,” Google’s Keeble said.“And increasingly, our mutual customers are having to manage vast amounts of data and uncover useful insight from that to take action.”","February 8, 2024 - 20:02"
217,‘Artificial tree’ from Switzerland to produce green hydrogen,"The parabolic dish installed on the campus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) does not go unnoticed. With a diameter of seven metres and pointed towards the sky, it looks like a telescope. However, it is designed not to receive radio waves from space but to use sunlight and water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.It’s the first demonstration of solar hydrogen production at a system level, according to Sophia Haussener, head of EPFL’s Renewable Energy Science and Engineering Laboratory. This means that unlike experimental devices in the lab, this prototype contains everything it needs to produce hydrogen continuously.The system called Arb, derived from the Latin word for tree, was patented by SoHHytec, an EPFL start-up, and promises to overcome two of the main problems hindering the development of green hydrogen: the high cost of producing and the difficulty of transporting what is considered the energy carrier of the future.Arb can produce hydrogen close to its place of use and at a similar, if not lower, cost than so-called grey hydrogen, which is generated from methane and coal. Currently, 96% of the hydrogen produced in the world comes from fossil sources.This has enabled SoHHytec to raise more than CHF3 million ($3.4 million) in funding. Above all, the start-up has been able to convince companies from the metallurgy, energy and logistics sectors, which rely on renewable hydrogen to reduce their CO2 emissions. After ten years of research and development, the “artificial tree” is ready to bear fruit.Sunlight is reflected from the parabolic mirror and concentrated in a reactor located at the focal point. In the reactor, the electric current generated by the sun splits water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) – in a process similar to photosynthesis in trees and plants.The system rotates on itself and follows the sun’s position in the sky to maximise output (see video below). It can produce hydrogen even in cloudy weather or at night by connecting to an external source of electricity.What makes it unique is the ability to recover the heat and oxygen generated during the process. The heat could be used to heat buildings or certain industrial machinery, while the oxygen, often considered a waste product, could be used in hospitals to treat patients with respiratory failure.SoHHytec claims Arb has a higher efficiency than conventional green hydrogen production plants, which run on solar or hydropower. Even taking into account heat and oxygen recovery, the efficiency approaches 80%, according to the start-up.The hydrogen can be tapped directly from the Arb system. It has a purity of more than 99% and is pre-compressed in the reactor, making it ready for use, says co-founder Saurabh Tembhurne. With a production of about half a kilogram of hydrogen per day, the prototype could power a fuel cell vehicle that travels about 70 kilometres.The photochemical reaction for producing green hydrogen has been known for decades, but its practical implementation has faced challenges so far. The system developed at EPFL marks a significant step towards sustainable energy solutions, writes mechanical engineer Canan Acar from the University of Twente in the Netherlands in an email to SWI swissinfo.ch. She has been researching green hydrogen for more than 15 years. “Its localised production capacity, mitigating the need for extensive transportation logistics, further adds to its practicality and scalability,” she writes. The lifespan of Arb is estimated at about 20 years, and to increase production, it is enough to either increase the diameter of the parabolic dish or multiply the number of “artificial trees”, as the following animation shows:From February 2024, the first demonstration plant will be operated next to a metal construction plant in Aigle in southwestern Switzerland. The company Zwahlen & Mayr will install five 20-megawatt dishes with a diameter of nine metres – in other words, a small forest of Arbs. These will cover around 20% of its hydrogen needs to heat water, according to the company’s deputy director, Christian Charpin.SoHHytec plans to export its innovation. There are plans for a park with a thousand Arbs in California that will produce up to 2,400 tonnes of hydrogen a year. Such plants can, for example, provide green fuel for heavy transport and power 150 trucks that travel 500km a day.Saurabh Tembhurne believes that by using only concentrated sunlight, the price of producing green hydrogen in the United States could drop to about $2.50 (CHF2.20) per kg, a cost similar to that of grey hydrogen made from methane. (In Switzerland the price is currently CHF15-23 per kilo). If there were also hospitals in the vicinity that were prepared to buy the oxygen from the operators, as is planned for the Swiss metal company, the cost of hydrogen would fall even further.SoHHytech is also in discussions with partners in India, including chemical producers and transportation companies that want to replace diesel in trucks and trains with hydrogen. The success of these kinds of technologies is linked to the context in which they are deployed, Canan Acar notes. For example, the efficiency and feasibility of solar hydrogen systems are highly dependent on geographical and climatic conditions. “Regions with high solar irradiance will benefit most, but the viability may be limited in areas with less consistent sunlight,” she points out.Existing industrial structures need to be technically adapted in order to integrate the Arb systems. This requires economic considerations and careful planning on the part of companies, Acar says. SoHHytec is focusing on the industrial sector for now, offering companies to invest in its infrastructure or enter a long-term agreement to purchase hydrogen at a set price. However, the start-up does not rule out the possibility of residential applications in the future. The use of hydrogen in residential settings is still uncommon and subject to strict local regulations, says Saurabh Tembhurne. “However, we could imagine smaller parabolic disks for single-family houses, with which people will produce energy and heat in their own backyard,” he says.Edited by Sabrina Weiss","December 5, 2023 - 09:00"
218,EU lawmakers back delay to sector-specific ESG corporate disclosures to 2026,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) – European Union lawmakers on Wednesday backed a two-year delay in sector-specific rules for the oil, energy and mining industries, to make more detailed disclosures on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, citing the need to ease regulatory burdens on companies.The European Parliament’s legal affairs committee approved a draft proposal from the European Commission to delay eight sector standards by two years until June 2026. EU member state approval is also needed.The sectors cover oil and gas, mining, road transport, food, cars, agriculture, energy production and textiles.The aim is to give companies time to focus on implementing initial, broader ESG disclosures they must include in their annual reports for 2024 and onwards under the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive (CSRD).The delay follows an announcement by EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness last year that she had asked the EU executive’s corporate reporting advisory body EFRAG to prioritise implementing CSRD before working on the sector standards.It is the latest sign of how climate-related rulemaking is facing some pushback in the EU after a welter of legislation, echoing a larger backlash in the United States, as policymakers seek to ease red tape on companies to boost growth.“We will delay the deadline for sector specific standards under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) by two years in order to give EFRAG the time to develop quality standards and give companies the time to put them into practice,” said Axel Voss, a German member of the centre-right EPP party.“Companies have been putting up with too much bureaucracy in years of crisis, from Covid to inflation.”The EPP party has called for a moratorium on new climate-related rules as the European Parliament readies for elections in June.","January 24, 2024 - 15:04"
219,‘High costs are not prohibitive for premium destination Switzerland’,"Among the key tourism organisations in Switzerland, the federal corporation Switzerland Tourism occupies a special place.This organisation has the mission of promoting Switzerland around the world as a travel destination for holidays and conferences.At the head office of Switzerland Tourism in Zurich, SWI swissinfo.ch spoke to Gadient, the organisation’s president since 2020.SWI swissinfo.ch: This summer, there was talk of tourist destinations in Switzerland being overrun, like the village of Lauterbrunnen in Bern. Does the prospect of overtourism bother you?Brigitta M. Gadient: Fortunately, we don’t have overtourism in Switzerland, unlike cities like Venice and Barcelona, where cruise ships dock. The average occupancy rate of hotels in Switzerland is only 45%.In addition, our promotional activities are aimed at spreading out tourists over the whole country and throughout the year.Of course, it’s not possible to avoid occasional influxes of tourists, but the local authorities are able to manage these out-of-the-ordinary situations quickly and efficiently.SWI: How do you see the future of tourism in Switzerland?B.M.G.: I am very optimistic because this country has so many advantages – the purity of our countryside and the beauty of our cities. Our infrastructure is exceptional. I am thinking of the reliability and punctuality of Swiss trains. Of course, our sustainable approach is appreciated more and more by many tourists.What’s more, tourism is the nation’s fifth-biggest sector in terms of export revenue. In the Alpine cantons like Graubünden, where I come from, tourism is of vital importance.As for our high costs, they are a challenge to be sure, but they are not prohibitive for a premium destination like Switzerland.Parliament has approved funding for Switzerland Tourism for the next four years (a maximum of CHF233 million or $258 million). Are you happy with what you’re getting?B.M.G.: Not at all! The increase of three million compared to the previous four years is in fact a significant reduction, especially as inflation is now running over 10% in our foreign markets.Actually, our missions and activities just keep growing, with, for example, the promotion of sustainable tourism. In fact, we have been dealt budget cuts all over the place. We are going to have to tighten our belts.SWI: That still represents a fair amount of money for your promotional campaigns. Aren’t tourist numbers due to the actions of other organisations too, or even just to the reputation enjoyed by Switzerland?B.M.G.: In our marketing strategies, we don’t take a scatter-gun approach but a highly targeted one. For example, one of our initiatives might have the objective of attracting a particular segment of tourists from a particular country, at a particular time of the year, and with a particular region of Switzerland in mind.Another promotional activity might be to get visitors to stay longer in Switzerland than the average stay. Thanks to this targeting, we’re able to evaluate with some precision the effects of these initiatives.SWI: In general, are you mainly trying to attract local tourists as a priority, those from neighbouring countries, or those from countries further away?B.M.G.: In response to the pandemic, we’ve developed a strategy to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of our tourism industry. In other words, we are trying to establish a balance of tourist flows based on where they’re from, with 45% of tourists residing in Switzerland, 35% coming from neighbouring countries and 20% coming from further away.SWI: What is the point of dividing your marketing efforts in this way?B.M.G.: Swiss tourists are a priority because they guarantee stability for the service providers. However, the locals usually travel during the period of school holidays and on weekends and stay more often in holiday apartments.But many four- and five-star hotels also need customers on weekdays and outside the school holidays. For this reason, we need foreign tourists too, especially those coming from far-away places, even if that can sometimes present a cultural challenge.SWI: Which of your promotional campaigns are you most proud of?B.M.G.: Our worldwide campaigns involving Roger Federer, Switzerland’s best ambassador, have been a great success. We showcased train travel to promote sustainable tourism. Of course, many other initiatives that were smaller and more targeted, like the use of influencers, have had very positive results.The Switzerland Tourism advert featuring Swiss tennis player Roger Federer and American actor Robert de Niro:SWI: What criteria do you use to allot funding to your offices abroad?B.M.G.: We have identified four levels: priority markets (which generate a million hotel stays a year), active markets (over 100,000 stays), the “outliers” (with over 40,000 stays) and emerging markets (where the development of numbers of overnight stays is being tracked).The higher the priority level, the more staff we have on the ground, and the wider the range of things we do; as for the emerging markets, we manage them from our head office in Zurich. Our biggest overseas operations are in the United States and Canada (18 staff), Germany (17), “Greater China” [mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan] (12), and Britain and Ireland (11).SWI: And yet out of the 270 employees of Switzerland Tourism, 52% are based at the head office in Zurich rather than out in the field. Is this proportion justified?B.M.G.: I believe so, because many support activities for our international operations are provided from headquarters. I am thinking, say, of the production of promotional materials.SWI: Switzerland Tourism works for the whole of Switzerland. How do you divide up your efforts to ensure you serve each region fairly?B.M.G.: We maintain a constructive dialogue with the 26 cantons divided into 13 tourist regions. We offer all of them a basic service paid for by the federal government, but on top of this, each region – or rather, each group of regions – can pay for further services tailored to their particular needs.So the Matterhorn region often shows an interest in far-off countries whereas other Swiss regions prefer to concentrate on particular European countries.The important thing is to make sure we coordinate our activities at the national level so that we can maximise our global impact. Some regions would like more services, but it’s in the nature of things to always want more.You were a member of parliament for 17 years. As president of Switzerland Tourism, do you find that experience useful?B.M.G.: Certainly! That experience gave me a detailed understanding of the approval process for our budget, 56% of which is financed by the federal government. What’s more, I know a lot of parliamentarians and federal civil servants, which is very useful.Edited by Samuel Jaberg. Translated from French by Terence MacNamee/gw","November 5, 2023 - 10:30"
220,Learning democracy through games in Taiwanese schools,"Check out our selection of newsletters. Subscribe here.The voices and shouts of Class 805 can already be heard in the corridor of Sanmin Junior High School. Through open doors, a room full of 14-year-old students can be seen tapping their tablets in concentration. Welcome to democracy class.Their task is to identify the most important political players in national politics. In addition to faces and slogans, the teacher, Yi Ting Jhang, presents well-known symbols and pieces of music associated with different Taiwanese political camps on a screen at the front of the class.“I know him,” a pupil, Jia-Ruei, shouts out to the class. “My parents are voting for him.” “No way,” says the pupil next to her, Yan-Cheng Hou. “I’d never vote for that guy.”“After the politicians, now let’s take a look at the policies,” Jhang says, and presents the various parties’ policy proposals in a playful way using short, animated comic sequences.The girls and boys in Class 805 first discuss these in small groups, and then as a class, before they are allowed to vote electronically and secretly for their political priorities for Taiwan.This is a test run. Sanmin Junior High School, with 400 pupils, is one of several dozen pilot schools for the new curriculum, which is due to come into force in five years. Taiwan’s future curriculum aims to educate young people to become “global citizens”.“Democracy education” is already considered a core subject and has corresponding resources in terms of teaching materials and teacher training. “With the use of modern technologies such as generative artificial intelligence in the classroom, the new curriculum goes one step further,” Jhang explains.She then presents the conclusion of the lively lesson to her students in the form of colourful tables on the screen: the politicians the class chose do not correspond to their political priorities.“Don’t be fooled by politicians. Take a closer look,” the teacher says. The class responds in astonishment, and the objective of the day’s lesson has been achieved.Taiwan invests more in democracy education than almost any other country in the world.The Swiss education expert Petra Huth sees this as a consequence of “the history of the introduction of democracy and the geopolitical environment”.Attitudes in Switzerland are different, she says. “Many people here are convinced that we already live in the best democracy and that it’s enough if knowledge about it is taught at home, at the kitchen table.”Around 24 million people live in Taiwan’s 36,000 square kilometres. For the island state, democracy education is seen as a survival strategy in the context of a hostile neighbourhood dominated by autocracy, she says. In Switzerland, with an area of 41,000 square kilometres and nine million inhabitants, surrounded by the peaceful European Union, political education is still treated as an unnecessary optional subject, Huth says.The results are correspondingly different. “For the first time, our students achieved the best results worldwide,” says Mei-hui Liu, a professor at the National Taiwan Normal University, referring to the latest results of a large-scale comparative study.The International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) directed by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) was implemented for the third cycle in 2022, with 24 participating countries worldwide. Young Taiwanese performed well on the “civic knowledge” measure. Switzerland took part only in the first study in 2009. Young people in Switzerland achieved rather average scores.The global study of democracy education examines dozens of skills and competences that young people can use to become responsible and active citizens.These include how young people view political participation, the value they place on state institutions and human rights, as well as how they view ethical issues as consumers.In Tainan, 350 kilometres south of the capital, Taipei, a visit to a high school is on the agenda. This afternoon, the four-member election committee is analysing the results of several student votes on furnishing and activities on the campus of Tainan First Senior High School.This was preceded by collecting signatures in favour of certain proposals and debates in the school’s own parliament. “We are practising everything we will need later in life as adults,” says 18-year-old Shao-fan Wang, who chairs the election committee and can imagine going into politics as an adult.But it seems Wang is somewhat alone in his desire for more political activity.Not much political engagement outside school“Most students say they don’t have the time or inclination for political engagement outside school,” says Mei-hui Liu. “We still have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to involving the younger generation in politics in Taiwan.”The gap between the relatively well-prepared youth and the participation of young citizens in official politics is wider in Taiwan than in other democracies.For example, a constitutional referendum that would have harmonised the voting and electoral age recently failed due to a lack of support. Today, young Taiwanese can sign popular initiatives and vote in referendums at the age of 18. But they are not allowed to vote in elections until they are 20. And anyone running for a local or national parliamentary seat must be at least 23.Despite this contradiction, Huth, a political scientist and economist, sees Taiwan as a role model when it comes to anchoring democracy education in Swiss schools as an integral part of the curriculum.“In Switzerland, lots of things have entered the national ‘Curriculum 21’,” she says, referring to the curriculum for 21 German-speaking cantons. “For example, cookery lessons. But civic education does not exist as a separate subject area – instead it’s an aspect of sustainable development and is integrated into learning objectives across all subjects.”Huth, a former managing director of the Dialogue Foundation and a councillor in the municipality of Anwil in canton Basel Country, says that in Switzerland “national initiatives for democracy education are met with scepticism in the cantons, because education is the remit of the cantons”.However, she sees it as “very important to start democracy education in schools at an early age, before children reach adolescence and have completely different concerns”.Edited by Mark Livingston.

221,Zurich historian on elections in India: ‘I have a lot of hope for the future’,"Bhattacharyya is historian from India currently teaching at the University of Zurich. She holds the chair of the history of the Anthropocene. Her research, for instance, traces how British colonial rule shaped the ecology of West Bengal, in the process creating Kolkata – the city where she grew up.SWI swissinfo.ch: You come from the metropolis of Kolkata in West Bengal, in eastern India. Are the big questions ahead of the Indian elections the same there as in the rest of the country?Debjani Bhattacharyya: Not at all. West Bengal is governed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC), which is not part of the ruling alliance of Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In West Bengal, a key concern is stopping Modi’s government’s new Citizenship Amendment Act. This law, announced by the government in 2019, went through parliament in early March, but the Supreme Court’s decision is still pending.SWI: The state of West Bengal is officially against the new act?D.B.: Yes. There are many states on the border with Bangladesh, as well as in other parts of India, that are against it.SWI: What is the aim of the controversial act?D.B.: It will make it easier for persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries to obtain citizenship: for Sikhs, Buddhists and Christians. But Muslims who are persecuted in Myanmar, for example, will be excluded.The act also introduces evidentiary requirements and cut-off dates for citizenship. In the state of Assam, where implementation has already begun, around two million members of the population

do not feature on the citizens’ register. They are at risk of statelessness. Even if they are citizens, it will be difficult for them to prove it. They need a birth certificate, a school certificate – but in many of these villages there are no schools; this is where the poorest of the poor live. Particularly in Assam, many people have lived on both sides of the border with Bangladesh. The borders have been fluid here since 1947 and since Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971. Until a few years ago, there were 71 Bangladeshi enclaves in India and three Indian enclaves in Bangladesh. Today, around 10,000 people live in villages

that do not appear on any map. There are also people who move seasonally to different places along the river floodplain. They are being completely disenfranchised.This is a big problem and a hot topic in the coming elections.SWI: India is a federal state. How much can West Bengal decide for itself independently of the national government?D.B.: India had a federal structure. Over the past decade, centralisation has set in – in various forms. One leverage factor is the central government’s management of budgetary funds, though the Goods and Services Tax. Since the turn of the millennium, various governments have introduced this tax system in order to stimulate business across state lines. The BJP then introduced it in 2017. The funds from the Goods and Services Tax go to the central government.SWI: Is funding cut if a state steps out of line?D.B.: No, but payments are delayed. If you pick up a newspaper in West Bengal, you will constantly see headlines about withheld funds.SWI: What are Indian newspapers saying about the free trade agreement with Switzerland and other members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)? This is a big issue in Switzerland.D.B.: I learnt about it from the Neue Zürcher Zeitung – and not from the three Indian newspapers I read each day. That was strange. When I tried to read up, I hardly found anything in the Indian media outside specialised business journals. If anything happens with Germany, France, the UK, the United States or Australia, it gets attention in India; but it’s different with Switzerland. This is interesting because Switzerland is present in India. One of my students is researching the presence of Nestlé, which dates back to the 1950s – even though the Indian economy was protectionist at the time.SWI: In Switzerland, NGOs such as Public Eye are criticising the agreement as it could expose the Indian drug industry to lawsuits from the Swiss pharmaceutical sector.D.B.: Personally, I am ambivalent about it. Should there really be such agreements, if freedom of the press is limited in India, democracy has failed and political violence is occurring? Perhaps. Perhaps such agreements create jobs; India has high unemployment. In India, the debate has in any case taken a different turn. All Indian parties focus strongly on welfare. Over the past ten years, the central government has cut back funding for sustainable programmes such as MGNREGA

. This scheme provides work for 100 days for the unemployed and offers upward social mobility for some people in rural areas.Instead, politicians are handing what are known in political science as “freebies”. In West Bengal, there is competition between the central government and the local government. The prime minister’s photo adorns gas cylinders. Young women receive money through a programme named after the TMC chief minister of West Bengal. This essential support is accompanied by populist rhetoric – from the right within the central government, and from the centre-left in West Bengal.SWI: What is your view of the ruling TMC in West Bengal?D.B.: It is credibly secular, an exception in today’s India. Since the 1990s, when neoliberalism transformed the Indian economy, religiosity has found its way broadly into politics; whereas we started out in 1947 as a country with a secular constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru – a great statesman in my opinion – wanted industrialisation and development. He used to say that dams were the temples of the new India. Indian secularism is not laicism, but rather a form of ecumenism. We already had a BJP government in the early 1990s, but its leader – unlike Modi today – attended every Islamic festival. It was the done thing.SWI: You said Nehru held that dams were the temples of the future. Does Modi see the future in dams and Hindu temples?D.B.: You could say that. After all, Modi opened the Sardar Sarovar Dam more than half a century after the foundation stone was laid. During his first election, the springboard was development, not religion. He said then that Gujarat presented a development model that could be applied to all of India. He places the stakes on building dams and temples. Dams, temples and big statues.SWI: A year ago, the German Konrad-Adenauer Foundation

predicted that Modi would be elected for the third time in 2024. There now seems to be little doubt about this.D.B.: There is a good chance that he will serve a third term. He will be one of India’s longest-serving prime ministers. Over the past few years, we have seen India’s return to global power. We are a bulwark against China – which is why the loss of democracy and growing inequality are seen as less important by the US, Western Europe and Australia. India is a major buyer of weapons. The Indian Ocean is a critical region for current geopolitical disputes. Under Modi, India has gained a seat on the United Nations Security Council.Many Indians, especially wealthy members of the diaspora, see Modi’s India in a positive light, as a strong nation run by a strong man.SWI: It looks as if “strong men” are currently dominating politics in many places. As a professor of the history of the Anthropocene, would you say that such figures are an expression of this age in which humans are shaping the planet?D.B.: Yes. These strong men are emerging at a time of ecological change. Even if the oil and gas industries deny it and the extraction of raw materials, such as uranium in India, continues unabated, we are already in a global transition. I fear that even the proposed green transition could turn nasty.SWI: Things could turn nasty?D.B.: We are living a complex situation. Firstly, we have made nature into a storehouse for supplies. At the same time, forms of ecological populism are emerging that present themselves as an alternative to technological modernity. In India, for example, people are turning massively to alternative healing methods. This is sometimes romanticised in the West, but overall it merely conceals the state’s inability to guarantee the infrastructure for a public health system.Another example is the River Ganges. After the recognition of Maori rights and indigenous knowledge systems in New Zealand, the River Wanganui became a legal entity, in a move rightly welcomed around the world. Following suit, in India the Ganges was declared a legal entity in the name of environmental protection, which only consolidated its mythical status in Hindu cosmology.SWI: All this sounds worrying. Do you still have hope for India’s political development?D.B.: This is the momentum today, but I have a lot of hope for the future. Modi is the most popular prime minister of all time. But things are changing in India. There is still a lot of opposition. The BJP is having a hard time asserting itself in some states. How long can economic inequality grow? For how long can a political system be built on creating religious, ethnic and yes, caste-based divisions? It won’t last forever.SWI: So you are optimistic in the long term?D.B.: It took 300 years for India to shake off British colonialism. I’m a historian. I see things in the long term.SWI: And in the short term what are you hoping for?D.B.: A strong opposition in parliament that can control the government. SWI: Many experts today call India an illiberal democracy. Do you share this assessment?D.B.: Yes. The free press has collapsed, so we can hardly speak of a fourth estate any more. Many media outlets are pro-regime – and anyway there is very little information and much clamour. SWI: The Supreme Court will decide on the new Civil Rights Act. Would you say that the judiciary is still independent?D.B.: The court has made mixed decisions over the past decade – sometimes balanced, sometimes pro-regime. But court cases are slow. If justice is delayed for too long, at some point it becomes unjust. We thus have political prisoners who have been awaiting verdicts for a very long time in prison. Certain aspects of the legal architecture have been turned into an instrument. In fact, this started even before Modi – and has simply intensified under this government.Edited by Mark Livingston.

222,Donor fatigue looms over humanitarian aid in Ukraine after two years of war,"“It’s quite shocking how Ukraine has fallen off the news headlines,” says Sarah Hilding. Speaking from Kyiv, the head of the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Ukraine does not hide her concern: “Funding is one of our main worries.”Although the UN received enough funding in 2023 to cover 69% of needs in the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, the organisation now fears that funds will dry up, particularly as the catastrophic situation in Gaza continues to overshadow the crisis in Ukraine.A full two years after the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, humanitarian needs in the country remain high. According to the UN, around 40% of the population – 14.6 million people – will require assistance this year.“The war really is relentless,” says Hilding. “Every single day civilians are impacted, people are killed, hospitals are destroyed or damaged, as are schools and other civilian infrastructure.” As an example, she recounts spending her morning in a shelter because of an air-raid alert.The front line has barely moved in the last year, but the whole of Ukraine continues to be regularly targeted by waves of missiles and drones. These attacks have intensified since December 2023.Humanitarian needs are highest in the regions close to the fighting, in the east and south of Ukraine. In these territories, which include those under Russian control to which UN agencies have no access, more than 3 million people need help. In the centre and west, some 4 million displaced people are also particularly vulnerable, according to the UN.“Frontline communities are exhausted. Their resources are drained,” says Hilding. Many of the people remaining in these regions are elderly. After two years of war, they have depleted their savings and rely on humanitarian aid to get water, food, and medical care. As time goes by, more and more people find themselves in this situation. “Because of the prolonged nature of this war, the needs of people who have remained have grown,” she adds.Then there are the people who fled at the start of the invasion and are now returning to find their homes have been destroyed or that the land they farmed is still mined.The UN’s coordinated aid plan for Ukraine in 2024 will cost $3.1 billion (CHF2.72 billion) to cover the needs of 8.5 million people. This is less than last year’s total of $3.9 billion, which reflects the UN’s goal to prioritise the most vulnerable people. This effort has been made in light of concerns about the generosity of donor countries.The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), an international NGO present in Ukraine which receives a share of UN funding, is also expecting a funding gap in 2024.“Things can get catastrophic very quickly if funding drops suddenly,” warns Athena Rayburn, the NRC’s regional head of advocacy for Ukraine. It is therefore important, she says, for humanitarian agencies to ensure that their response is as sustainable as possible. One of the NRC’s priorities this year will be to work with the Ukrainian government and civil society to determine which services could be delegated to them if humanitarian organisations were to run out of money.In the event of a funding gap, tough choices will have to be made. Some people will be deprived of vital aid. “This, for someone like me and for my colleagues, is heartbreaking. We see that people need help. We should be able to tell their story in a compelling way so that donors understand that when we say we need the money, we really do,” says Hilding.Two years on, the conflict appears to be stalling. In a country like Ukraine, where the government benefits from the financial support of major international partners, is large-scale humanitarian action still justified?“I would say so. From the moment there are emergency situations, people living in precarious situations, who are suffering from major violence, I think it’s entirely justified,” says Karl Blanchet, Director of the joint Geneva Centre of Humanitarian Studies of the University of Geneva and the Geneva Graduate Institute.According to him, it is too early for development actors such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund or the OECD to invest in the reconstruction of the country, as there are still too many uncertainties linked to the war.However, the expert underlines the risk that, in the long term, humanitarian aid creates dependency and generates parallel service systems. For example, a perfectly functional hospital run by an international NGO could emerge a few kilometres from another health facility run by the Ukrainian government, where staff and medicines are in short supply.The year 2024 could prove particularly difficult for humanitarian aid in Ukraine. As Western support begins to crumble, notably in the United States where Congress is blocking a new $60 billion aid package – mainly military – for Kyiv, the shadow of the US presidential election in November hangs over the humanitarian community.Former president Donald Trump is vehemently opposed to aid for Ukraine and could decide, if elected, to reduce American support for the country, which would have an impact on the conflict and on the work of humanitarian aid staff. Known during his previous term in office for his contempt for multilateral cooperation, Trump could also seek to cut the contribution of the US – the largest donor country – to the UN humanitarian system.“Elections or no elections, we are already worried about the fact that we’re not going to get enough funding,” says Hilding, who declines to comment on national politics. “I just hope that regardless of who’s in power anywhere in the world, humanity will show through in terms of funding for humanitarian operations.”At a time when crises around the world – from Gaza to Sudan and Yemen – are multiplying without being resolved, and the gap between funding and needs continues to widen, many emergency situations are chronically underfunded. Could Ukraine one day join the ranks of these so-called forgotten crises?“It’s very possible,” says Blanchet, although he stresses that the country has the advantage of being in Europe, and therefore close to the main donors. “Ukraine is less likely to become a forgotten crisis. But at some point, there’s going to be widespread [donor] fatigue.”Edited by Virginie Mangin/gw>>> Read our article on the phenomenon of forgotten crises, from the DRC to Myanmar and Afghanistan:","February 23, 2024 - 09:00"

The stacks, the heart of the electrolysis, will be produced at Siemens Energy’s Berlin site.

226,"G20 finance meeting to set aside geopolitics, focus on economics","By Andrea Shalal, Bernardo Caram and Leika KiharaSAO PAULO/BRASILIA/TOKYO (Reuters) -With their countries deeply divided over Israel’s attacks on Gaza, finance officials from the Group of 20 major economies are poised to set aside geopolitics and focus on global economic issues when they meet in Sao Paulo, Brazil this week.Brazil, keen to ensure a productive session that delivers consensus on key economic priorities, has proposed a much shorter closing statement than seen in recent years – a move already negotiated with other members, according to a Brazilian government source and two sources familiar with the draft.The South American country is the current G20 president.The latest draft, still being finalized, mentions the risks of global fragmentation and conflicts in general terms but omits any direct reference to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or the Israel-Gaza war, the sources said.Finance officials and central bankers from the U.S., China, Russia and the world’s other largest economies will meet in Sao Paulo to review global economic developments at a time of slowing growth, the growing strains of record debt burdens, and worries that inflation may not yet be tamed, which are keeping interest rates high.The International Monetary Fund last month said the chance of a “soft landing” in which inflation falls without triggering a painful global recession had increased, but warned that overall growth and global trade remained lower than the historical average.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine almost exactly two years ago roiled the G20, exposing long-simmering fault lines within the group and thwarting efforts by G20 officials to reach consensus on a final statement, or communique, after their meetings.India and Indonesia, which held the G20 presidency before Brazil, opted for chair statements summarizing areas of agreement and noting dissenting voices – namely Russia – but even that could prove difficult given the bitter divisions over the four-month war in Gaza. The war erupted when the ministers last met in Marrakech, Morocco in October, intensifying divisions between the United States and its Western allies, and non-Western countries in the G20.Brazil, Saudi Arabia and South Africa have been outspoken critics of Israel’s relentless assault on Gaza since the Oct. 7 surprise attack in which Palestinian Islamist group Hamas killed around 1,200 people and seized 253 hostages, one G7 source said. The retaliatory attacks have killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.The U.S., meanwhile, last week vetoed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, blocking a demand for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and pushing instead for a temporary ceasefire linked to the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.The deep differences over Gaza necessitated a different approach this year, the Brazilian official said, adding, “If the topic is included, there will be no consensus.”To prevent differences over Gaza from derailing progress on economic issues, Brazil proposed a shorter statement with no specific mention of either war. Washington argued against language holding Israel accountable, which South Africa and others had argued was needed if the statement mentioned and condemned Russia’s war against Ukraine, a G7 source said.G7 finance officials, also meeting in Sao Paolo, will be forceful in their condemnation of Russia and its war, a second G7 source said.‘BROADER ETHOS’Brazil wants to focus this week’s discussions on ending inequality and hunger, reforming international taxation, addressing sovereign debt distress and working toward sustainable development. Reforms of multilateral banks and climate finance will feature more prominently at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington in April, the Brazilian source and a G20 source said.Mark Sobel, the U.S. chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), said stripping geopolitics from the communique made sense for a group that had historically focused on economic and financial issues.“Yes, it reflects fractiousness, but it also reflects this broader ethos of the finance ministers and central bankers to focus on economic and financial matters in a technical way,” he said.One G7 official said the statement would likely be “concise and ambiguous, only mentioning issues where there’s no contention.”U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to underscore the importance of the G20 body, highlighting collaborative efforts to address global challenges such as sovereign debt and the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior U.S. official said.Yellen will meet with Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad to celebrate 200 years of U.S.-Brazil relations, an event the Brazilian official said was designed to highlight the South American country’s “interest in not embracing a divisive approach, but focusing on constructive efforts.”One unresolved issue is to what extent the U.S., Japan and Canada will prevail in demanding a mention of the economic impacts of geopolitical conflicts in the communique, the first Brazilian official said.But the failure of G20 foreign ministers to include the issue sent a strong signal, the official said.“The outcome of the sherpas meeting strengthens our understanding that the topic (of geopolitics) should not be included in the communique.”Eric Pelofsky, a former senior U.S. official now with the Rockefeller Foundation, said there was value in meeting in configurations like the G20, despite clear differences.“Sometimes talking without success is still talking. Maybe that means that at the end of the day, somebody has a coffee that they weren’t supposed to have and they find a bit of common ground that they weren’t supposed to know existed.”(Reporting by Andrea Shalal in Sao Paulo, Bernardo Caram in Brasilia and Leika Kihara in Tokyo; additional reporting by Christian Kraemer in Berlin; Editing by Paul Simao)","February 26, 2024 - 15:02"
227,"Pope Francis, in resource-rich PNG, urges fair treatment for workers","By Joshua McElweePORT MORESBY (Reuters) -Pope Francis on Saturday called for better treatment of workers in Papua New Guinea, a nation of some 600 islands in the Southwestern Pacific that has become a major target of international companies for its gas, gold and other reserves.In a speech to political authorities in the country, which is home to hundreds of tribal groups and more than 800 spoken languages, the 87-year-old Catholic pontiff also made a heartfelt appeal for an end to a spate of ethnic violence that has killed dozens in recent months.The pope, visiting as part of an ambitious 12-day trip to four countries, said PNG’s natural resources were “destined by God” for the whole community.“Even if outside experts and large international companies must be involved in the harnessing of these resources, it is only right that the needs of local people are given due consideration when distributing the proceeds and employing workers, in order to improve their living conditions,” said Francis.The pope said natural resources should be developed in a sustainable manner that “improves the wellbeing of all, excluding nobody, through … international cooperation, mutual respect and agreements beneficial to all parties”.Arriving for his speech at the APEC Haus, a conference centre built for the 2018 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Francis was greeted with a dance from a group of Papua New Guineans wearing traditional outfits featuring feathered headdresses and beaded skirts.The pope, who uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain, was rolled past an entry foyer with a curved timber screen inspired by a typical lakatoi tattoo design.In a speech welcoming Francis, PNG Governor-General Bob Dadae thanked the pope for his humanitarian advocacy and called the Catholic Church one of the country’s “key development partners”.PNG contains some of the largest known gold deposits and is a major exporter of natural gas and oil. The government, led by Prime Minister James Marape since 2019, has sought to boost local benefits from projects undertaken by international conglomerates such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Newcrest Mining.An economic update in May said that growth in the country was a modest 2.7% last year. The World Bank has said it is suffering a “human capital crisis,” with nearly half of children showing stunted growth. Home to hundreds of tribes, PNG has a long history of ethnic warfare. Violent attacks in three remote villages in July likely killed at least 26, according to the United Nations.Francis on Saturday said it was his “particular hope that tribal violence will come to an end”. He said he was appealing “to everyone’s sense of responsibility to stop the spiral of violence and instead resolutely embark on the path that leads to fruitful cooperation”.He called for a “definitive solution” to the status of Bougainville Island, the largest island in the Solomon Islands archipelago. Currently an autonomous region of PNG, the island voted overwhelmingly for independence in 2019. But years of political deadlock in PNG’s parliament have stalled the vote’s ratification.A sprawling country of mountains, jungle and rivers, PNG has a population estimated at anywhere from 9 million to 17 million. The Vatican estimates there are around 2.5 million Catholics in the country.Francis landed in PNG on Friday evening, after a trip to Indonesia, and will stay until Monday. He will then visit East Timor and Singapore before heading back to Rome on Sept. 13. It is his longest overseas trip yet.    Although Francis’ speech on Saturday touched on serious issues, the pope also showed some of his trademark humour. Noting the number of languages spoken across PNG, he said the diversity of expression fascinated him.“I imagine that this enormous variety is a challenge to the Holy Spirit, who creates harmony amid differences!” the pope said.(Reporting by Joshua McElwee; Editing by Leslie Adler and Sam Holmes)","September 7, 2024 - 17:07"
228,"Singapore air show kicks off with orders for China’s COMAC, Boeing","By Lisa Barrington, Brenda Goh and Joe BrockSINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore on Tuesday kicked off Asia’s biggest aviation gathering with orders for China’s COMAC and Boeing planes as the industry grapples with a rebound in post-pandemic travel demand in the face of severe supply constraints.More than 1,000 companies from more than 50 countries are participating in the biennial commercial and defence-focused Singapore Airshow, led by Western industry giants such as Airbus, Boeing and Lockheed Martin and their Chinese competitors such as COMAC and AVIC.Russian companies such as Russian Helicopters and Irkut that attended past editions of the show are not participating this year amid the war in Ukraine. However, Israeli companies Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which dropped out of the Dubai Airshow in November amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, are in attendance.Trade delegates donned hats and sunglasses on a hot, clear day to watch flying displays featuring military aircraft from Singapore, Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea and the United States, as well as the COMAC C919 commercial jet and an Airbus A350-1000 powered by 35% sustainable aviation fuel.COMAC, which brought its self-developed C919 narrow-body jet outside Chinese territory for the first time to the show, posted the first aircraft orders of the event on Tuesday morning, with China’s Tibet Airlines finalising an order for 40 C919 single-aisle planes and 10 ARJ21 regional jets, and China’s Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Group ordering 6 ARJ21s.Royal Brunei Airlines later announced a firm order for four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, while the U.S. planemaker also held a signing ceremony to mark a recently placed order for 45 of the wide-body planes by Thai Airways.Given its timing early in the year, there are typically fewer major order announcements at the Singapore air show than at its counterparts in Paris, Farnborough and Dubai.By the end of 2023, travel demand had made a near-full recovery from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, with domestic travel running 4% higher than pre-COVID levels and the international market lagging at 88% mostly because of China’s slower rebound, according to International Air Transport Association data.“We see 2024 as a real return to normal,” said Steven Townend, the CEO of Singapore-based aircraft lessor BOC Aviation. “The industry is growing, airlines are making money again on a global basis. For 2024, we’re really positive.”SUPPLY CHAIN STRUGGLESMajor suppliers, planemakers and engine producers have struggled to keep up with the rebound in demand after the sharp downturn during COVID-19 led to job losses, freight snarls and an industry skills shortage.Boeing, in particular, is under scrutiny after the mid-air blowout of a cabin panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX on Jan. 5 led the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to take the unprecedented step of freezing production of its best-selling single-aisle plane at 38 per month.Airbus this month announced a further delay in entry to service of its long-range A321XLR single-aisle jet to the third quarter from the second. Suppliers told Reuters that Airbus is producing about 50 A320neo family jets a month compared with a production plan that had foreseen 58 by end-2023.Christian Scherer, the CEO of Airbus’ commercial aircraft business, said on Tuesday there were many “pinch points” in the aerospace supply chain.“The production ramp-up is putting pressure into the supply chain everywhere and it is our job to tackle it,” he told reporters, adding that Airbus had deployed several dozen supply chain engineers to unlock bottlenecks.The production issues are delaying the ability of airlines to replace older jets with more fuel-efficient models as the industry looks to meet its goal of “net zero” emissions by 2050.Airlines are also looking to buy as much sustainable aviation fuel as possible to reduce their carbon emissions, even though it costs up to five times as much as conventional jet fuel.In Singapore, travellers will bear the cost of the transition towards green jet fuel, its transport minister said on Monday, as he announced the city-state’s plans for a levy on departing flight ticket prices from 2026.(Reporting by Lisa Barrington, Brenda Goh and Joe Brock; Writing by Jamie Freed; Editing by Michael Perry and Gerry Doyle)","February 20, 2024 - 17:02"
229,"Ukraine outnumbered, outgunned, ground down by relentless Russia","By Max HunderKRAMATORSK, Ukraine (Reuters) – As the Ukraine war enters its third year, the infantry of 59th Brigade are confronting a bleak reality: they’re running out of soldiers and ammunition to resist their Russian invaders.One platoon commander who goes by his call sign “Tygr” estimated that just 60-70% of the several thousand men in the brigade at the start of the conflict were still serving. The rest had been killed, wounded or signed off for reasons such as old age or illness.Heavy casualties at the hands of Russian forces have been compounded by dreadful conditions on the eastern front, with frozen soil turning into thick mud in unseasonably warm temperatures, playing havoc with soldiers’ health.“The weather is rain, snow, rain, snow. People get ill with simple flu or angina as a result. They’re out of action for some time, and there is nobody to replace them,” said a company commander in the brigade with the call sign “Limuzyn”. “The most immediate problem in every unit is lack of people.”On the cusp of the second anniversary of its Feb. 24 invasion, Vladimir Putin’s Russia is in the ascendancy in a conflict that combines attritional trench combat reminiscent of World War One with high-tech drone warfare that’s sending tens of thousands of machines into the skies above.Moscow has made small gains in recent months and claimed a major victory at the weekend when it took control of Avdiivka in the hotly contested eastern Donetsk region. A spokesperson for 3rd Separate Assault Brigade, one of the units that tried to hold the town, said the defenders were outnumbered seven to one.Reuters spoke to more than 20 soldiers and commanders in infantry, drone and artillery units on different sections of the 1,000-km frontlines in eastern and southern Ukraine.While still motivated to fight Russian occupation, they spoke of the challenges of holding off a larger and better supplied enemy as military support from the West slows despite pleas for more from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.Another commander in the 59th Brigade, who only gave his first name Hryhoriy, described relentless attacks from groups of five to seven Russian soldiers who would push forward up to 10 times a day in what he called “meat assaults” – highly costly to the Russians but also a major threat to his troops.“When one or two defensive positions are fighting off these assaults all day, the guys get tired,” Hryhoriy said as he and his exhausted men were afforded a brief rotation away from the frontlines near the Russian-occupied eastern city of Donetsk.    “Weapons break, and if there is no possibility of bringing them more ammunition or changing their weapons, then you understand what this leads to.”Russia’s defence ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment on the state of play on the frontlines.Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Ivan Havryliuk told Reuters that Ukraine had been forced onto the defensive by a lack of artillery ammunition and rockets, and that Kyiv was expecting Russia to intensify its assaults on several fronts.“If there are further delays to the necessary military aid, the situation on the front could become even more difficult for us,” he said in a written response.WANTED: FIGHTERS AND AMMOKyiv relies heavily on money and equipment from abroad to fund its war effort, but with $61 billion in U.S. aid held up by political bickering in Washington it is looking more exposed than at any time since the start of the invasion.A soldier serving in a GRAD rocket artillery unit, whose call sign is “Skorpion”, said that his launcher, which uses Soviet-designed ammunition held by few of Ukraine’s allies, was now operating at about 30% of maximum capacity.    “It became like this recently,” he said. “There aren’t as many foreign munitions.”    Artillery shells are also in short supply as a result of Western countries’ inability to keep up the pace of shipments for a drawn-out war. On top of the U.S. supply pause, the EU has conceded it will miss its target to supply a million shells to Ukraine by March by nearly half.Michael Kofman, a senior fellow and Russian military specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think-tank, estimated that Russia’s artillery was firing at five times the rate of Ukraine’s, a figure that Hryhoriy of the 59th Brigade also gave.“Ukraine is not getting a sufficient amount of artillery ammunition to meet its minimum defensive needs, and this is not a sustainable situation moving forward,” Kofman added.Moscow now controls almost a fifth of Ukrainian territory including the Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014, even if the frontlines of the war have largely stagnated in the last 14 months.Ukrainian officials have said their armed forces number around 800,000, while in December Putin ordered Russia’s forces to be increased by 170,000 troops to 1.3 million.Beyond personnel, Moscow’s defence spending dwarfs that of Ukraine. In 2024 it earmarked $109 billion for the sector, more than twice Ukraine’s equivalent target of $43.8 billion.A new law aimed at mobilising 450-500,000 more Ukrainians is slowly making its way through parliament, but for some soldiers fighting now, significant reinforcements seem a distant hope.    Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov recently referred to Ukraine’s artillery ammunition deficit as “critical” in a letter to the European Union, urging its national leaders to do more to bolster supplies.    His letter said Ukraine’s “absolute critical daily minimum requirement” was 6,000 artillery shells, but his forces were able to fire just 2,000 a day, the Financial Times reported.    DRONE WAR ON MASSIVE SCALEConventional warplanes are a relatively rare sight over the frontlines, largely because air defences act as a deterrent. Yet a different battle is raging in the skies, with both sides striving for the upper hand in drone technology.Drones – or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – are cheap to produce and can surveil enemy movements and drop ordnance with pinpoint accuracy.Kyiv has overseen a boom in drone production and innovation and is developing advanced, long-range UAVs, while Moscow has more than matched its rival with huge investments of its own, allowed it to nullify Ukraine’s early advantage.The scale is astonishing.On the Ukrainian side alone, more than 300,000 drones were ordered from producers last year and more than 100,000 sent to the front, digital minister Mykhailo Fedorov told Reuters.A strong focus now is on light, nimble FPV drones, where operators, or pilots, get a first-person view from an onboard camera. President Zelenskiy has set a target for Ukraine to produce one million FPV drones this year in light of the battlefield advantages delivered by the technology.Limuzyn, the company commander in the 59th Brigade, said Russia’s widespread use of drones had make it difficult for Ukrainian troops to establish or strengthen fortified positions.“Our guys start to do something, a drone sees them, and a second drone arrives to drop something onto them.”Drones have also forced the Russians to move valuable vehicles and weapons systems back by several kilometres, according to two Ukrainian drone pilots in different units.“It’s now very hard to find vehicles to hit… most vehicles are 9-10 km away or more,” said a pilot in the 24th Brigade with the call sign “Nato”. “At the beginning they were very comfortable being 7 km away.”    Two other Ukrainian drone pilots, “Leleka” and “Darwin”, both serving in the elite Achilles drone unit of the 92nd Brigade, described queues of two or three UAVs sometimes forming above the battlefield, waiting to hit enemy targets.Leleka recalled watching four drones from different Ukrainian units coming in to strike a target on one occasion: “It’s like taxis at the airport, one drone comes, then another, then a third.”    The same situation is true for the Russians, whose drones now comfortably outnumber Ukraine’s, according to Ukrainian pilots from three units. The Russian defence ministry said this month that the country had ramped up its production of military drones in the past year, without giving figures.    As the use from drones grows, both sides are bolstering deployment of electronic warfare systems which can disrupt the frequencies that feed commands from the pilot to the drone, making them drop out of the sky or miss their target.Darwin, a 20-year-old who dropped out of medical school to enlist when Russia invaded, compared the current drone arms race to that between aviation and air defence: planes dominated in World War Two, but modern air defence systems greatly limited their use in this war, he said.“In future, I am sure there will be an analogous situation with drones: The concentration and effectiveness of electronic warfare will become so big that any connection between an aerial vehicle and its pilot will become impossible.”","February 21, 2024 - 23:02"
230,Analysis-Nuclear warnings serve Putin’s purpose as he bids for new term,"By Mark TrevelyanLONDON (Reuters) – The prospect of six more years in power for Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to mean no let-up in nuclear tensions with the United States, as time runs out on the last remaining treaty that limits the number of warheads each side can deploy.Putin has boasted since launching his 2022 invasion of Ukraine that Russia has the world’s most advanced nuclear arms and said it could wipe out any aggressor.On Monday, three days after announcing he would stand for re-election in March, he presided at a flag-raising ceremony for two new submarines including the Emperor Alexander III, which last month tested a nuclear-capable Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile.While denying that Moscow is “brandishing” nuclear weapons and resisting calls to adopt a more aggressive doctrine on their possible use, he has placed his nuclear forces on raised alert and announced the deployment of tactical nuclear missiles in Belarus, his neighbour and ally.Last month he signed a law revoking Russia’s ratification of the global treaty that bans nuclear testing, although Moscow says it will not carry out a test – which would be its first since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union – unless the United States does so.Some security analysts say nuclear weapons have assumed greater importance in Putin’s thinking and rhetoric as his conventional forces have struggled in Ukraine and as Western countries have weaned themselves off Russian energy, weakening his ability to exert pressure by cutting off oil and gas.The Kremlin leader has no interest in talking to Washington about reducing nuclear risk, analysts say, because Moscow believes it is precisely the fear that it may resort to nuclear weapons that has deterred the United States and its allies from directly joining the war on Ukraine’s side.“How can you reduce the risk if you continue to play the nuclear card vis-a-vis the United States and NATO?” said former Soviet and Russian diplomat Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation.“How can you discuss something to make sure that nuclear weapons are never, ever actually used if you want to keep the threat – maybe not really high but at least at some kind of visible and credible level?”TICKING CLOCKBy the time Putin’s expected new term gets under way next May, there will be less than two years remaining until the New START treaty, which limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and bombs on each side, expires on Feb. 4, 2026.The agreement, originally due to run out in 2021, was hurriedly extended for five years after U.S. President Joe Biden was inaugurated at the start of that year.But the prospects for a further extension, let alone a more ambitious successor pact, look doubtful for many reasons. China’s nuclear build-up is a complicating factor, and it’s not clear who will be in charge in the White House by 2026.Putin this year suspended Russia’s participation in New START, and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last month that Moscow would not resume dialogue unless the United States dropped what he called its “fundamentally hostile course” towards Russia – a reference to U.S. backing for Ukraine which Biden has said is unshakeable.Putin has frequently talked up the potential of Russia’s new weapons systems such as the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile and Burevestnik cruise missile, and Ryabkov said Washington was wrong if it thought it could win a news arms race against Russia of the kind that U.S. President Ronald Reagan conducted in the 1980s.But such a contest would impose strains on Russia too.“Russia knows that an uncontrolled new nuclear arms race is something they would not be able to afford and do not really have the capacity to sustain. Even more so now that in most respects Russia is much weaker as a consequence of its war against Ukraine,” said Nigel Gould-Davies of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.He said sanctions, while they had not crippled Russia’s economy, were restricting its access to technology, citing the crash of its moon-landing mission in August as an example of a spectacular high-tech failure.Sokov, the former Russian diplomat, expressed a different view, saying Russia’s research and development programmes were far cheaper to run than those of the United States, and that Russia’s economy was in better shape than the Soviet Union’s in the 1980s.“We are heading into a new arms race anyway, actually. It will not be a quantitative arms race in terms of changing numbers, it will be an arms race about the quality of weapons and new types and new capabilities,” he said.“We will be living in a situation that is less stable and the prospects of arms control are quite bleak.”(Reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Gareth Jones)","December 12, 2023 - 08:07"
231,Britain’s anti-greenwashing rule for finance takes effect on May 31,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) -Britain’s financial regulator confirmed on Tuesday that its new bespoke rule to combat greenwashing would come into force from May 31 to stop investment firms inflating the green credentials of their products to retail customers.The new labelling rule is designed to protect consumers by ensuring sustainable products and services they are sold are accurately described, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Any reference to environmental, social and governance (ESG) sustainability topics in a product or service must be fair, clear and not misleading, meaning they can be substantiated.Trillions of dollars globally have flowed into investment products that tout their sustainability attractions, leaving regulators to play catch-up with new disclosure rules and other safeguards now being rolled out.“It gives us an explicit rule on which to challenge firms if we consider they are making misleading sustainability‑related claims about their products or services and, if appropriate, take further action,” the FCA said in a document on the rule.The watchdog said it was also consulting until mid-June on extending to portfolio management firms, including private equity, the sustainability disclosure requirements (SDR) being applied to asset managers since November.“As the SDR and labelling regime has been developed primarily for retail investors… the proposals to extend the regime are primarily aimed at wealth management services for individuals and model portfolios for retail investors,” the FCA said in its consultation document.The new rules would start to come into force from December, in phases over two years.“Confirming the new anti-greenwashing guidance and our proposals to extend the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and investment labels regime are important milestones that maintain the UK’s place at the forefront of sustainable investment,” said Sacha Sadan, the watchdog’s ESG director.“Our good and poor practice anti-greenwashing examples will help firms market their products in the right way.”(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Louise Heavens and Clarence Fernandez)","April 23, 2024 - 12:26"
232,Where the world – and Switzerland – stands on carbon offsets after COP28,"Within the 2015 Paris Agreement
External link
on climate change, Article 6 set a basis for regulating carbon offsets. It was meant to answer among other things the following questions: how should offsets be governed? And when a company funds a project to offset its greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere, what are the rules to make sure it happens?The two main provisions, known as Article 6.2 and Article 6.4, address the way that inter-governmental agreements and voluntary carbon markets, respectively, compensate carbon emissions.Article 6.2 allows governments to trade emissions reductions with one another bilaterally or multilaterally. It requires such agreements to promote sustainable development and respect environmental ecosystems, while ensuring that only one of the partner countries counts the emission reduction as a credit towards its national target.But the United Nations agreement lacked detail on how the mechanisms would be implemented, leaving countries, companies and specialised organisations operating in a carbon market with a loose framework.A further rulebook
External link
with conditions for the implementation of country-to-country offsets was agreed at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.Even before the Glasgow conference, Switzerland helped lay the groundwork by signing early agreements with Peru, Ghana, Georgia and Senegal. Intended to compensate for emissions generated by Swiss residents, measures such as electric buses or wood-burning cookstoves are financed in these countries.At the latest United Nations climate talks (COP28) in December, Switzerland doubled down on its commitment to offsetting some of its emissions abroad by signing more agreements, this time with Chile and Tunisia. That makes 14 countries
External link
 in total.Discussions over Article 6.2 continued in Dubai, on whether and how to implement controls and oversight on bilateral carbon trading.But it’s Article 6.4 – and the need for better rules relating to human rights and accountability – that was the focus at COP28.For the first time in seven years, voluntary carbon markets – where businesses, individuals and organisations under no legal obligation to make emissions cuts can trade offset credits – saw their demand fall in 2023 due to the many questions raised on their implementation. Many global corporations chased opportunities to compensate for their emissions, presenting their products to customers as “net-zero” or “carbon negative”.In 2022, the value of traded markets for carbon permits reached $909 billion
External link
 (CHF850 billion). Of that, the voluntary carbon market was worth around $2 billion 
External link
in 2022, with experts forecasting earlier last year that it could be valued at $10 billion to $40 billion by 2030. But it is calculated that the market has since shrunk by 80%.But in 2023, reports surfaced that a number of nature-based projects funded by the voluntary market did not deliver as promised. This included schemes developed by Switzerland-based South Pole, the world’s leading seller of carbon offsets, which pulled out of a key forest preservation project in Zimbabwe following investigations. The organisation said reports were “exaggerated”.A report
External link
by the NGO Human Rights Watch also highlighted human rights violations including forced relocations and the assassination of environmental activists linked to carbon offset projects. Critics accuse users of greenwashing through their carbon-cutting claims.In November, a UN body submitted draft proposals on better carbon credit mechanisms
External link
and methods to remove
External link
carbon from the atmosphere, such as the use of forests, oceans and technologies including carbon capture and storage. The proposals came a year after expected and were the starting point of discussions in Dubai.Ahead of the talks, COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber highlighted the need for “better-functioning voluntary carbon markets”. Then, at COP28, another major carbon offset project was confirmed between an Emirati developer close to Dubai’s ruler and African countries, to preserve forests totalling the size of the United Kingdom prompting even more questions about implementation.Negotiators in Dubai were faced with a call from the Article 6.4 supervisory body to use “credible methods” to estimate emissions cuts or carbon removals, due to past cases of overestimating projects.On the table were the issue of baselines for assessing the effectiveness of the offsets as well as mechanisms to show that offset projects would not have otherwise taken place. But civil society groups were most concerned about safeguards against human rights violations.Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), warned against adopting proposals that were “not up to snuff on really preventing the serious abuses that we have seen”.She called for a more robust grievance mechanism that would help affected communities submit complaints due to offsetting projects and is independent of governments and companies carrying out projects. David Knecht, energy and climate justice lead at Swiss NGO Fastenaktion, also said the package proposed at COP failed to include language to ensure the sustainability of projects to allow people’s lives to be improved, as required by the Paris Agreement.Negotiators failed to reach clear decisions on both carbon market mechanisms and carbon removals (reforestation for example) by the close of the Dubai conference. They also failed to beef up rules for Article 6.2. Instead, they proposed recommendations, leaving discussions to be carried over to the 2024 COP to be held in Azerbaijan.Countries also failed to agree on an existing definition of carbon removal which could be “natural” or involve technology such as carbon capture.“Removals need to remain removals for hundreds of thousands of years,” said Knecht. “In other words, a forest that has been reforested must remain a forest and not be burned.”That means project monitoring would have to continue even after the credit certificate is concluded, which could result in steep costs. With proposals made in Dubai failing to address the issue of long-term responsibility, Knecht said the public may ultimately have to pay, for instance, if a company running the project went bankrupt.Andrew Howard, senior director of climate policy and strategy at Verra, the largest carbon standards system, said at a COP28 event that the existence of organisations like his provided “healthy competition” between standards “to allow for innovation that is really good for climate action”.South Pole had worked with Verra, which reportedly
External link
issued more than one billion carbon credits, 90% of which were described as “phantom” and largely worthless. Verra has said the reporting was “off track”.With discussions over Article 6 left on ice, countries such as Switzerland, keen on offsetting their emissions through bilateral deals, are now thrown into doubt over how to anticipate future regulations. Carbon Market Watch, a research organisation, projected
External link
that “to avoid reputational damage and avoid the risk of future liability, countries must, at the very least, demonstrate exemplary levels of transparency in the existing initiatives”.Multinational companies, already shunning bad press over carbon markets and decisions to ban corporate members from using offset schemes, are also left in the lurch as they seek to regain the trust of consumers.A spokesperson for the Federal Office for the Environment wrote in an email that “Switzerland campaigned for effective rules that enable a global, robust market mechanism with high standards. It regrets that no agreement was reached on this at COP28. It will continue to campaign for this at the upcoming COP.” Axel Michaelowa, founding partner of the consultancy Perspectives Climate Group and a researcher at the University of Zurich, has worked for many years on climate policies, including as an adviser to developing countries.He told SWI swissinfo.ch that he was not satisfied with the outcome of the discussions on Article 6.The outcome means Article 6 “cannot serve its role as the benchmark for international carbon markets”, he said. For him, the rules proposed for voluntary carbon markets were much more solid than conditions being implemented in bilateral offset deals like Switzerland’s, that are made to fit individual circumstances.“We need a race to the top and not to the bottom,” he said. “For now, we’ll see more carbon cowboys riding into the prairie in the next year.”Edited by Veronica DeVore/Sabrina Weiss/Virginie Mangin","January 19, 2024 - 09:00"
233,AI Mania Driving Nasdaq 100’s Best Run Since 1999: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — A banner year for stocks is drawing to an end, with the market near all-time highs amid the artificial-intelligence exuberance and dovish Federal Reserve wagers.In the run-up to the final closing bell of 2023, the Nasdaq 100 wavered — while still set for its best year since 1999 after a $7 trillion surge. The S&P 500 came close to a record, and was 1% below the average full-year gain predicted in a recent survey with analysts, who forecast the index would end 2024 at 4,833.“If the stock market can break through that record high in any significant way as we move through January, it’s going to be very bullish on a technical basis,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co. “Whenever the market is rallying strongly at the beginning of a new year — when a lot of people are adjusting their investment-game plans — it tends to exacerbate the rally.”In a rates-obsessed world, the stock market saw a massive reversal this year after suffering its worst annual selloff since 2008. As traders ramped up bets the Fed is done with its hiking campaign — and will start easing policy in 2024 — global bonds were set for their biggest two-month gain on record.The S&P 500 traded just a few points away from its all-time high of 4,796.56 — extending its 2023 advance to 25%. Treasuries dropped after a weak $40 billion sale of seven-year notes. The dollar rose against most of its developed-market peers. The yen climbed as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda continued to prepare the ground for the nation’s first rate increase since 2007.From Nvidia Corp. to Microsoft Corp., the seven-largest US tech stocks were responsible for 64% of the gauge’s rally this year through last week as the AI frenzy took off. The Nasdaq 100 is up over 50% this year.The ‘Magnificent Seven’ — which also includes Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post 22% earnings growth next year, twice the S&P 500’s advance, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The key is how much of that is already baked into share prices, especially with expectations for a soft landing building.“Companies that have a defined and clear AI strategy with easy-to-follow metrics will likely continue to do well in 2024,” said Michael Landsberg at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Companies that have a hard time explaining their AI value proposition will not see a repeat of 2023, where most large tech was buoyed by the excitement and not necessarily the details of AI.”Investors have flocked to big tech in part on bets that they are best positioned to capitalize on AI due to their vast scale and financial strength. Those bigger profits have brought valuations down from nosebleed levels — but they’re still lofty. The Nasdaq 100 is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from a peak of 30 in 2020, it’s well above the average of 19 times over the past two decades.Although there has been a relatively high number of stocks with gains of over 100%, there haven’t been many outperforming the S&P 500, Bespoke Investment Group noted. In a typical year, on average, 48.7% of the benchmark’s members post larger gains than the index itself. In 2023, less than 30% of its members are outpacing the index. “This leads one to question whether the leaders (or laggards) continue to lead (lag) in the year ahead,” the Bespoke strategists said. “Looking at the past, the picture is not exactly favorable for that sort of rotation in either direction.”The market is “sitting on big gains” and most participants just want the year to end to register those gains, according to Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter. “But I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that when everyone seems to be leaning on one side of the proverbial canoe, it pays to move to the middle.”Warnings about a market that’s flashing overbought signals have been raising concern about a pullback, with some market observers saying that traders have gone too far, too fast in pricing in a dovish Fed pivot.While the recent ebbing of inflation is positive for the Fed, some other figures showing economic resilience could fuel consumer spending — working against the central bank’s aim to slow the pace of growth. That poses risks for the bond market heading into the new year.Falling yields have also driven the dollar lower in 2023, with the greenback on pace for its worst year since the onset of the pandemic. Much of the decline materialized in the fourth quarter on growing wagers that the Fed will sharply loosen policy next year.The drop in Treasury yields has effectively relaxed financial conditions in the US and “are hardly compatible with sustainably low inflation,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote.“The rally in the sovereign space looks overdone — hence the rally in stocks and the selloff in the US dollar look overstretched,” she wrote in a note.About a week ahead of the all-important US jobs report, traders were unfazed by data showing initial jobless claims rose to 218,000. Economists forecast a still-healthy 170,000 increase in December payrolls, consistent with resilient labor demand that has been key in powering the economy.Elsewhere, oil retreated for the fourth time in five sessions as rising inventories at the key US storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, partly offset a drop in national stockpiles to paint a mixed picture for demand.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Richard Henderson, Robert Brand, Jessica Menton, Elena Popina, Ishika Mookerjee, Jeran Wittenstein and Carmen Reinicke.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","December 28, 2023 - 21:47"
234,"Campus Gaza rallies may subside, but experts see possible ‘hot summer of protest’","By Brad BrooksDENVER, Colorado (Reuters) – About a dozen students arrested by police clearing a sit-in at a Denver college campus emerged from detainment to cheers from fellow pro-Palestinian protesters, several waving yellow court summons like tiny victory flags and imploring fellow demonstrators not to let their energy fade.Just how much staying power the student demonstrations over the war in Gaza that have sprung up in Denver and at dozens of universities across the United States will have is a key question for protesters, school administrators and police, with graduation ceremonies being held, summer break coming and high-profile encampments dismantled.The student protesters passionately say they will continue until administrators meet demands that include permanent ceasefire in Gaza, university divestment from arms suppliers and other companies profiting from the war, and amnesty for students and faculty members who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.Academics who study protest movements and the history of civil disobedience say it’s difficult to maintain the people-power energy on campus if most of the people are gone. But they also point out that university demonstrations are just one tactic in the wider pro-Palestinian movement that has existed for decades, and that this summer will provide many opportunities for the energy that started on campuses to migrate to the streets.EVOLVE OR FADE AWAYDana Fisher is a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., and author of several books on activism and grassroots movements who has seen some of her own students among protesters on her campus.She noted the college movement spread organically across the country as a response to police called onto campus at Columbia University on April 18, when more than 100 people were arrested. Since those arrests, at least 2,600 demonstrators have been detained at more than 100 protests in 39 states and Washington, D.C., according to The Appeal, a nonprofit news organization.“I don’t see enough organizational infrastructure to sustain a bunch of young people who are involved in a movement when they are not on campus,” Fisher said. “Either the movement has to evolve substantially or it can’t continue.”Following the initial arrests at Columbia, students there occupied a classroom building, an escalation of the protest that led to even more arrests. Similarly in Denver, police on April 26 arrested 45 people at an encampment protest at the Auraria campus – which serves the University of Colorado-Denver, Metropolitan State University and the Community College of Denver.Then on May 8, Auraria protesters staged a short-lived sit-in inside the Aerospace and Engineering Sciences building, developed in part with a $1 million gift from arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin.Students in Denver say the movement’s spread from the coasts to the heartland and to smaller universities shows it has staying power. Student protests also have flared outside the U.S.“We’re keeping our protests up and our encampment going until our demands are met, however long that takes,” said Steph, a 21-year-old student on the Auraria campus who declined to give their full name for fear of reprisals. “We’ll be here through summer break and into next fall if needed.”Fisher, the academic, said the police response to protests has helped ignite a sense of activism in a new generation of students. She thinks the current campus demonstrations foreshadow a “long, hot summer of protest” about many issues, and that the Republican national convention in July and the Democratic national convention in August will be ripe targets for massive protest.“The stakes have gotten much higher, and that’s very much due to the way that police have responded in a much more aggressive and repressive way than they did even back in the 1960s,” Fisher said, referring to student-led protests against the Vietnam War.“And then you just plop right down in the middle of all that the presidential election?” she said. “It’s a crazy recipe for one hell of a fall.”AFTER GRADUATION, A GHOST TOWNMichael Heaney, a American lecturer in politics at the University of Glasgow in Scotland whose research and books have focused on U.S. protest movements said the campus demonstrations are just one tactic in the wider movement to support Palestinians, an ongoing effort that goes back decades.Heaney said that the geographical diffusion of the university encampments to places like Denver is an opportunity to bring the message of the wider movement to places where it may not have been before.Heaney added that “protests for any movement are episodic” and pointed to the various manifestations of the African-American Civil Rights movement in the U.S., going back 200 years. Just because one moment of protest ends does not foretell its overall demise.He said pro-Palestinian protests in American cities this summer could grow if Israel’s offensive in Gaza continues, and that such demonstrations would have been stoked by the widespread university activism.On Denver’s Auraria campus, while students were cleared from the classroom building, about 75 tents remain on a grassy quad, where protesters say they serve 200 meals each day in a mess hall tent. One of the student protest organizers, Jacob, 22, said he’s convinced the facts on the ground in Gaza are what will sustain the encampment.“After graduation it may be a ghost town on this campus – but we’ll still be here,” he said. “We’re not going anywhere.”","May 12, 2024 - 17:08"
235,"Australia plans to halve migrant intake, tighten student visa rules","By Renju JoseSYDNEY (Reuters) – Australia on Monday said it would tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers that could halve its migrant intake over the next two years as the government looks to overhaul what it said was a “broken” migration system.Under the new policies, international students would need to secure higher ratings on English tests and there would be more scrutiny on a student’s second visa application that would prolong their stay.“Our strategy will bring migration numbers back to normal,” Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said during a media briefing.“But it’s not just about numbers. It’s not just about this moment and the experience of migration our country is having at this time. This is about Australia’s future.”Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over the weekend said Australia’s migration numbers needed to be wound back to a “sustainable level,” adding that “the system is broken.”O’Neil said the government’s targeted reforms were already putting downward pressure on net overseas migration and will further contribute to an expected decline in migrant numbers.The decision comes after net immigration was expected to have peaked at a record 510,000 in 2022-23. Official data showed it was forecast to fall to about a quarter of a million in 2024-25 and 2025-26, roughly in line with pre-COVID levels.O’Neil said the increase in net overseas migration in 2022-23 was mostly driven by international students.Shares of IDP Education, which provides placement and education services to international students, were down more than 3% in afternoon trade.Australia boosted its annual migration numbers last year to help businesses recruit staff to fill shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic brought strict border controls, and kept foreign students and workers out for nearly two years.But the sudden influx of foreign workers and students has exacerbated pressure on an already tight rental market, with homelessness on the rise in the country.A survey done for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Monday said 62% of Australian voters said the country’s migration intake was too high.Long reliant on immigration to supply what is now one of the tightest labour markets in the world, Australia’s Labor government has pushed to speed up the entry of highly skilled workers and smooth their path to permanent residency.A new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be set up with the processing time set at one week, helping businesses recruit top migrants amid tough competition with other developed economies.(Reporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Mark Porter and Michael Perry)","December 11, 2023 - 03:37"
236,Factbox-What new right-wing Dutch government plans to do,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) – After months of tense negotiations, Dutch nationalist Geert Wilders and his coalition partners have struck a deal to form a right-wing government. Here is an overview of their main plans:IMMIGRATIONThe coalition aims to have the strictest admittance policy for asylum seekers among EU countries and says it will request an opt out of common EU rules for migration.Border controls will be intensified, admittance procedures will be shorter and stricter, while foreigners who have already been denied asylum in another EU country will be sent away immediately.Family reunifications will be limited, and refugees and asylum seekers will no longer be prioritised for housing. Facilities for immigrants will be made more basic.Within the EU, the government will strive for stricter outside border controls and deals with non-EU countries to take in migrants.Labour migration will be curbed, as well as the flow of foreign students to Dutch universities.Workers from outside the EU who do not have specific knowledge or expertise will need a work permit and recruiting agencies will face stricter regulation, while knowledge workers will have to meet higher standards.The Dutch will also strive to limit free movement for people from countries joining the EU in the future.ENERGYThe government will aim to expand offshore natural gas extraction and nuclear energy production as part of plans to reduce the Netherlands’ dependence on “unreliable countries”.The government will stick to internationally agreed climate goals, but will not add any national restrictions on top of them.Plans under the previous government for an additional national carbon emissions tax for industry will be scrapped.AGRICULTURE/ENVIRONMENTFarmers will not be forced to reduce the large amount of livestock in the Netherlands, which was meant to cut back nitrogen oxide emissions, and farmers near nature reserves will not be forced to close businesses to meet environmental goals.The coalition will strive to ease EU environmental regulations for farmers, while domestic regulations will not be made stricter than EU laws prescribe.Diesel for farmers will become cheaper.The maximum speed on highways will be increased to 130 kph (80 mph) after being to reduced to 100 kph nationwide in 2020 in an effort to reduce nitrogen pollution.TAXES/SPENDING CUTSEnergy and income taxes will be lowered, while levies on share buybacks by listed companies and on banks announced late last year will likely be scrapped.A mandatory user contribution for healthcare procedures will be halved by 2027, and childcare subsidies will be increased in the coming years. Day care will be made nearly free.Plans will be financed with around 14 billion euros in spending cuts through 2028, including a billion euros through a freeze of government salaries and 100 million on the public broadcaster’s budget.Unemployment welfare would be limited to 18 months.INTERNATIONAL STANCEPolitical and military support to Ukraine will be sustained and the coalition will make it legally binding to spend at least 2% of Dutch gross domestic product on defence, in line with NATO agreements.Spending on foreign development aid will be cut by 2.4 bln euros.EU enlargement will not be supported unless countries fulfil all the relevant criteria.The government will aim to move the Dutch embassy in Israel to Jerusalem at an appropriate time.WHAT’S NEXTParliament is expected to debate the government plans on May 22, after which an independent intermediary will be tasked with forming the cabinet of ministers, a process that is expected to take weeks.","May 16, 2024 - 13:12"
237,"Biden, Kenya’s Ruto pledge protect democracy in Africa and beyond","By Andrea Shalal and Trevor Hunnicutt(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed Kenyan President William Ruto to the White House on Thursday for a state visit, pledging new partnerships on technology, security and debt relief to the leader of one of Africa’s strongest democracies.Ruto’s is the first state visit by an African president to the White House since 2008, a gesture toward the importance of a continent that is home to 1 billion people and nurtures close trade ties with China, but which ranks behind the wars in Ukraine and Gaza on Washington’s agenda.On Thursday evening, Ruto was the guest of honor at a lavish state dinner that drew a wide range of guests, from singer-songwriter Don McLean to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, the CEOs of Walmart and Pfizer as well as former President Bill Clinton. Former President Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan, made a brief appearance before the meal.“We may be divided by distance, but we are united by the same democratic values,” Biden said as he greeted Ruto on the South Lawn of the White House. Biden reminisced about his own visits to Kenya as a young man, hailing 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries after Kenya’s independence.“My visit takes place at a time when democracy is perceived to be retreating worldwide,” Ruto said, standing with Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other cabinet officials. Earlier, he had met privately with Biden in the Oval Office.“We agreed on the significant opportunity for the U.S. to radically recalibrate its strategy and strengthen its support for Africa,” Ruto said. Biden said he would designate Kenya as the first sub-Saharan African country to be a major non-NATO ally. Qatar, Israel and 16 other countries share that designation.Nairobi and Washington cooperate on fighting terrorism in Africa, stability in Haiti and supporting Ukraine.The Kenyan president arrived in the United States on Monday and visited Atlanta, then spoke with business executives in the White House on Wednesday. On Friday, he will discuss digital inclusion in Africa with Vice President Kamala Harris at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Successive U.S. governments have said they wanted to offer African countries a more sustainable and democratic alternative to relations with China and Russia, but Washington has failed to establish deep ties.The continent’s political landscape has been upended in the past year by a spate of military coups, wars and shaky elections that have given China and Russia greater influence. Biden hopes strengthening ties with Kenya, seen as a democratic stronghold, can help stabilize the continent and advance U.S. interests.In a joint statement, the two leaders said they would work together to support the Somali government in its fight against terrorism and asked warring parties in Sudan to allow humanitarian access to aid and agree to a ceasefire.GREEN ENERGY, HEALTH DEALSThe leaders announced new U.S.-backed investments in green energy and health manufacturing, along with a detailed plan to cut Kenya’s high debt load, most of it owed to China.The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announced $250 million in new investments in Kenya through the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. That includes $180 million for a major affordable housing project, a U.S. government official said, bringing the U.S. financing institution’s portfolio in Kenya to over $1 billion.The two leaders made a joint call for the international community to reduce the heavy debt burden of developing countries and do more to support poor countries that want to invest in development and climate technologies.They also called for the U.S. Congress to pass a bill to renew a U.S.-Africa trade pact.Haiti’s humanitarian crisis was another focus. Kenya’s plan to deploy 1,000 paramilitary officers to the Caribbean country as part of a U.N.-backed effort to curb gang violence and hunger has been delayed, sources told Reuters.On Wednesday, Biden told reporters he plans to visit Africa in February after the U.S. presidential election, an announcement that presumes the Democratic president will defeat his Republican opponent Donald Trump. Biden had earlier pledged to make a trip to Africa sometime in 2023.The dinner was held in a glass pavilion on the White House grounds that was lit by 1,000 candles. The menu included heirloom tomato soup, butter-poached lobster, smoked beef short ribs and a white chocolate dessert.Country singer Brad Paisley is headlining the dinner along with Howard University’s Gospel Choir, both of which are tributes to Ruto’s musical interests.(Reporting By Andrea Shalal, Trevor Hunnicutt and Jarrett Renshaw; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Don Durfee, Cynthia Osterman, Jonathan Oatis, David Gregorio, Heather Timmons, Diane Craft and Gerry Doyle)","May 24, 2024 - 03:25"
238,S&P 500 Extends Gains in Final Minutes of Trading: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Stocks saw their best three-day rally since November, fueled by speculation the Federal Reserve will be able to cut interest rates this year.The S&P 500 rose 1% after topping its average price of the past 50 days — a level seen by many chartists as key in maintaining the positive sentiment. A solid earnings season kept driving optimism after a pullback that made some areas of the market attractive. While the below-average trading volume raised concern about the sustainability of the advance, most industries gained.“Bulls will be looking to maintain their momentum after snatching last week from the jaws of bears,” according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “This week is light on high-profile economic data, but heavy on Fed members hitting the speaking circuit. Traders will be dissecting any comments they make about potential rate cuts.”The US equity benchmark rose above 5,180. Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. paced gains in megacaps. Micron Technology Inc. jumped on an analyst upgrade. Apple Inc. fell, with Warren Buffett revealing he’d cut his stake even after heaping praise on the iPhone maker. Treasury 10-year yields slid two basis points to 4.49%.Traders also kept an eye on the latest geopolitical developments, with Israel rejecting a statement from Hamas that it had accepted a cease-fire proposal to end the fighting in Gaza. Oil closed higher.Read: Fed Says More Banks Tightened Loan Standards to Start 2024Following Jerome Powell’s not-very-hawkish tone last Wednesday, investors waded through remarks from some of the many Fed officials due to speak this week.Fed Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said he expects high rates to slow the economy further and cool inflation to the 2% target. His New York counterpart John Williams said eventually there will be rate cuts — but the decision on when will depend on the totality of the data.Despite pressure from still elevated rates, strong corporate results have justified high stock valuations, according to strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute.“Solid corporate earnings keep us overweight US stocks,” a team led by Jean Boivin and Wei Li said Monday in their weekly market commentary.More than 80% of the S&P 500 companies have now reported first-quarter earnings, and profit growth has easily surpassed “mediocre expectations”, according to Gina Martin Adams at Bloomberg Intelligence. The index is now on pace for a 6.5% earnings growth, almost double pre-season estimates of 3.75%, she noted.Bets on double-digit earnings growth this year for companies in the S&P 500 are too lofty as Corporate America is likely to be challenged by higher rates, according to JPMorgan Chase Co.’s Marko Kolanovic.“Consensus earnings expectations for this year look too optimistic,” he wrote. Analyst projections imply S&P 500 earnings will rise 17% from the first to fourth quarter, a feat that requires high topline growth or substantial expansion, he added.“Better than expected Q1 S&P 500 earnings and the recent pullback in stock prices brought P/E multiples of several key US benchmarks back to attractive levels in our view,” said John Stoltzfus at Oppenheimer Asset Management.The backdrop for stocks remains supportive, driven by healthy and broadening profit growth, inflation that will likely resume falling, a Fed that is more likely to cut than hike rates, and surging investment in artificial intelligence, according to David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management.Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial remarked that stock-market breadth remains robust and momentum is also improving.Meantime, hedge funds are reversing their bearish stance on consumer stocks as the latest economic data and comments from the Fed revive bets on rate cuts.After four weeks of selling, hedge funds last week piled into consumer discretionary stocks, which saw the largest net buying during the week ended May 3, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s prime brokerage desk. The move was driven by long buys as well as the largest short covering since December 2023.“Mixed” messages from key US economic data and the accompanying swings in stock markets mean investors should load up on defensive sectors such as consumer staples, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.A soft landing or a so-called no landing, where growth is resilient even as rates stay high, both remain possible for the US economy, the team led by Michael Wilson wrote in a note. This uncertain backdrop warrants an investment approach that can work as market pricing and leadership between groups of stocks gets whipsawed by the potential outcomes.In corporate earnings, Arm Holdings Plc should show it continued to benefit from artificial-intelligence demand when it reports this week. Airbnb Inc. may be among gig economy companies posting slower growth. Uber Technologies Inc. should be a bright spot as it expands its pool of drivers and merchants, drawing more active users.Walt Disney Co., fresh off a victory in its proxy fight against activist investor Nelson Peltz, is set to impress as cost-cutting efforts take hold, the bet on streaming gets closer to paying off and its theme parks keep drawing visitors.Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","May 6, 2024 - 22:18"
239,Global watchdog proposes new ethics code to combat greenwashing,"By Simon Jessop and Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) – Firms that check environmental, social and governance claims made by companies will be asked to follow a proposed new ethics code to help combat greenwashing, the chief of a global standards body told Reuters.Trillions of dollars have flowed into investment funds touting green credentials, but these can be misleading, a practice known as greenwashing. As a result, companies are increasingly being asked to disclose more about their actions on climate change and other issues such as board diversity.Companies in the European Union and globally from this year will have to use new, mandatory disclosures on ESG and climate-related factors in their annual reports for 2024 and onwards.These disclosures will need checking by external auditors as a safeguard against greenwashing.Gabriela Figueiredo Dias, chair of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), said it was proposing revisions and additions to its ethics standards for auditing sustainability information from companies.The IESBA is an independent global body that sets ethics standards for business and other organisations.The standards spell out best practice for verifying a company’s sustainability claims by offering detailed instructions in areas such as accounting for the impact of corporate actions on emissions, relying on outside experts, and identifying and tackling conflicts of interest.“There is nothing more central to sustainable finance than the information that is provided to those who decide to invest or fund projects and businesses.”Dias said the proposed standards, which will be open for public consultation until May, would complement the development of new technical assurance standards from the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.“Ethics is the baseline for the whole infrastructure. If you think about… greenwashing and misinformation, (it) always has behavioural issues at its root and not technical reporting reasons.”    “It’s not because preparers and providers don’t know what they have to report and assure, it’s because there are ethical or independence issues such as conflicts of interest,” she said, for example, financial interests, pressure from client companies or their management, inducements or a lack of competence.Global securities watchdog IOSCO has encouraged the moves by IESBA to update its standards as climate related disclosures under mandatory rules, rather than private sector guidance, are rolled out, making enforcement against greenwashing easier.IOSCO board Chair Jean-Paul Servais said he welcomed IESBA’s action to call on issuers, investors and assurance providers to participate in the consultation.“Trust in such disclosures will be enhanced when they receive external assurance based upon globally accepted standards regarding ethical behaviour and independence.”IESBA said the proposed new standards could also be used by firms other than professional accountants for auditing sustainability disclosures, such as consultants, engineers or lawyers, responsible for more than half of sustainability reports.EU rules allows non-accounting firms to audit sustainability disclosures – which will be checked to a lower standard than financial statements – to provide competition for KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC, dubbed the Big Four who dominate corporate auditing.","January 30, 2024 - 02:01"
240,COP28: US touts climate leadership as oil and gas output hits record,"By Richard Valdmanis, Sarah McFarlane and Simon JessopDUBAI (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris sought to claim the mantle of global climate leadership for the United States on Saturday in a speech to the COP28 summit, listing a slew of initiatives to cut emissions and harness renewable energy in the world’s largest oil and gas producer.The address came on the second day of back-to-back speeches by world leaders at the conference in Dubai, where nearly 200 nations are hashing out an international approach to tackling global warming and debating whether fossil fuels should maintain a role in a future energy economy.“Two years ago, President Joe Biden stood on stage at COP26 and made a declaration of ambition: The United States of America will once again be a global leader in the fight against the climate crisis,” Harris said. “Since then, the United States has turned ambition into action.”She listed the more than $400 billion in subsidies provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate law, which has triggered a flood of clean energy investment. She also announced a new $3 billion pledge to the Green Climate Fund, which helps developing countries combat global warming.On the sidelines of the conference, the United States also unveiled new measures to curb emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations.“Today, we are demonstrating through action how the world can and must meet this crisis,” Harris said.The United States, the world’s second largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China, has seen a surge in investment for clean energy projects ranging from solar farms to wind turbines and electric vehicle battery factories in recent years.But it has also grown into the globe’s biggest producer of oil and gas – the main source of climate emissions – following a technology-driven drilling boom in the sprawling Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.That awkward coincidence underscores one of COP28’s most contentious questions: Can the world’s response to climate change involve continuing use of fossil fuels?Among the decisions nations must make will be whether to agree, for the first time, to gradually “phase out” fossil fuels and replace them with renewable energy sources.Harris told the conference that the United States supports phasing out of “unabated coal” use, but she did not mention other fossil fuels.The COP28 host, OPEC-member United Arab Emirates, hopes to sell a vision of a low-carbon future that includes, not shuns, fossil fuels – mainly through the use of technologies that can capture carbon dioxide to keep it from the atmosphere, or by making oil and gas operations cleaner.FOSSIL FIRMS VOW TO DECARBONISE OPERATIONSThe UAE on Saturday announced a commitment by 50 energy firms representing around 40% of global oil output to cut methane emissions from their operations to near zero by 2030, and eliminate all greenhouse emissions from their operations by 2050.U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil and Saudi Arabia’s Aramco were among the companies that joined the initiative, although both already had these targets in place via their membership of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI).Climate campaigners were skeptical of the pledges.“Net zero commitments that haven’t been backed up by plans and aren’t anchored in government regulation are not worth celebrating. We need to be moving from pledges to regulation,” said Catherine Abreu, founder of the non-profit Destination Zero.“We’ve seen a long history of oil companies making climate pledges that don’t result in real action.”John Podesta, a senior energy advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden, told Reuters on Saturday that record U.S. production was helping to keep consumer prices steady after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.He added that the United States has tried to reduce drilling on public lands and waters, but has been pushed back by courts, and that U.S. policy was now mainly focused on limiting demand for petroleum.“We’re in a context in which we need to reduce production of fossil fuels and … we need to be on a path of lower consumption. Our policies are aimed at doing that,” he said.The conference on Saturday also featured a slew of international deals to make energy systems more climate-friendly around the world, including by boosting renewable sources and nuclear energy, and by choking off financing for coal.Elsewhere, the United States was among a group of 56 countries to commit to steps to accelerate decarbonisation by 2030 across sectors including power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture.___For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here.(Writing by Richard Valdmanis; reporting by Valerie Volcovici, Sarah McFarlane and Simon Jessop; Editing by Katy Daigle, Kevin Liffey and Diane Craft)","December 2, 2023 - 16:19"
241,China told it faces ‘fork in the road’ as officials meet CEOs,"By Colleen Howe and Jing XuBEIJING (Reuters) -China needs to “reinvent itself” with economic policies to speed resolution of its property market crisis and boost domestic consumption and productivity, the International Monetary Fund’s Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Sunday.“China faces a fork in the road — rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,” Georgieva said in remarks to a meeting of senior Chinese officials and executives from global companies.Officials who spoke at the opening of the China Development Forum expressed confidence China would hit its economic targets, including growth of about 5% this year, and pledged further support for companies in strategically important sectors, an area Chinese President Xi Jinping has dubbed “new productive forces.”But those commitments stopped short of the more sweeping changes urged by the IMF. Georgieva said an analysis by the IMF showed a more consumer-centered policy mix could add $3.5 trillion to China’s economy over the next 15 years. If achieved, that boost would be equivalent to adding output equivalent to more twice the size of South Korea’s economy.To do that China would need to take “decisive” steps to complete unfinished housing stranded by bankrupt developers and to reduce risks from local government debt, the IMF chief said.“A key feature of high quality growth will need to be higher reliance on domestic consumption,” Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, said. “Doing so depends on boosting the spending power of individuals and families.”Other economists have also urged a new growth model for China. But the IMF remarks were significant in coming at the outset of a two-day meeting where Beijing is looking to push the message China is open for business.Foreign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20% in the first two months of the year, data released Friday showed, and officials have been stepping up efforts to attract investors at a time when many companies have been looking to “de-risk” supply chains and operations away from China.In 2023, foreign direct investment into China contracted by 8%, reflecting a shaky economic recovery and tensions with the United States and its allies on a range of issues.Apple CEO Tim Cook, the highest-profile executive at the Beijing event, told China state broadcaster CGTN he had an “outstanding” meeting with China’s Premier Li Qiang.Cook was quoted in state-run CCTV Finance saying that Apple’s Vision Pro will hit the mainland China market this year and that the company will continue to ramp up research and development investment in China.“I think China is really opening up,” Cook told a CGTN interviewer on the sidelines of the meeting. He later said Apple’s China-based suppliers had helped deliver gains in more sustainable manufacturing, including lowering water use and recycling metals like aluminum and cobalt.Stephen von Schuckmann, a board member and executive at ZF Group who oversees the auto supplier’s battery-drive operations, said the company was committed to China, which leads the world in electric car sales and production.“Any wording and hype about an exodus in the supply chain is not what we follow,” he said in remarks published by CGTN. “We’re invested. We’re here to stay.”Over 100 overseas executives and investors were attending the China Development Forum and a series of smaller closed-door sessions with Chinese officials on Friday and Saturday.China’s cabinet last week unveiled steps intended to win investment, including expanded market access and pilot programmes to encourage investment in science and technology.On Sunday, Li said China’s previously announced $140-billion plan to issue ultra-long bonds would create a fund to spur investment and stabilise growth.Other officials highlighted Xi’s commitment to drive investment in “new productive forces,” industries that officials have said includes networked electric vehicles, spaceflight and cutting-edge drug development.(Reporting by Xu Jing, Qiaoyi Li, Colleen Howe and Joe Cash in Beijing, writing by Kevin Krolicki, editing by Lincoln Feast and Louise Heavens)","March 24, 2024 - 13:03"

Now in its fourth year of existence, Planted employs more than 200 people and its products are sold all over Europe.The market for plant-based alternatives to meat is growing rapidly, as more and more people choose to reduce their consumption of meat products against the backdrop of the climate crisis and an increased concern for animal wellbeing. In Switzerland

as elsewhere in Europe

, research shows a strong increase in demand for products of this kind.Planted doesn’t have a CEO; it is run by an executive board made up of four members, one of whom is Judith Wemmer. SWI swissinfo.ch met her at the company’s headquarters in the Kemptthal industrial estate in the Zurich countryside.SWI swissinfo.ch: Plant-based alternatives to meat currently represent only 1% to 2% of the food market. What kind of development do you expect in this sector?Judith Wemmer: At this stage it’s mainly the early adopters who are buying our products, as was the case with the initial clients of Tesla [maker of electric cars] 15 years ago.These pioneering customers appreciate innovative products, although the prices are still high and their quality can be improved.After that, a period of vigorous growth will follow. But first we must continue to improve the quality of our products, for example by fine-tuning the fermentation processes.Furthermore, we have to diversify our range and lower our prices, by achieving economies of scale in the production process.SWI:A lot of plant-based alternatives to meat are ultra-processed products, associated with an increased risk of disease, in particular different forms of cancer. Can Planted avoid this pitfall?J.W.: Our production process is similar to that for making bread or pasta: we follow a series of steps meticulously to make our vegetarian meat. All our ingredients are natural and additive-free.Our bodies do not need specific foods, they need to absorb certain elements. We make sure that our products have a high concentration of proteins, fibre and micronutrients, and are low on saturated fats and sugar.Consequently, our production process doesn’t lead to the typically unhealthy products high in calories associated with the term “ultra-processed”. Our foodstuffs are created to correspond perfectly with a healthy and sustainable diet.SWI: Nutritionists say that plant proteins are not exactly the same as animal proteins. Does Planted work towards optimising the nutritional properties of its products?J.W.: Our main objective is to preserve the nutritional integrity of our product through each step in the production process. That’s why we don’t use any additives. The presence of essential minerals, such as iron, in our products is perfectly natural.Whatever their origin, all proteins have the same components, called amino acids. Planted provides all the essential amino acids. Legumes like peas are in general rich in amino acids such as lysine, leucine and phenylalanine but rather poor in methionine and cysteine.Vegetable proteins are best obtained by combining legumes, seeds and cereals. So, the ideal thing to do is to eat our products together with some rice, pasta or bread and so on.SWI: Which distribution channels do you have?J.W.: We sell online to everywhere in Europe. Our foods are also sold in eight European countries by restaurants and retailers, including Migros and Coop in Switzerland and Tesco in the UK.We have established several partnerships. One of these is our agreement with Fleury Michon, a French firm specialising in charcuterie, through which we sell three sorts of thinly sliced vegetable products.In order to support our international growth, we have established trade offices in Austria, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.SWI: Are you already making money?J.W.: We aren’t profitable yet. We could be, but we prefer to continue developing and investing, especially in research and in production tools.SWI: Who are your main competitors?J.W.: First and foremost the meat industry. Other start-ups from Switzerland and abroad are also operating in our field, but most of them focus on marketing and distributing products bought from external producers.Multinationals like Nestlé and Unilever are also showing an interest in plant-based foodstuffs.In any case, the market for food products is immense and so there must be room for a multitude of different actors.SWI: Oatly, the Swedish leader for plant-based substitutes for dairy products, is facing several challenges: global growth, high costs, production issues. How can you avoid a similar situation?J.W.: We are focused on our products, our innovation and the building of a solid Swiss company, not on how other companies are rated by the press and analysts.In any case, our very strong growth in Switzerland and abroad encourages us to stick to our path with determination.SWI: The production of vegetable protein generates 40 times less carbon dioxide than that of animal protein. Do governments reward your engagement with the climate issue?J.W.: Absolutely not, whereas a business like Tesla generates large profits through selling “carbon credits” to traditional carmakers.In the political arenas, meat-based products are supported by a powerful lobby… Besides, we would need to demonstrate in detail that our products are just as nutritious as those of the meat industry.Finally, the present attitude is not to intervene through tax policies to influence people’s food choices.SWI: Are you planning to start production abroad to lower costs and facilitate your logistics?J.W.: In the future we will certainly produce abroad, in fact we are looking for a potential location in Europe.Of course, we will always keep part of our production in Kemptthal in order to enhance the cooperation with our research and development departments.Edited by Samuel Jaberg and Pauline Turuban.

243,"UBS Must Revise Post-Takeover Emergency Plans, Finma Says","(Bloomberg) — UBS Group AG must revise its plans for emergency recovery and resolution to take account of the integration of Credit Suisse, Swiss financial supervisor Finma said.“The current resolution strategy for UBS only provides for the continuation of business activities as part of a restructuring of the business model,” Finma said in a release on Tuesday. “Based on the experience of the Credit Suisse crisis, additional options for action are required to further strengthen crisis preparations and resolution planning for systemically important banks.”UBS is in the midst of integrating its former rival following the emergency takeover last year, and is already facing substantially higher capital requirements as a result of its increased size and complexity. The collapse of Credit Suisse is currently the subject of a parliamentary investigation, and the findings, due by the end of the year, could also affect how UBS is regulated. Finma maintained that the lender continues to fulfill the requirement for loss absorption capacity and could also presently be resolved by a ‘single point of entry’ recapitalization. However, the bank must calculate more conservatively how much liquidity it can generate in a crisis, the regulator said. It must prepare more comprehensively for such an event, it added.“In its emergency plan, UBS must in particular revise the liquidity planning and the refinancing of the Swiss entity when the emergency plan is activated,” it said. Credit Suisse’s demise was accelerated by the unexpected speed of the withdrawal of client funds, aided by digital banking services. Finma said a new approach needs to take account of these changes. Already StartedUBS’s resolution planning needs to be further developed to ensure that the bank can exit the market by selling business units or the whole company, without jeopardizing the stability of the financial system or using taxpayer’s money, the regulator said. In an emailed statement, UBS said that it already started on this work.“UBS has a sustainable business model with a total loss absorbing capacity of around $200 billion,” the bank said. “UBS meets the current requirements to be resolvable in accordance with the preferred resolution strategy in the event of a crisis.”Finma suspended assessing the bank’s current recovery and emergency plans as UBS has to harmonize the group structures, processes and IT platforms after the combination with Credit Suisse, it said.The Swiss government presented in April a sweeping set of bank reforms based on lessons drawn from the crisis at the formerly second-largest Swiss lender. These could see an increase in regulatory capital requirements for UBS of around $20 billion. “As a global systemically important bank, UBS has to fulfill special crisis prevention requirements,” Finma said.–With assistance from Paula Doenecke.(Updates with further details throughout)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","October 15, 2024 - 10:19"
244,"US nods to ‘serious’ Japan, S.Korea concerns over slumping currencies","By Leika KiharaWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States, Japan and South Korea agreed to “consult closely” on foreign exchange markets in their first trilateral finance dialogue on Wednesday, acknowledging concerns from Tokyo and Seoul over their currencies’ recent sharp declines.The rare warning from the three countries’ finance chiefs came as receding expectations of a near-term U.S. interest rate cut pushed the yen to 34-year lows, keeping markets on alert on the chance of an intervention by Japan to prop up the currency.“We will continue to cooperate to promote sustainable economic growth, financial stability, as well as orderly and well-functioning financial markets,” according to a joint statement released after the trilateral meeting.“We will also continue to consult closely on foreign exchange market developments in line with our existing G20 commitments, while acknowledging serious concerns of Japan and the Republic of Korea about the recent sharp depreciation of the Japanese yen and the Korean won,” it said.The dollar slid to an intraday low of 154.18 yen after the statement, off the 34-year high of 154.79 yen hit on Tuesday. It stood at 154.24 yen in Asia on Thursday. Japan last intervened in October 2022 when the yen was at 151.94 per dollar.Washington’s acknowledgement of the currency concerns from Tokyo and Seoul may lay the groundwork for intervention, some analysts said.“While I don’t see a statement like this being enough to boost the yen and avoid an intervention, the language used there is pretty strong and I wouldn’t be surprised to see some concrete moves come out of Japan before the week is out,” said Helen Given, a currency trader at Monex USA.The trilateral gathering, attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki and South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok, was held on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and Group of 20 (G20) finance leaders’ meetings this week in Washington.Suzuki told reporters he also met Yellen bilaterally on Wednesday and explained Tokyo’s readiness to take appropriate action against excessive yen moves, without elaborating.Japan’s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda, who is also in Washington, said authorities would not rule out any options in dealing with excessive yen moves.He declined to comment, when asked about the possibility of coordinated intervention to slow the dollar’s ascent against other currencies, including the yen.“In the last few intervention cycles, American authorities – most notably Janet Yellen – issued statements acknowledging Japan’s motivations and providing verbal support,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay.“From a strategic perspective, currency intervention is far more likely to succeed when delivered through a coordinated international effort. Unilateral moves are helpful in mitigating volatility, but aren’t up to the task of reversing the yen’s long rate differential-driven slide,” Schamotta said.Finance leaders of the G7 advanced nations agreed to a Japanese proposal to reaffirm their commitment that excessive volatility and disorderly moves in the currency market were undesirable, Kanda told reporters after the G7 gathering.LASTING EFFECT UNLIKELYJapan and South Korea have seen their currencies slide against the dollar in recent weeks due largely to reduced bets of near-term cuts to elevated U.S. interest rates.Verbal warnings by Japanese authorities have failed to keep traders from pushing the yen down near 155 to the dollar, a level seen as Tokyo’s line-in-the-sand that heightens the chance of intervention.Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong said on Wednesday authorities have the resources and tools to smooth out any volatile moves in the country’s currency, signaling readiness to intervene in the market to shore up the won.“Our exchange rate deviated a little bit from what could be justified by market fundamentals,” Rhee said in an IMF seminar.Finance leaders of the G20 major economies have a long-standing agreement that excessive exchange-rate volatility and disorderly currency moves are undesirable.Tokyo has argued this G20 agreement gives it freedom to intervene in the currency market to counter excessive yen moves.But intervention could be costly and there is no guarantee it could reverse the current strong-dollar tide, which is driven by the big gap between U.S. and near-zero Japanese interest rates.“I’m not sure whether Tokyo would intervene just because the dollar breaks past 155 yen,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Japan’s Mizuo Securities.“Authorities probably feel that solo intervention won’t have a lasting effect when a strong U.S. economy is pushing back the timing of a Fed rate cut and driving up the dollar,” he said.(Reporting by Leika Kihara in Washington; Additional reporting by Saqib Ahmed in New York, Cynthia Kim in Seoul and Tetsushi Kajimoto in Tokyo; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jamie Freed)","April 18, 2024 - 05:48"
245,"S&P 500 Breaks Below 5,100 as Big Tech Sells Off: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) — Tech megacaps dragged down stocks as bond yields jumped after hot retail sales spurred bets the Federal Reserve will be in no rush to cut rates. Oil whipsawed on geopolitical angst.In a volatile session, the S&P 500 erased an earlier advance and fell over 1%. Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led declines in the rate-sensitive technology space. Volatility perked up, with the premium for one-month put options to protect against a pullback in US equities hitting the highest since October. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — hit levels unseen this year.“Stocks began to violate uptrends and pull back,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “Interest rates are expected to stay higher for longer. A more cautious and tactical approach is favored as earnings season gets underway.” The S&P 500 broke below 5,100, dropping to the lowest in almost two months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slid over 1.5%. Both gauges breached their 50-day moving averages — seen as a bearish signal by several chartists. Banks outperformed on a surprise profit from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Treasury 10-year yields spiked nine basis points to 4.62%, while those on two-year notes came closer to 5%. Bonds were also under pressure as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. tapped the US high-grade bond market, the first in a likely parade of bond sales from banks after results. West Texas Intermediate reclaimed its $85 mark — after briefly falling below it — and gold climbed on fears of escalating tensions in the Middle East. Top Israeli military officials reiterated the country has no choice but to answer Iran’s weekend attack.US retail sales rose by more than forecast in March and the prior month was revised higher, showcasing resilient consumer demand that keeps fueling a surprisingly strong economy. As long as a robust labor market supports household demand, there’s a risk that inflation will become entrenched.“If the S&P 500 is going to avoid its first three-week losing streak since last September, investors will need to move past concerns that rate cuts will be delayed because of sticky inflation,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “In the near-term, that could come down to the tone set by the first full week of earnings season, but geopolitical tensions in the Middle East remain a wild card.”The strong tailwind from easy financial conditions continues to boost inflation and growth, including consumer spending in March, said Torsten Slok at Apollo Global Management, who continues to bet the Fed will not cut interest rates in 2024.“The markets have been buoyed by strong corporate profits and the elixir of lower rates, but it seems like those two things are increasingly at odds with each other, so we would exercise some caution in the near term,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance.Expectations for monetary policy have been shifting toward a later start to Fed rate cuts, which officials have said requires a higher degree of confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path back toward their 2% target. Traders are no longer fully pricing in a rate cut before November.“In our view it’s not about ‘higher for longer’ when it comes to the Fed’s rate regime rather, it’s a continuation of the ‘pause for now’ until inflation gives up its stickiness,” said John Stoltzfus at Oppenheimer Asset Management.Due to the heightened concern that the Fed will be “slower to lower” interest rates, investors now worry that these sticky inflation readings will be viewed as a catalyst for correction, said Sam Stovall at CFRA.For all 24 corrections since World War II, it took the S&P 500 only four months to recover all that was lost in the decline, he added. Better yet, since 1990, the market got back to breakeven in only three months. “Therefore, history once again reminds us that, for long-term investors, it has typically been better to buy than bail,” Stovall said.Stubborn inflation, a robust economy and signals from Fed officials that interest rates will remain higher for longer have derailed traders’ optimism for an interest rate cut by summer. But that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily worried about the stock market.Soothsayers at Jefferies JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and State Street Corp. agree that the strength in economic data and corporate earnings is enough to keep this year’s stock market rally going — whether or not interest rates are dialed back.Stickier inflation stemming from strong economic momentum is better for US equities than stagflation, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Ohsung Kwon.“If inflation is sticky because of momentum in the economy, that’s not necessarily bad for stocks,” they wrote, adding “but stagflation is.”“Recent inflation data has laid to rest the notion of a Goldilocks US economy. Instead, investors and the Fed will have to put up with a bumpier disinflation path than they assumed at the start of the year,” said Jason Draho at UBS Global Wealth Management. “But overall macro conditions of trend-level growth, slow and bumpy disinflation, and a Fed ready to exercise its put of rate cuts is still supportive for risk assets.”Don’t bank on an upbeat corporate earnings season to drive equities higher as much of the optimism is already priced in following the record-breaking rally this year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote.“Equities have already had a good run into the results, suggesting that investors are more optimistic than the downbeat earnings projections by sell-side analysts convey,” they said. “We need to see clear earnings acceleration in order to justify current equity valuations, which we fear might not come through.”Strategists at BlackRock’s Investment Institute see signs of earnings growth broadening beyond US technology behemoths to other sectors like industrials and materials in this reporting period. Strong economic data and corporate earnings have supported risk appetite so far this year despite a jump in bond yields, but “earnings will need to deliver on high expectations,” team led by global chief investment strategist Wei Li said Monday in a weekly commentary note.An improving outlook for the US economy and continued easy financial-market conditions have prompted Wells Fargo Investment Institute to boost its outlook for the US stock market and corporate earnings estimates.The investment adviser raised its S&P 500 Index 2024 year-end forecast to range of 5,100 to 5,300. “A point of emphasis is that these year-end targets allow for potential market disappointments related to the track of inflation and the federal funds rate,” strategists at WII wrote.Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Alexandra Semenova, Sagarika Jaisinghani, Yongchang Chin, Alex Longley, Julia Fanzeres, Felice Maranz, Ye Xie, David Marino and Kasia Klimasinska.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","April 15, 2024 - 22:02"
246,"Japanese craft lands on the moon, scientists await contact","By Kantaro KomiyaTOKYO (Reuters) -Japan’s space agency on Saturday said it was examining the communication with its probe after it landed on the moon, during an attempt to become the world’s fifth country to achieve a moonshot and revitalise a space programme that suffered recent setbacks.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) landed the moon’s surface at around 12:20 a.m. (1520 GMT Friday) but it was still confirming the communication with the probe.Dubbed the “moon sniper”, SLIM attempted to land within 100 metres (328 feet) of its target, versus the conventional accuracy of several kilometres.JAXA says this landing technology will become a powerful tool in future exploration of hilly moon poles seen as a potential source of oxygen, fuel and water – factors necessary to sustain life. It will take up to a month to verify whether SLIM had achieved the high-precision goals, JAXA has said.Japan is increasingly looking to play a bigger role in space, partnering with ally the United States to counter China. Japan is also home to several private-sector space startups and the JAXA aims to send an astronaut to the moon as part of NASA’s Artemis program in the next few years.But the Japanese space agency has recently faced multiple setbacks in rocket development, including the launch failure in March of its new flagship rocket H3 that was meant to match cost-competitiveness against commercial rocket providers like SpaceX.The failure caused widespread delays in Japan’s space missions, including SLIM and a joint lunar exploration with India, which in August made a historic touchdown on the moon’s south pole with its Chandrayaan-3 probe.JAXA has twice landed on small asteroids, but unlike with an asteroid landing, the moon’s gravity means the lander cannot pull up for another try, its scientists said. Three lunar missions by Japanese startup ispace, Russia’s space agency and American company Astrobotic have failed in the past year.Only four nations – the former Soviet Union, the United States, China and India – and no private company have achieved a soft landing on the moon’s surface.SLIM’s successful touchdown and demonstration of the precision landing “will help Japan to keep its technology advanced at a very high level in the world,” Ritsumeikan University professor Kazuto Saiki has said before the touchdown attempt. Saiki developed SLIM’s near-infrared camera that will analyse moon rocks after the touchdown.The 2.4m by 1.7m by 2.7m vehicle includes two main engines with 12 thrusters, surrounded by solar cells, antennas, radar and cameras. Keeping it lightweight was another objective of the project, as Japan aims to carry out more frequent missions in the future by reducing launch costs. SLIM weighs 700 kg (1,540 lb) at launch, less than half of India’s Chandrayaan-3.As the probe descends onto the surface, it recognises where it is flying by matching its camera’s images with existing satellite photos of the moon. This “vision-based navigation” enables a precise touchdown, JAXA says.Shock absorbers make contact with the lunar surface in what JAXA calls new “two-step landing” method – the rear parts touch the ground first, then the entire body gently collapses forward and stabilizes.The precision landing “won’t be a game changer”, but the cost-reduction effects of it and the lightweight probe manufacturing might open up moonshots to space organisations worldwide, said Bleddyn Bowen, a University of Leicester associate professor specialising in space policy.“Not as big as the United States or the Soviet Union of old or China today in terms of scale, but in terms of capability and niche advanced technologies, Japan has always been there.”On landing, SLIM was due to deploy two mini-probes – a hopping vehicle as big as a microwave oven and a baseball-sized wheeled rover – that will take pictures of the spacecraft. Tech giant Sony Group, toymaker Tomy and several Japanese universities jointly developed the robots.SLIM was launched on Japan’s flagship H-IIA rocket in September and has taken a fuel-efficient four-month journey to the moon.(Reporting by Kantaro Komiya; editing by Miral Fahmy and Nick Zieminski)","January 23, 2024 - 14:36"
247,Swiss right-wing party hands in initiative to limit immigration,"The Swiss People’s Party submitted 114,600 signatures to the federal chancellery in Bern on Wednesday. It demands that a new article on “sustainable population development” be added to the constitution.According to the initiative, the population of permanent residents must not exceed ten million people before 2050. The government should then set a limit based on the birth rate. If 9.5 million people live in the country before 2050, the Federal Council and Parliament would have to act.For example, temporarily admitted persons would then no longer be able to obtain a permanent residence permit. Family reunification is also to be restricted. International agreements with exemption or protection clauses would have to be renegotiated. If all this is not enough, the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons with the European Union would have to be cancelled.According to a party statement today, the high level of support for this initiative, “shows that the population urgently demands sustainable and independently controlled immigration for Switzerland.”According to Marcel Dettling, newly elected party president who replaces Marco Chiesa, the People’s Party’s initiative shows, “how immigration can again be managed independently.” “Today, too many foreigners arrive, and the wrong ones.

248,Analysis-Aging Uruguay’s vote to drop pension age is rattling investors,"By Lucinda ElliottMONTEVIDEO (Reuters) – Uruguay heads to the polls to vote for a new president this month, but investors have a wary eye on another ballot: a referendum to lower the retirement age in the fast-aging nation that some fear may cripple the country’s finances.The small but relatively affluent South American country of 3.4 million people has long been seen as a bastion of free markets and private enterprise in the region, which has attracted tech and finance firms, and fast development along its Riviera coastline.But if approved, the reform would uproot a private pension system in place since 1996 and drop the retirement age by five years to 60, landing the government and the taxpayer with a large bill.The move echos popular anger with smaller pension pots elsewhere but would mark a rare instance of a country lowering its retirement age, with nations including France, Britain, Japan and China all recently going in the other direction.The reform has been promoted by left-wing unions, who argue that it would preserve workers’ dignity in retirement by allowing them more money for a longer period. Despite the opposition of most political parties, the unions secured enough support on a petition in April to force the plebiscite, which is binding.Opinion polls show around half of Uruguayans in favor of the reform, and about 40% against, although that number has been rising. The Oct. 27 vote needs a simple majority to pass.The reform would “make any current economic or social security policy unviable,” said Uruguayan economist Maria Dolores Benavente, adding it would mean the country going back to the “unsustainable system” that had been changed in the 1990s.The rising possibility of a pension reform has led the Uruguayan peso to weaken over 10% against the dollar since April.“If approved, (it) would compromise medium-term fiscal sustainability,” JP Morgan wrote in a recent note, adding that the retirement age drop would widen a pension deficit, while raising lower-end pensions would cost an extra $1 billion per year.URUGUAY’S ‘BREXIT MOMENT’?The reform proposes scrapping private pension schemes and shifting to a public model, which analysts say would put a bigger debt burden on the state, create legal complexities around transferring pension funds, and put Uruguay’s investment-grade credit rating at risk.Uruguay has one of the region’s oldest populations, with a median age around 36 years old, compared to 32 around South America. That creates a potential time-bomb for the economy down the road as a large wave of people retire.Conservative President Luis Lacalle Pou has called the reform “dangerous and harmful”, and says it would put public finances on an unsustainable path, “crushing” confidence. His coalition faces a battle to stay in power against a center-left coalition.Many voters in capital Montevideo, however, said the ‘yes’ campaign was winning them over, with the hope it would bring them more money.“We have meager pensions in Uruguay. Retirees in this country are poor,” said 68-year-old educator Jose Luis Correa, adding that he had to keep working out of necessity to cover his costs.“That’s why I support the end to private pension funds,” he added. “If they can cut out private pension fund managers, there’ll be more for us and future retirees.”Another Montevideo resident in his mid-50s, who asked not to be named but said he was planning to vote against the reform, said he was worried about his private savings and thought the “no” camp was not doing enough to convince people.Nicolas Saldias, Uruguayan analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the political classes were largely optimistic the referendum would fail, but may be misreading the mood among voters and could get a shock.“This could be Uruguay’s Brexit moment,” said Saldias, referring to the 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom to pull out of the European Union, when the government underestimated the level of public support for leaving.“The population may vote in favor of it, despite what the establishment is saying.”","October 11, 2024 - 12:04"
249,‘Less impressive and less important’: Switzerland’s role as an intermediary in Iran,"Check out our selection of newsletters. Subscribe here.SWI swissinfo.ch: Ebrahim Raisi’s term was marked by mass protests against the religious order in place and several political crises. Will anything change in Iran following his death? Cyrus Schayegh: There are two answers here, and they’re a little bit different from each other. Basically, the answer is no. The reason is that the president in Iran doesn’t really have the power to decide foreign policy. This as well as military policy is really made by the rahbar (guide), i.e. Ali Khamenei, as well as the people around him, including the members of the Supreme National Security Council and the leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. I don’t think that Raisi’s death will really affect Iran’s policy in the short term.  The second part of the answer is yes, but perhaps in the midterm or longer term. This crisis, this disappearance, may create an opening for some to push through the ranks. It’s not clear what this could mean right now. These could be part of the younger generation of hardliners. But I have also read some analyses that say that it may make sense for Iran to open the political field a little, to save face in the elections that must take place within 50 days from the announcement of the president’s death. I’m going second that.  SWI: What will Iran look like in the next 50 days after Raisi?  C.S.: The Iranian regime will not change because of Raisi’s death as we just said. As such it is not yet clear how Khamenei will react to this crisis.  SWI: The model of Iranian democracy within which reformists have successfully collaborated with conservatives for power over the past 30 years has now ended. What are the internal political risks from the president’s death? Can we talk about a legitimacy crisis?  C.S.: Unless something very, very surprising happens, I don’t think there will be an uprising in the streets right away. Most people will use the coming election to signal their discontent by either simply not voting at all or writing into their ballot the name of somebody who was not allowed to run. Of course, the regime around Khamenei will very likely try to manipulate the election so that this will not show in the official results.   SWI: Can any significant changes be expected to Iran’s foreign policy towards Russia, Israel and the United States?  C.S.: I don’t think there will be any major change here either.  Since 2022 there has been a tighter relationship with Russia, which is an opportunistic move by both Iran and Russia. This relationship is important diplomatically, militarily and partly economically. The economic relationship with China is equally important. This takes the form of Iranian oil exports to China as well as massive Chinese financial and economic investments in Iran.  All this will not change – neither will Iran’s relationship with Israel and with the United States. SWI: In other words, Iran has a long way to go not only to establish contacts with the American administration but also to ensure that the situation in the Middle East does not escalate as in April when Iran attacked Israel?  C.S.: Iran’s Middle East policy, including its stance and influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, looks and is aggressive but at the same time serves the end of defending. It needs to be understood as part of a larger system with multiple actors.  Thus, structurally speaking, Israel, which is in a zero-sum game with Iran, is similarly aggressive with an eye to defending its interests.Also, the rules of the Iranian-Israeli game have changed but are now unclear after Iran’s unexpectedly forceful reaction to Israel’s attack on its embassy complex in Damascus in April. That is, Tehran, to maximise deterrence, has on purpose not clarified to which exact type of future Israeli attack it would again react by directly attacking Israel.SWI: Will the relationship between Switzerland and Iran change?  C.S.: Switzerland’s relationship to Iran is not going to drastically change. Compared to the situation some 20 or 30 years ago, Switzerland is less important as an intermediary between the United States and Iran.  They are simply too many other powers, including Oman, Qatar and Turkey, who are situated in the region itself and have an ingrained interest in fulfilling intermediary functions.  That role as an intermediary will not see a major revival. It will either stay the way it is, which is less impressive and less important than it used to be, or perhaps even decline.  Perhaps precisely because Western Europe is becoming less important to the Iranian regime, Iran may have a particular interest in keeping Switzerland on board. But this is unclear.  SWI: Are Iran and the US continuing contacts on lifting sanctions, as reported by Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs?  C.S.: Their relationship will not change. Both sides are aware that a confrontation can spiral out of control.  Neither side has a real interest in this.  A direct sustained American attack on Iran would further weaken a regime that already suffers from low popular support.  On their end, the Americans simply can’t afford to enter into a direct armed confrontation with Iran. They are of course militarily much stronger than Iran. But you never know how to get out of a war once you’ve entered one.  This is not something the Americans would want to do now. The question is whether US-led Western sanctions in place can be lifted, though I really don’t think that this is of major importance to Iran now.  After [former US President Donald] Trump took the US out of the nuclear deal, Iran made a strategic pivot to the east, meaning a much stronger relationship with China, with Russia and with some other countries, principally in Asia, but also in Africa. SWI: So would the only hope for change be after the departure of 85-year-old Khamenei? What might the power transition look like? The last one was in 1989. Would the transition be similar and present new faces, new spiritual leaders to the population? C.S.: It is still unclear who would replace Khamenei. We have reason to believe it might be his son, Mojtaba Khamenei. But it is also possible that it will be somebody else; it may be a bit too much of a monarchist move to anoint the son of the present rahbar as the new rahbar.  What we can say is that no reform-minded cleric could become the next rahbar.  But just as important, I think, is the question of who will play a key role in determining who will become the next rahbar and how that person will influence him and his politics? I think it’s probably a fair guess to say that within the Iranian Revolutionary Guard court there are people making sure the next leader will be somebody with whom they can work and who will accept and help protect their ideological and material interests in Iran.

250,UBS Private Event Draws Clients to Fast-Growing ESG Idea,"(Bloomberg) — UBS Group AG just held its first-ever conference dedicated to the ESG theme of biodiversity, signaling its ambitions to grow in a business area that Credit Suisse had targeted for expansion before its collapse.Judson Berkey, group head of engagement and regulatory strategy at UBS, said the goal is to figure out “what would help unblock finance” for deals focused on protecting natural capital.It’s not just about protecting assets from potential losses, but about identifying projects and deals that can make investors money, Berkey said in an interview before the London-based event. “There will be winners and losers,” he said.UBS says 250 institutional investors, corporate clients, family offices and practitioners attended the private event on Tuesday, which had previously been hosted by Credit Suisse in New York before the bank was taken over by its larger Swiss rival last year. Berkey says UBS had to turn away some clients because demand to attend was greater than the bank could accommodate. It’s now considering expanding the scope of future conferences, he said.Alistair Purdie, a biodiversity analyst at BloombergNEF who attended the event, said the guest list “highlights the speed at which biodiversity has climbed the finance agenda.”The world’s biggest banks are increasingly trying to get a foothold in the small but fast-growing market for biodiversity. Standard Chartered Plc has built a dedicated nature innovation hub, which coordinates with bankers across trading, advisory, financing and risk management functions. And JPMorgan Chase & Co., Lloyds Banking Group Plc and NatWest Group Plc are among the banks that have created dedicated senior roles to focus on the business area. The investment banking arm of UBS is now working on its first debt-for-nature swaps, a product that — in its current form — was pioneered by Credit Suisse. Such swaps bring in institutional investors to help countries refinance existing debt, and then put any savings toward environmental conservation programs.UBS’s philanthropic arm is exploring the use of carbon and biodiversity credits to help build a business model for marine-protected areas. And last year, the bank’s asset management arm launched a so-called natural-capital engagement program. The London conference coincides with the release later this week of a new study by UBS and nonprofit Planet Tracker, examining the kinds of strategies investors can deploy for the energy transition in a way that avoids inadvertently harming nature.“The transition journey has gotten very, very real, and it’s showing up with some real challenges and trade-offs,” said Lucy Thomas, head of sustainable investing at UBS Asset Management. Now is “the time to face into those and to get smarter on what the solutions could be to manage some of those complexities.”There’s a growing political and regulatory apparatus in place that makes it increasingly hard to ignore biodiversity, and banks and investors are keen to monetize the development. That includes identifying conflicts between the energy transition and the need to protect biodiversity. Mining is a key example of this tension, as extracting the raw materials needed to power the green transition threatens fragile ecosystems.Later this year, negotiators from almost 200 governments will gather in Cali, Colombia, to assess progress made against an international agreement signed in 2022 to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030 and source $700 billion per year to do so.   Private finance for nature has grown eleven-fold over the past four years to $102 billion, according to new data from the United Nations Environment Programme’s Finance Initiative. Alternative investments, traded debt and private equity drove that growth, as did innovation in financial instruments such as debt-for-nature swaps, new “nature-supportive” exchange-traded funds as well as biodiversity credits, UNEP FI said.“We are really encouraged by the fact that nature is coming online as a mainstream theme for the financial sector,” said Jessica Smith, UNEP FI’s nature finance lead. UBS’s Thomas says it’s increasingly clear that companies that have “made the investment to understand and put in place circularity, to understand their supply-chain transparency, and to understand those impacts are potentially better positioned from a market share perspective versus their peers.” For the finance industry, there’s now an “opportunity in identifying those who are doing this well, as well as those who aren’t thinking about that,” she said.(Adds BNEF comment in sixth paragraph.)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","June 12, 2024 - 19:25"
251,Europe’s small arms companies struggle for cash despite military spending boom,"By Michael Kahn and Jan LopatkaPRAGUE (Reuters) – Europe’s small and medium-sized defence companies are struggling to access finance needed to drive innovation and grow production lines even as demand soars due to the war in Ukraine and other conflicts, government officials, firms and experts say.A lack of access to public funding, red tape and banks’ reluctance to lend on fears of falling foul of environmental, social and governance regulations (ESG) are all hindering growth for smaller players in Europe’s defence sector, they say.This as global military expenditure hit an all time high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, up 6.8% from the prior year and the most since 2009, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.“Most of the problems that have existed in recent times for the defence and security industry have continued or deepened,” Defence and Security Industry Association of the Czech Republic Managing Director Jiri Hynek told Reuters. One small firearms maker told Reuters a cash crunch makes it difficult to sell products in Europe, or take part in government tenders. This makes it hard to expand and problematic from a cash-flow point of view, the company’s founder and chief executive said, declining to name his firm due to the sensitive nature of dealing with local banks.“It is very difficult to sell products to governments in Europe because I can’t get a down payment. If I want to supply the Czech government they will pay me 30 days after delivery so it makes things really expensive,” he said.Reuters spoke to around a dozen companies, government officials and experts in the defence sector, who all said European governments need to tackle how to improve access to financing for smaller companies.A 2024 European Commission report estimated small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU’s defence sector faced a debt financing gap of between 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) to 2 billion euros, crimping business growth, forcing firms to reduce operations and search for funding outside the European Union.Overly stringent and cautious interpretations of ESG criteria often result in exclusion policies by banks and investment funds in the EU, the report said, adding that providing clarity to the financial sector on how to address sustainability risks could improve access to financing. “In a sector defined by long development cycles and large capital requirements, a lack of funding can hamper a company’s ability to innovate, expand, or even maintain its current operations,” the report found.EU AND NATO GOVERNMENTS SEEK PRODUCTION BOOSTThe Czechs have launched a programme to co-finance small enterprises in the sector but a massive gap in venture capital money in Europe compared to the United States poses a major problem, Radka Konderlova, a Czech defence ministry official in charge of cooperation with industry, told Reuters.According to Dealroom.co, the United States has secured the majority of venture capital funding in defence and defence application startups among NATO allies with an 83% share since 2018.The U.S venture capital market is bigger and more mature than in Europe with specialised investors familiar with navigating complex defence deals and strict security regulations in the sector, the EU report said.Konderlova and others said the U.S. government’s hefty defence spending signals to markets that it will support projects, giving venture capital firms confidence to invest.She said one small tech dual-use company, which was selected by Lockheed Martin to participate in the development of an alternative manufacturing process for an F35 fighter jet component, had faced problems before the Czech government intervened with a letter to the bank’s chief executive officer.“When we find out about a problem we help companies on a case-by-case basis,” Konderlova said. “But we cannot work like this in every case. There is a need for a shift in the banks’ systemic approach.”The financing issues come as Ukraine struggles to access munitions it needs to repel a Russian advance in eastern Ukraine.A survey by the Czech industry association representing the nearly 200 defence companies in the country found that small and medium-sized companies reported deepening problems over the past year in everything from setting up bank loans to an inability to take payments from foreign clients.CHALLENGE TO ACCESS PUBLIC FUNDSFenella McGerty, a defence spending expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, said while big players have benefited from increased demand, companies further down the supply chain have found it more difficult to do so.Unlike bigger enterprises that tend to be listed on stock markets and benefit from exposure to larger global markets beyond Europe, smaller, more highly specialized companies can present a greater risk as they tend to be more component or system-based, she told Reuters.This makes it more difficult for lenders to not only establish ESG compliance but also gauge long-term market potential. It also potentially poses a reputational risk for banks as components are more difficult to track to determine whether they end up in the “wrong hands,” she said.Access to public funding is also a challenge.The EU report recommended providing EU-level funding to develop the bloc’s defence industrial capacities as well as removing restrictions on access to EU-funded financial instruments.Another chief executive of a small company sold a limited amount of rifles to Ukrainians with government approval and said his bank cancelled the private accounts of not only him but also his wife and children.“We always had problems but when we changed the name of our company to include ‘guns’ in it our troubles got much bigger,” he said.

252,Macron to visit Amazon rainforest with Lula on 3-day Brazil tour,"By Lisandra Paraguassu and Elizabeth PineauBRASILIA/PARIS (Reuters) – French President Emmanuel Macron, who criticized Brazil’s previous government for failing to protect the rainforest, will arrive on Tuesday in the Amazon at the start of a three-day visit to the South American country.Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will meet Macron in Belem, near the mouth of the Amazon River, where the two will visit conservation parks with sustainable development projects and meet with Indigenous leaders.“Lula wants to show Macron the complexity of the Amazon, which is not just a vast rainforest but also a place where 25 million people live,” Brazil’s top diplomat for Europe and North America, Maria Luisa Escorel, told reporters on Friday.She said the French government intends to fund sustainable development and programs to stop deforestation in the Amazon.Lula and Macron will discuss a common course to fight both climate change and poverty as Brazil prepares to host the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November and United Nations climate talks in Belem next year, both of which the French president will attend, the Elysée said in a briefing.A stalled trade agreement between the European Union and the South American common market Mercosur will not be on their agenda because it is not a bilateral matter, Brazilian and French officials said.Macron, who faces pressure from French farmers to kill the deal, has said he opposes the agreement that has been under negotiation for two decades.Brazil, in turn, is unhappy with EU legislation passed last year barring imports of coffee, beef, soy and other commodities if they are linked to recent deforestation, which Brazilian farmers consider a protectionist offensive.Despite those issues, relations between France and Brazil have recovered from a low point in 2019 when Macron led a wave of international pressure on then-President Jair Bolsonaro over fires raging in the Amazon. Bolsonaro accused Macron and other G7 countries of treating Brazil like “a colony”.“After a four-year eclipse and a virtual freeze in political relations between our two countries during Bolsonaro’s presidency, we are in the process of relaunching the bilateral relationship and the strategic partnership with Brazil,” a French presidential adviser said.On Wednesday, at the Itaguai shipyard outside Rio, Macron and Lula will launch the third Scorpene-class diesel-powered submarine built in Brazil with French technology, part of a $10 billion program that will build Brazil’s first nuclear-powered submarine at the end of the decade.The program is a partnership with France’s state-run Naval Group in which the Thales defense group has a 35% stake.Macron will meet business executives in Sao Paulo on Wednesday afternoon and make a state visit to Brasilia on Thursday, meeting again with Lula and the head of the Senate.","March 25, 2024 - 17:07"
253,COP28 clashes over fossil fuel phase-out after OPEC pushback,"By Kate Abnett, Valerie Volcovici and Yousef SabaDUBAI (Reuters) -Some countries are resisting a proposed pledge to phase-out fossil fuels in a COP28 climate deal, jeopardising attempts for U.N. climate talks to deliver a hard commitment for the first time in 30 years on ending the use of oil and gas.Observers in the negotiations said Saudi Arabia and Russia were among countries insisting that the summit in Dubai focus only on reducing climate pollution – with no mention of the fossil fuels causing it.Earlier this week, the oil producer group OPEC sent a letter urging its members and allies to reject any mention of fossil fuels in the final summit deal. The letter warned that “undue and disproportionate pressure against fossil fuels may reach a tipping point” in the talks.In a statement to Reuters, OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais declined to comment on the letter, but said OPEC wanted to keep the summit’s focus on reducing climate-warming emissions, and away from their main sources like oil and gas.“The world requires major investments in all energies, including hydrocarbons,” he said. “Energy transitions must be just, fair and inclusive.”It was the first time OPEC’s Secretariat has intervened in the U.N. climate talks with such a letter.“It indicates a whiff of panic,” said Alden Meyer of think-tank E3G.Saudi Arabia is the top producer in OPEC and the de facto leader of the organization. Russia is a member of the so-called OPEC+ group.By insisting on focusing on emissions rather than fossil fuels, the two countries appeared to be leaning on the promise of expensive carbon capture technology, which the U.N. climate science panel says cannot take the place of reducing fossil fuel use worldwide.On the other side, at least 80 countries including the United States, European Union and many poor, climate-vulnerable nations are demanding that a COP28 deal call clearly for an eventual end to fossil fuel use.Other countries including India and China have not explicitly endorsed a fossil fuel phase-out at COP28, but have backed a popular call for boosting renewable energy.Ireland’s former president, Mary Robinson, who heads a group of former world leaders known as the Elders, said the letter showed OPEC was “worried” about the trajectory of the COP28 talks.“Russia and Saudi Arabia are on the wrong side of this and will probably be pushing hard,” Robinson said. “We really have to make sure that the tipping point tips the right way.”Diplomatic grievances were also aired at the podium on Saturday.A Russia representative said in a speech that Moscow was looking into whether some of the roughly $300 billion in gold reserves frozen by the West after Russia invaded Ukraine could be used for a climate damage fund for developing countries.Meanwhile, China complained about what it said was unacceptable talk about Taiwan’s participation in the talks. And a Palestinian representative denounced Israel’s war in Gaza, saying the conflict made it difficult to focus on climate change efforts.‘CRITICAL STAGE’With the summit’s scheduled to end on Tuesday, government ministers from the nearly 200 countries at the Dubai summit have joined in trying to resolve the fossil fuel impasse.Climate-vulnerable countries said a rejection of a fossil fuel mention at COP28 would threaten the entire world.“Nothing puts the prosperity and future of all people on earth, including all of the citizens of OPEC countries, at greater risk than fossil fuels,” said Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege in a statement.The Marshall Islands, which faces inundation from climate-driven sea level rise, currently chairs the High Ambition Coalition group of nations pushing for stronger emissions-cutting targets and policies.To meet the global goal of holding climate warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures, the coalition “is pushing for a phase out of fossil fuels, which are at the root of this crisis,” she said. “1.5 is not negotiable, and that means an end to fossil fuels.”The latest version of the negotiating text, released Friday, shows countries were still considering a range of options – from agreeing to a “phase out of fossil fuels in line with best available science”, to phasing out “unabated fossil fuels”, to including no mention at all.Germany’s climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said counties were “moving into the critical stage of negotiations”.“It is time for all countries to remember what is at stake,” she said. “I am concerned that not all are constructively engaging.”Asked about the OPEC letter, COP28 Director General Majid Al Suwaidi avoided the term “fossil fuels” but said the United Arab Emirates, as president of the summit, wanted a deal to get the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 C.“Our COP president … clearly wants to see an outcome that is as ambitious as possible, and we believe we are going to deliver it,” he told a news conference.Speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, Samoa’s environment minister, Cedric Schuster, worried that this year’s talks were getting bogged down by disputes.“We are extremely concerned about the pace of negotiations given the limited time we have left here in Dubai,” he told the summit from the main stage on Saturday.“A target for renewables cannot be a substitute for a stronger commitment to fossil fuel phase-out and an end to fossil fuel subsidies,” he said. “COP28 needs to deliver both.”Azerbaijan looks set to host next year’s COP29 climate change summit after winning backing from other Eastern European nations, unblocking a geopolitical deadlock over the next global gathering to address climate change.For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here.(Reporting by Kate Abnett, Valerie Volcovici, Yousef Saba, David Stanway, Simon Jessop, Elizabeth Piper and William James; Editing by Katy Daigle, William Mallard and David Evans)","December 9, 2023 - 13:26"
254,Stocks Halt Rebound as Oil Hits $80 on War Angst: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Stocks struggled for direction ahead of US inflation data, with the latest geopolitical developments curbing the appetite for risk.Just a week after the panic selling that shook trading around the globe, the S&P 500 was flat. With Wall Street still reeling from last Monday’s wild gyrations, many investors are refraining from making big bets as they await more signals about the health of the world’s largest economy. Oil hit $80 and bonds gained as the US believes an Iranian attack against Israel is increasingly likely.To Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management, it’s a good time for investors to “take stock” of how far key markets have moved.“Volatility could return this week,” she said. “If inflation is too low, this may heighten concerns that the US may be heading for a recession. If inflation is too high, it could encourage fears that the Federal Reserve may be unable to cut rates quickly enough to protect the economy. Geopolitical risks also remain elevated.”The S&P 500 hovered around 5,345. Most major groups fell, though tech, energy and utilities gained. The Russell 2000 of small caps extended its August slide to 8.5%. The Cboe Volatility Index — the VIX — edged mildly higher — after an unprecedented spike last week.Cboe Global Markets Inc. acknowledged that thin trading premarket played a role in the VIX’s violent move last Monday — but said its surge was justified by the mounting angst over the contagion risk emanating from a crash in Japanese currency and stocks, which led to the yen carry-trade unwinding.“When the world feels uneasy, people feel less inclined to take risks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “But fear can be a healthy dynamic for a market that thrives on clearing low hurdles. When it turns out that bad news isn’t as bad as people think, they pile back in.”Subscribe to the Bloomberg Surveillance podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.To Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services, following past volatility shocks, we tend to see wide swings in both directions, and the repair process typically takes time.“Indeed, after such a sharp move down, there tends to be a battle between fear and greed,” Lerner said. “There is fear of more downside, which causes some investors to continue to sell on any bounce, and then greed on the other side, where those investors who were waiting for a pullback wade in.”Notably, to gain further confidence, investors will be waiting for some of the higher profile reports/events like Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole and Nvidia Corp.’s results this month. In the interim, each economic report will likely be overly scrutinized, he said.US inflation probably picked up modestly in July, but not enough to derail the Federal Reserve from a widely anticipated interest-rate cut next month.“Investors will be looking for the numbers to land in a sweet spot,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.After last week’s turmoil, markets will be focused on Wednesday’s consumer price index to see if the Fed will have a freer or more constrained hand in refocusing on the labor market and front-loading rate cuts sufficiently to secure a “soft landing,” according to Krishna Guha at Evercore.“But do not panic if CPI is on the hotter side,” Guha noted. “This is now a labor-data first Fed, not an inflation-data first Fed, that is less data-point dependent, more forward-looking. We think if coming labor data stays soft, the Fed will still be forward-leaning on cuts.”During the most-recent turmoil, investors slashed equity allocations at the sharpest pace since the onset of the pandemic, according to Deutsche Bank AG. An analysis of previous growth scares suggests that stock correlations and volatility will “will only gradually recede back to ‘normal,’” said Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin.If economic worries abate, “then the recent selloff represents an opportunity to buy stocks with healthy fundamentals at valuation discounts,” he wrote.Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson says a double whammy of economic uncertainty and a weak period for corporate earnings forecasts is likely to cap stock market gains.The strategist — among the most notable bearish voices on US equities until last year — said he expects the S&P 500 to trade in a range of 5,000 to 5,400 points as macroeconomic data flash no clear signals over the short term.The risk-reward for stock markets remains mixed over the summer months against the backdrop of weakening business activity and negative earnings revisions, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka.“Fed will start cutting, but this might not drive a sustained leg higher, as the cuts might be seen as reactive, and behind the curve,” they wrote.Investors will have a brief window to buy the dip in US stocks at the end of this month as selling pressure from systematic funds eases while companies boost share buybacks, according to Scott Rubner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. More near-term dips can’t be excluded if activity data surprise negatively, but investors should buy stocks on weakness as fundamentals are still supportive of risk assets, HSBC strategists say.The team led by Max Kettner sees signs of stabilization after a significant volatility shock, with focus returning to fundamentals as the dust settles.At least one indicator suggests that last Monday’s drama looks more like a minor meltdown than a harbinger of worse things to come.Consider the Cboe Volatility Index and the option-adjusted spread on the Bloomberg US Corporate Bond Index. Based on a long-term relationship between the two, the VIX’s close near 39 a week ago was supposed to correspond to a reading of 3.5% in corporate bond spreads. Yet they ended much lower, near 1.32%. The mismatch between the two suggests the recent downdraft was technical and not indicative of economic doom, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Christopher Cain and Michael Casper. In fact, such abnormal disconnects in the past have led to above-average returns for stocks over the next three-to-six months.Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report says he doesn’t think fundamentals have deteriorated enough to warrant de-risking and reducing equity or risk exposure — but he also wants to caution against dismissing the recent uptick in volatility.“Much of what I read over the weekend characterized this recent volatility as just a typical pullback in an upward-trending market,” Essaye. “Because of that, I continue to advocate for defensive sector exposure and and minimum volatility funds.”Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from John Viljoen and Matthew Burgess.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","August 12, 2024 - 22:53"
255,"Africa Floods Affect 4 Million People, Deepen Food Crisis","(Bloomberg) — Floods across 14 central and West African nations have affected at least 4 million people — rendering many of them homeless — killed about 1,000 and are devastating crops in a region that’s already short of food and plagued by insecurity.The heavy rains in the western half of the semi-arid Sahel zone, which borders the southern Sahara Desert from Africa’s west to east coasts, are likely to persist, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. Researchers blame this year’s deluge — which coincides with a crucial crop season — on global warming, saying that rising temperatures are resulting in the air storing more water vapor.A large part of the Sahara will get more than 500% of its normal September rainfall, according to Severe Weather Europe, a blog that publishes meteorological forecasts. The International Rescue Group described the floods across the region as the worst in 30 years and estimates from University of California, Santa Barbara’s Climate Hazards Center show large stretches of Mali received the highest rainfall on record for the first 10 days of September. Parts of Niger and Chad did too. “The dramatic flooding that we’re currently seeing in West Africa coincides with the monsoon season,” said Benjamin Sultan, a researcher at the French government’s Research Institute for Sustainable Development who’s working on climate change with a focus on West Africa. “It’s becoming more and more intense every year, causing deadly floods as we’re seeing in the Sahel.”The floods are hitting a region that’s among the least-prepared globally for climate-related disasters, with little money available to buffer infrastructure against adverse weather. Chad ranks last in an index of 187 countries assessed by the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative for climate-change vulnerability and of the countries affected by the floods five rank in the bottom 10.Record HungerIn Chad, the floods have swept across almost the entire country, resulting in at least 340 deaths and rendering 1.5 million homeless, according to the government. They’ve destroyed about 160,000 dwellings, submerged 260,000 hectares (642,470 acres) of land and drowned 60,000 livestock. “With flooded farmland and drowned livestock, there will be a lot less food available now and in the future in a country where 3.4 million people already face acute hunger – the highest level of food insecurity ever recorded in Chad,” Jens Laerke, a United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs spokesman, said in a briefing last week.Neighboring Niger is also hard-hit — with 400,000 made homeless and 273 killed — while Mali has recorded 62 deaths and 345,000 people are without shelter, according to the governments and aid groups working in the two nations. Food prices are rising in Niger as transport routes to markets become impassable.“I’ve never seen rains like this,” said Mamadou Tidiani, a farmer with seven children in Niger’s Agadez region. “It’s too soon to say how much of the harvest that was destroyed, but I fear it will be bad.”Northern Nigeria also hasn’t been spared from floods, partly caused by a dam bursting near the town of Maiduguri, displacing more than 610,000 and killing 201, according to the World Health Organization. Half of the city of more than a million people is under water, according to the United Nations’ World Food Programme.Sign up here for the twice-weekly Next Africa newsletterAcross the region 55 million people are deemed food insecure, a fourfold increase from five years ago, the WFP said in a statement.“Hunger looms large,” said the organization, which is running emergency kitchens in Maiduguri and providing emergency food in Chad, Liberia, Mali and Niger.Tahir Hamid Nguilin, Chad’s finance minister and chairman of the flooding prevention committee, has said the situation is unprecedented, especially in the northern part of the country, which is largely desert. The floods have affected production of millet, corn, sorghum and rice. Further south, in Cameroon, 11 people have died and close to 200,000 have been displaced by the floods, which have also destroyed 103,000 hectares of farmland, according to the government. The government is relocating people to safer areas and arranging for students to continue studying after 198 schools were inundated and a major bridge damaged. Some cocoa plantations have been flooded and roads from farms to markets aren’t usable.“This year is exceptional. Since I was a child I haven’t seen flooding like this. We believe it’s climate change,” said Mahamane Hamza, a 62-year-old agronomist in Niger’s western Tahoua region. “It’s destroyed tens of thousands of hectares of farmland.”The wet weather in western Africa coincides with torrential rains in European nations including Poland, Austria and Germany that have left at least 18 people dead.–With assistance from Emele Onu, Paul Richardson, Ana Monteiro, Moses Mozart Dzawu and Diakaridia Dembele.(Updates with extent of floods in first paragraph.)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","September 17, 2024 - 13:36"

The development department in the US currently has around 2000 jobs. In addition to Basel, the US will remain an important development location for Novartis.+Swiss pharma’s big bet on SloveniaAt the same time, Novartis has announced that it will create new development positions in Basel and elsewhere. “With this anticipated job reduction in Switzerland and the US and the parallel creation of positions in our established centres over the next two to three years, we expect a net reduction of 1% to 2% in the global development organisation, which currently has over 12,500 employees,” the statement continues.According to Novartis, this reorganisation has become necessary as a result of the group’s transformation over the past few years. The spin-off of the generics division Sandoz last October was the final step in the transition to a focussed pharmaceutical group with five core therapeutic areas.Against this background, Novartis has analysed its development organisation and is now planning the corresponding changes. The aim is to “optimise resources and ways of working in development in a sustainable global operating model to support priority programmes and core activities.”+Swiss trade deal: Is India changing its tune on pharma patents?After the group cut 8,000 of its then total of 108,000 jobs worldwide just two years ago, the current round concerns the area responsible for tasks such as regulatory affairs and technical research and development. The research organisation (Biomedical Research) is not affected by the measures.As Novartis emphasises, not only will jobs be cut, but new ones will also be created. In Basel alone, the Development department will therefore create up to 40 new positions in 2024 to support the acquisition of Chinook, the licence agreement with Argo Biopharma and the development of radioligand therapy as well as the capacities for x-RNA at Technical Research and Development.After Switzerland had accounted for around 10% to 11% of the global workforce in recent years, the Swiss share is now over 13% since the Sandoz spin-off. “We expect the Swiss share of the global workforce to remain at just under 13% after the adjustments in Development.”The group is aware of the impact of the planned changes on its employees and will ensure that it fulfils all requirements regarding consultation and implementation, Novartis added.The social plan includes appropriate severance payments, job placement, support from a career centre, best placement and development activities, as well as other measures that may also take into account the circumstances of associates. The aim of these measures is to improve the internal and external employment opportunities of associates.Adapted from German by DeepL/amvaSign up to get daily news from Switzerland, directly in your inbox.","April 10, 2024 - 09:35"
257,Gold: Can the UAE outshine Switzerland?,"Switzerland sits at the heart of Europe and has for decades been the dominant player in the global gold industry both in terms of refining capacity and trading. But the UAE, which lies at the crossroads of the West and an increasingly affluent East, is threatening that supremacy, having built its position quietly over the past two decades. These dramatically different worlds are intertwined yet also increasingly competitive. The UAE, particularly Dubai, is on the rise as an international gold hub. Since 2012, it has leveraged its strategic location, modern infrastructure, and business-friendly policies to attract global players. While Switzerland offers a well-established financial system and an orderly, regulated market, the UAE provides a dynamic and forward-looking environment with a strong emphasis on innovation – innovation in architecture, digital technology and the business environment. Sanctions on Russia over its war against Ukraine have also helped shift global gold trading to Dubai and Hong Kong.How much of a threat is the UAE to Switzerland?  “It depends on how you look at the gold sector and the roles that the countries play,” says Australia-based gold expert Marcena Hunter. “The UAE is already a major gold transit hub. Dubai already imports and exports significant amounts of gold, including to Switzerland. In some ways, you can argue that Dubai is already bigger than Switzerland, especially in relation to [gold imports from] artisanal and small-scale mining.”   The Swiss tend to stick to sourcing gold from industrial mines across the world. The UAE, on the other hand, snaps up gold from artisanal small-scale operations in sub-Saharan-Africa, Latin America and South Asia. Switzerland has consistently been the world’s leading gold importing and exporting country in value terms, but the UAE’s growing share means it’s now among the top five.The Alpine nation remains the pre-eminent choice for those seeking precision and reliability in gold transactions. Swiss banks and refiners trumpet their adherence to strict regulations and are increasingly putting emphasis on ethical sourcing. Members of the Swiss Association of Precious Metals Manufacturers and Traders even stopped sourcing gold from Dubai. Last year Valcambi, the country’s largest refinery, decided to resign from the association arguing “irreconcilable differences”. The association coordinates communication and lobbying on behalf of the Swiss gold sector and takes pride in its code of conduct.+ The dark secrets of Valcambi, Switzerland’s largest refineryThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, formally identified the UAE in June 2022 as a jurisdiction subject to increased monitoring due to perceived deficiencies in the effectiveness of its efforts to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Problematic transactions in the gold sector were a major reason for its decision to add the country to its grey list.“Dubai is an important market and international precious metal business hub,” says Christoph Wild, former CEO of Swiss refinery Argor-Heraeus and president of the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Traders of Precious Metals. “It will be even more important in the future,” he said, pointing to its strategic location, rapid infrastructure development and business-friendly environment along with the potential for growth in financial services.“They [the UAE] are taking good steps towards more sustainability and transparency,” he said. “That’s the right way to go. But time is not mature now to close our eyes and take all material coming from Dubai.”It has been established that a large amount of gold transiting through Dubai comes from Africa and from illegal, criminal, conflict zones, Wild says. “We all know that when gold is melted together you lose the identity. If we are not clear on where the gold comes from then don’t touch it. That’s not to say that all players in the UAE are bad. There are good players, bad players, and crystal-clear players when it comes to due diligence.”Others point out that while the UAE remains a destination for unlicensed gold mining, it has been taking steps to strengthen its regulatory regime. “There are other places that are used in the same way; or abused,” notes Hunter, who is the thematic lead on extractives at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, a civil society organisation focused on illicit economies. “We are seeing indications that other destinations are increasingly exploited to launder gold. Also, markets such as Switzerland or the UK are not necessarily clean or guilt-free as long as they continue to import large amounts of gold from jurisdictions where gold is known to be laundered.”Indeed, the UAE’s main export to Switzerland is gold. Shipments from the Arab nation amounted to CHF7.9 billion ($9.16 billion) in 2022, according to the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security. Problematic gold – be it from Africa’s conflict zones or dodgers of Western sanctions on Russia – can easily flow to Switzerland via the UAE, according to experts.Trade data show Russia and Mali were the two top sources of UAE gold imports in 2022 in terms of volume and value. Russia was the noteworthy newcomer, a result of sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine curtailed exports to Western markets. Local armed groups in several conflict-hit regions of Africa have used the gold trade to finance their activities for decades. The security concern for Western nations are players like Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State and Russia’s mercenary Wagner group.Dubai hosted its 11th annual Precious Metals Conference in November. The event, born out of the global financial crisis in 2008, drew a wide array of gold industry players, from regulators and experts, to bankers, traders, refiners, and even sanctioned individuals including Alain Goetz, who was punished by the European Union for dealing in conflict gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo.In contrast to Western conferences, Russians came in high enough numbers to warrant their own table and discussed headaches such as export tariffs and sanctions with existing and potential partners in China. While presenters talked due diligence, a pair of delegates from Siberia wondered if their request to publicly present a falcon carved from mammoth marble to the host would be accepted. Others sought to sell Sudanese gold, which has also been linked to conflict finance.The event portrayed Dubai as the heart of an intensifying gold trade that is increasingly shifting east.“We cannot ignore the fact that central banks accumulated gold at the fastest pace on record in the first two months of 2023, totaling 125 tonnes,” DMCC Chairman Ahmed Bin Sulayem said in his welcome remarks to the conference. “From India to Russia, central banks collectively bought 800 tonnes over the past 12 months – up 14% on the previous year. And all signs show we should expect another colossal year of gold buying in 2024, with increased volatility, ongoing inflation, and de-dollarisation in global financial markets.”The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a free-trade zone, has been key to the UAE’s rise in the global gold market. It houses major refineries such as SAM Precious Metals, Al-Etihad and Emirates Gold. The latter was suspended from the Good Delivery lists of approved refiners by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and the UAE’s equivalent over laundering concerns – to the horror of its recently appointed Swiss CEO, Daniele Provenzale, who attended the conference but declined an interview request.Companies and individuals involved in the gold industry are as keen on keeping a low profile in the UAE as they are in Switzerland. Sulayem declined to be interviewed by SWI swissinfo.ch during or after the event and UAE refineries did not respond to verbal and written requests for site visits. But one refinery hosted Valcambi representatives on the same week of the Dubai gold conference, according to a source familiar with the matter. The conference did have other Swiss executives in attendance as well as World Gold Council, OECD and LBMA representatives keen to see what progress the UAE has made amid efforts to get off the FATF grey list.In 2021, the UAE unveiled its own Good Delivery Standard, which built on the Dubai Good Delivery Standard and, like its LBMA equivalent, comprises a set of rules governing settlement and trade in gold. It imposes annual audits on gold sector actors to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and responsible sourcing laws. “In two years, this place will be as clean as Singapore,” predicts Lars Johansson, an independent advisor at Secure Supply Chains, a Switzerland-based consultancy, who regularly attends the event. “This is bad news for Switzerland.”Andrew Naylor, head of Middle East and public policy at the World Gold Council, acknowledges the potential danger to Switzerland’s dominance, although does not see it as a zero-sum game because the two countries service different parts of the market. “Where the threat might be is on the refining side,” he says.The Arab nation has come a long way since Swiss citizen Mohamad Shakarchi opened Emirates Gold, a refinery and mint, in Dubai in 1992. While Switzerland is still home to five of the largest and most important refineries in the world, numerically the UAE has twice as many, although they are much smaller. In 2022, it signed a trade agreement with India, the world’s second-largest gold jewellery consumer after China, and a key customer for Swiss refineries.But the Alpine nation still has an edge in other areas. Switzerland, Naylor points out, remains a major custody center providing vaulting services to high-net-worth individuals and institutions. The UAE is not a meaningful player in this field. Both countries are relatively small players in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.Dubai is also absent from the investment space, Naylor notes. Globally, over 3,000 tons of gold are held in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), investment products that follow an index, commodity, bond, or a mix of products. About half of the total is held in US-domiciled ETFs. London follows with 600 tons, then Germany and Switzerland with about 340 each, while the UAE doesn’t even appear in the top 20.The UAE’s efforts to tighten regulations on the gold and precious stones industry have been recognised as progress by the FATF. Many in the business also point out that gold is gold, and that so-called “bad gold” will always find a market – Turkey, India, China and Russia remain important players while not exactly shining examples of due diligence. Yet Switzerland, too, is tightening its regulations and banking on its reputation to help maintain its edge over the UAE and other refining hubs.“There’s always been this debate: is due diligence a risk or an advantage in terms of future market share?” extractive industries expert and OECD advisor Louis Marechal told SWI swissinfo.ch. “We would always argue that it’s actually to your advantage because it’s an increasing requirement from markets and from regulators. I do believe Swiss refiners and LBMA refiners in general are more responsible and accountable than a number of other refiners elsewhere in the world.”The UAE’s growing influence in the world gold market has yet to fundamentally threaten Switzerland’s dominance. Swiss refineries are accredited by the LBMA and included on its Good Delivery list while none of the UAE refineries have made it onto the list, which means they cannot supply gold to the London market. But that could change if the UAE’s efforts at stronger regulation bear fruit – its tightened gold import rules came into effect in January 2023 and the industry is watching closely to see whether stronger regulation is backed by robust enforcement.“It’s still early days,” says Sakhila Mirza, deputy CEO of the LBMA. “Steps are being taken [by the UAE] in the right direction on responsible sourcing. It’s now a matter of understanding the impact and what this means for UAE exposure to international markets.”Edited by Nerys Avery/vm","January 31, 2024 - 09:00"
258,"Putin ally attends Raisi commemorations, delivers message of support from Moscow","MOSCOW (Reuters) – A senior ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin attended commemorations in Tehran for the late President Ebrahim Raisi on Wednesday and passed on a message of support for the Iranian leadership from the Kremlin chief.Russia and Iran have developed close ties in recent years, pushing against what they see as pernicious U.S. foreign policy in an effort to establish what they say would be a fairer multipolar world order.Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash on Sunday appeared to shock Moscow, which quickly offered its condolences and support.Putin sent Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of Russia’s State Duma lower house of parliament and a close ally, to Raisi’s commemorations, the Duma said in a statement.It said he had met interim president Mohammad Mokhber and passed on a message from Putin “to the leadership and people of Iran.”“Russia mourns together with Iran. We will preserve the bright memory of President Raisi as an outstanding politician, a true patriot of his country, and as a true friend,” the message said.“The President of Russia is convinced that the Islamic Republic will steadfastly overcome all its trials and continue its confident movement along the path of sustainable national development and strengthening state sovereignty.”","May 22, 2024 - 15:54"
259,Britain aims for faster investment decisions on new nuclear projects,"By Nina ChestneyLONDON (Reuters) – The British government aims to speed up action on new nuclear projects by introducing a time frame requiring an investment decision every five years from 2030 to 2044 and will also explore the potential of a new large-scale nuclear plant, it said on Thursday.Britain aims to have up to 24 GW of nuclear capacity by mid-century, up from 6 GW today, which could meet around a quarter of the country’s forecast electricity demand.To help achieve this, the government wants to secure investment decisions to deliver 3-7 GW of new nuclear power every five years from 2030-2044 and develop new regulation to speed up the deployment of new plants.The share of nuclear energy in Britain’s electricity generation has fallen to around 15% from 27% in the 1990s as older plants have been decommissioned and plants are taking time to build.Much of the UK nuclear fleet is nearing the end of its scheduled lifespan even though EDF Energy said this week it aims to extend the lives of its reactors.EDF Energy’s new 3.2 GW Hinkley Point C plant in south-west England is not expected to come online until at least 2027. Another 3.2 GW planned plant – Sizewell C in south-east England – has not yet had a final investment decision (FID).The government and developer EDF Energy started a process last year to bring private equity investment into the project but EDF said a sustainable commercial model is needed for FID.Nevertheless, the government said it would be “challenging” to meet its nuclear goals without at least the option of further large-scale projects.“We are committed to exploring a further large-scale reactor project beyond Sizewell C. We will set out timelines and process by the end of this Parliament, subject to a Sizewell C FID,” the department for energy security and net zero said in its civil nuclear roadmap.Small-modular nuclear reactors, which can be made in factories with lower costs and faster construction will also help in meeting the 24 GW goal. The government launched a competition last year to develop them by the 2030s.Some environmental groups were critical of the goverment’s plans to expand nuclear power, which is seen as a way to cut fossil fuel emissions.“Every few months the government makes a grandiose public announcement about future nuclear in the hope that a major investor will believe the hype and step up to fund this 20th century technology,” said Doug Parr, Chief Scientist for Greenpeace UK.The government also said it wants to remove any remaining Russian fuel and uranium supply to Britain by 2030 and build a disposal facility which will accommodate nuclear waste of up to 24 GW in capacity.","January 11, 2024 - 11:26"
260,The United Nations’ Pact for the Future: from negotiation to action?,"Also in New York the following week, we heard state leaders one after the other at the General Assembly podium, and saw them rushing through corridors with their bodyguards and delegations to bilateral meetings and events. Would the Summit and adopted texts deliver on the UN Secretary General’s plea, in a world “heading off the rails” for “tough decisions to get back on track” ?In a situation plagued by conflicts and global risks on the planet and in outer space, one could feed in skepticism about the UN and multilateralism. However, it is worth risking to argue that negotiating these documents was important, and that much depends on what is done next to turn them into concrete actions.For the negotiator used to eleventh-hour uncertainty in multilateral negotiations, it is an achievement that these arduous intergovernmental negotiations yielded result. Each document was the result of separate negotiations with all States present through several rounds behind closed doors, not to mention consultations with civil society and other stakeholders.For weeks, we saw attempts to seal an agreement by “silence procedure”. But silence was broken just a few days before the Summit: it is enough for one of the 193 States to object, for the deal to break through.Close to the finish line, high level officials intervened to break the deadlock, while the Secretary-General faced the worst scenario: a Summit without results and a multilateral system where States could no longer even agree on a text. Anticipating that the Russian Federation would present an amendment from the General Assembly, the Secretary-General had prepared different speeches depending on whether the pact was adopted or not.At the opening of the summit, the tension in the room was palpable. Reacting to the Russian Federation amendment, the African Group tabled a “no-action motion” visibly in support of General Assembly’s President Yang (Cameroon). Seconded by Mexico, the “no-action motion” was adopted with 143 “yes”, 15 “no”, and seven “abstentions”. Immediately after, the Pact was adopted, technically, “by consensus”.Did the Pact’s adoption just save the United Nations from its death knell? It remains to be seen whether the Summit allows the UN to “make a new beginning for multilateralism”, as States pledged in the Pact. Guterres sharply stated: “It’s not just a matter of agreeing – it’s also a matter of acting. Today, I challenge you to take action”. Does the negotiated text come with sufficient commitment and is it ambitious enough to translate into concrete action? Some are prompt to answer the negative: legally, the Pact is no more binding than any General Assembly resolution; its content does not meet the urgency and scale of the global challenges.True, but the presence of a very large number of Heads of States and governments can be seen as a collective political commitment. Referring to the ups and downs leading up to adoption, Swiss President Viola Amherd stated

: “Perhaps because of these difficulties, the Pact is proving to be an important and clear signal of commitment to the multilateral system”.Some, like President da Silva of Brazil

, recalled past reforms carried out under Secretary-General Kofi Annan, such as the establishment of a Human Rights Council in Geneva, while other ideas failed to materialise. “The Pact for the Future shows us the direction to follow” in the face of new risks and opportunities, said da Silva, warning: “it will require an enormous negotiation effort (…) We cannot wait for another global tragedy, like the Second World War, to build a new global governance on its ruins.”As for content, the Pact’s provisions can only be ambitious if implemented.

. Depending on the issues, the Pact is more or less ambitious in its 56 “actions” under five headings : sustainable development and financing for development; international peace and security; science, technology, innovation and digital cooperation; young people and future generations; transforming global governance.Clearly, the Pact does not reform the Security Council, described by Guterres as “outdated”; the Council’s meetings a few meters away failing to act on the deteriorating situation in the Middle East do not belie this. But while the Zero draft
External link
only had a placeholder on this, the adopted text refers to the negotiations underway on the “scope and use” of the veto, and the necessary enlargement of the Council. Significantly, all States agreed to “redress the historical injustice against Africa as a priority” and to improve the representation of other regions: Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.Nor does the Pact reform the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. But it does engage States as they underscored the “need to enhance the representation and voice of developing countries in global economic decision-making, norm-setting and global economic governance”. Pressure is mounting, with notably the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) developing alternative financial institutions. Efforts are due to be pursued in the run up to the International Conference on Financing for Development in Spain, and the World Summit on Social Development in Qatar, both in 2025.These are long overdue reforms since the now 193-member UN was founded by only 51 members, with the rest of the world under colonial rule. Paving the way for another long overdue change, the Pact points to “the regrettable fact that there has never been a woman Secretary-General”. And Guterres challenged States: “gender inequality is on full display in this very Hall. Less than 10 per cent of speakers during this week’s General Debate are women.”In the field of technology, States committed, among others, to “enhance international governance of artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity”, and called on the private sector to apply the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights

just before the Summit, Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed praised the architect of the Summit, Under-Secretary-General Guy Ryder, for securing segments dedicated to youth participation. It spoke probably more to the issue than the Declaration’s rather vague language where States “take note of the Secretary-General’s proposal to appoint a Special Envoy for Future Generations”.

From the busy UN and a Manhatan jammed with police escorts, we headed to Harlem for a reality check: none of the African Americans randomly approached seemed to have heard of the Summit and the Pact; one of them, Lyndell, asked: “is it a Pact for the Heads of States or for the people?”It is now up to each and every one of us, for the civil society Coalition for the UN We Need

261,"‘Zombie’ hurricane John comes back to life, lashing Mexico’s Pacific coast","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Hurricane John strengthened once again on Thursday as it hurled rain at Mexico’s southwestern coast dotted with ports and tourist hotspots, an area already soaked by the slow-moving storm system over the past several days.John has churned menacingly near the stretch of coastline since Monday, weakening and strengthening again as it impacted major cargo ports, temporarily shutting local airports as well as claiming at least five lives, mostly due to mudslides.AccuWeather meteorologist Jesse Ferrell referred to John as a “zombie” storm – a term that refers to systems that dissipate before strengthening back into a storm, first coined by the U.S. National Weather Service in 2020 when the remnants of storm Paulette regenerated near the Azores after striking Bermuda.In 2004, Hurricane Ivan, which lasted close to an entire month, smashed the Caribbean before dissipating and coming back to life to strike the United States. Ivan caused some $26 billion in damages for that year.Christopher Rozoff, atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said John was slow-moving and had no large-scale steering forces moving it elsewhere.This, Rozoff said, made it “prone to take a disastrous path back over sea to reintensify and further torment the Mexican coast with extreme rainfall.”On Thursday evening, John was packing maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (121 kph) and crawling northwest just off the coast of Mexico’s Michoacan state, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory.The Miami-based center expects the storm will remain a hurricane as it moves along the coast Thursday evening, possibly moving inland while further drenching the area through at least Saturday.A hurricane warning is in effect for much of Michoacan’s coastline and parts of bordering Guerrero, which John hit earlier in the week in a strike that uprooted trees, knocked out power to tens of thousands and triggered deadly landslides that crushed houses.Guerrero state Governor Evelyn Salgado on Thursday morning urged residents to take all precautions, a day after a rising tide battered beach-front restaurants in Acapulco, one of the state’s top resort areas, and rains flooded nearby roads.Acapulco is still recovering from major destruction caused by Hurricane Otis last year.“This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides,” it warned.AccuWeather lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva said that both John and Otis had strengthened rapidly due to the warm sea temperatures, with some areas where John developed nearing 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit), providing storms with more fuel.Rowan University meteorologist Andra Garner said the warm waters had likely helped John reform after its first landfall.Moving into the future, added DaSilva, it is “very likely” we will see warmer sea surface temperatures, which “could lead to more episodes of rapid intensification as we look ahead.”(Reporting by David Alire Garcia, Raul Cortes and Sarah Morland; Editing by Aurora Ellis and Stephen Coates)","September 27, 2024 - 03:20"
262,Eritrean asylum issue continues to stump Swiss politicians,"Swiss vocational education teacher Hans Furrer knows Eritrea well. He has visited the country multiple times over the past four decades, promoting several initiatives in cooperation and development. His most recent visit was in March 2024.One of the most significant projects Furrer runs is the Massawa Workers Vocational Training Centre
External link
, which offers courses in seven different trades. “This project provides an opportunity for young people in Eritrea,” Furrer says. “Those who have completed their apprenticeships or refresher courses in our vocational school have not felt the need to leave the country and migrate to Europe.”Since its establishment in 2017, the vocational training school has experienced steady growth and now serves approximately 300 students each year. The project is a result of collaboration between the Swiss Support Committee for Eritrea and the National Congress of Eritrean Workers (NCEW) in the port city of Massawa.“The collaboration with the NCEW was key to our success,” adds Furrer. “In Eritrea, as in all counties of the Global South, it is essential to avoid an approach that resembles neocolonialism, assuming that we know what does not work and what needs to be changed. Thanks to the union, we were able to quickly establish connections with local companies and identify apprenticeship training needs.”The project, according to Furrer, stands out from other initiatives in Africa because it has proven to be the most sustainable. “During the pandemic we couldn’t go to Eritrea, and in that period the Eritrean teachers developed new projects completely under their own steam, opening new vocational schools in the cities of Keren and Barentu,” he says.The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) discontinued its activities in Eritrea in 2006 due to ongoing difficulties with the authorities and the inability to implement sustainable projects in the field. However, in October 2017, the SDC decided to resume cooperation and development activities in the country, including supporting vocational training projects like the Massawa Workers Vocational Training Center.The financial aid provided has two main objectives. On one hand, the SDC wants to develop the skills of Eritrean women and men in their home country. On the other hand, it hopes to build mutual trust and dialogue between the two governments, particularly on migration issues. After a two-year pilot phase which ended in 2019, the Swiss foreign ministry decided to continue the collaboration, with the second phase set to end in September 2024. In response to a query from SWI swissinfo.ch, the SDC stated that there are no plans for a third phase.The decision to return to Eritrea after a ten-year absence could be seen as being driven more by domestic political issues than by humanitarian interests or a larger commitment to development aid. But foreign ministry spokesperson Jonas Montani denies this interpretation. “This project does not have specific objectives in migration policy, but instead focuses on improving opportunities for young Eritreans and bilateral relations between the two countries,” he told SWI swissinfo.ch, while acknowledging that the SDC’s involvement could have a positive effect on Swiss migration policy.The impossibility of returning Eritreans whose asylum applications have been rejected by Switzerland is frequently discussed by politicians. Numerous parliamentary initiatives have been proposed by various parties in recent years. For example, in the latest summer session, the House of Representatives adopted a motion by Radical-Liberal senator Petra Gössi which calls on the government to find a solution for returning unsuccessful Eritrean asylum applicants.The idea is to send them to a third country with which Switzerland has a transit agreement, allowing them to be returned to their home country. However, left-wing parties and some members of the Centre Party oppose the idea, arguing that it will only result in more costs without achieving anything. Justice Minister Beat Jans has emphasised that Asmara will not take back its citizens, even if they are coming from another African state.In an initial evaluation report produced at the end of the first phase, the SDC says that “compared to the outset in 2017, Switzerland has much more information about the situation on the ground than it did in the past, it has access to government departments, it has built a basis of trust, and it has created an opening in view of new developments”.For the second phase too, the SDC commissioned an external evaluation, the conclusions of which will be published shortly. For Radical-Liberal parliamentarian Damian Müller, however, the results to date are insufficient. He proposes a change of strategy, arguing that the one in place is a mistake. “The fact that Eritrea continues to reject forced repatriations is proof of this,” he says. Müller is a member of the House of Representatives’ foreign policy committee. He maintains that Eritrea has no interest in development aid from this country.Sibel Arslan takes a different view. The Green Party politician says projects in Eritrea are important and that Switzerland should go on supporting them. She opposes the federal government’s approach of linking international cooperation strategically with migration policy.“Solidarity, support for populations in need and the fight against poverty are [values] enshrined in our constitution,” points out Arslan, the current vice-president of the House of Representatives’ foreign policy committee. “The Greens have always been against the idea of mixing international cooperation with migration policy. This kind of linkage is mistaken.”Arslan favors instead the search for solutions through dialogue, where Switzerland has a long tradition. So does Müller. “I propose to put the emphasis on political dialogue, as Italy is doing,” he says.Last January, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met the Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki in Rome. At the end of June, Minister of Enterprises and Made in Italy Adolfo Urso went to Asmara with a sizable delegation of heads of large Italian companies, and another delegation followed from the Italian Senate’s foreign relations and defense committee. These missions to Eritrea are part of what is known as the Mattei Plan, which aims to strengthen Italy’s role in Africa. Apart from reinforcing cooperation in development and partnerships with various African states, with this funding programme of €5.5 billion (CHF5.1 billion), Italy intends to stop migrants from arriving on its shores.The federal government’s website states that diplomatic relations between Switzerland and Eritrea are not very strong, although they have deepened in recent years. “Cooperation with Eritrean authorities has improved, especially in the area of identification,” Jonas Montani, foreign ministry spokesman, told SWI swissinfo.ch. Furthermore, Secretary of State for Migration Christine Schraner Burgener told the newspaper Sonntagsblick that Switzerland will appoint a liaison officer based in Nairobi, who will frequently visit Eritrea to pursue dialogue with Asmara.“No civil servant will achieve any results,” says Furrer, who believes that only a high-level meeting between Justice Minister Jans and his Eritrean counterpart will lead to meaningful negotiations.Until now, all diplomatic efforts to resolve the Eritrean issue have been unsuccessful. Two Swiss federal ministers, Didier Burkhalter and Simonetta Sommaruga, met with the Eritrean foreign minister in 2016. Current Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis has visited Asmara twice, in 2018 and 2019. In 2021, a meeting between special presidential advisor Yemane Gebreab and Secretaries of State Livia Leu and Mario Gattiker yielded no tangible results.Eritrea refuses to change its position. It rejects any forced repatriation of its citizens from Switzerland or any other countries, insisting that repatriation must be voluntary.One of the goals of the project managed by Furrer was to create an incentive for Eritreans to return. The Massawa Workers Vocational Training Center aimed to provide opportunities even for Eritreans in the diaspora.“The idea was to give Eritrean asylum seekers the opportunity to do a year-long apprenticeship in Switzerland and then continue at our vocational school in Massawa,” explains Furrer. “Yet this idea was never implemented, partly because no one willingly returns to Eritrea due to fear of repression by the regime.”This is not surprising. The latest United Nations report on Eritrea highlights systematic repression of basic freedoms and a dire human rights situation. The country is known for its use of “arbitrary and incommunicado detention” and indefinite military conscription, which is comparable to forced labor.Adapted from Italian by Terence MacNamee/ds","August 15, 2024 - 09:00"
263,Europe’s new energy commissioner takes on housing as well as fuel,"By Julia PayneBRUSSELS (Reuters) – The European Union’s newly announced Energy Commissioner will for the first time have the task of leading an EU housing division as well as dealing with more typical duties, such as seeking to lower fuel prices and implement green policy.Dan Jorgensen, named on Tuesday by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as part of her new team, is a former EU parliamentarian and a climate leader in his native Denmark, which has a track record of linking energy and energy-efficient housing policy.As commissioner, his challenges include helping to implement the EU’s ambitious Green Deal to try to keep the bloc on track to reduce carbon emissions. He must also deal with the ongoing impact on energy of Russia’s war on Ukraine.Europe’s energy prices have normalised since the extremes of the 2021-2022 energy crisis, but they remain high, making the continent increasingly uncompetitive compared with the rest of the world. Germany in particular has suffered from the loss of cheap Russian gas that fuelled its industry.A lack of grid interconnections in Germany – the EU’s biggest economy – also means a lot of cheap renewable energy produced in the north of the country is wasted and cannot boost the south.A report by former Italian prime minister and former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi presented to von der Leyen last week included warnings about the continent’s economic future.At the level of individual citizens, rather than big business, Jorgensen will have to address that in part as the Commission’s first dedicated commissioner for housing, helping to provide sustainable, affordable accommodation and “addressing energy poverty,” his mission letter made public on Tuesday says.ONGOING CHALLENGES.He also inherits tasks from previous commissioners seeking to lower energy costs.They include expanding a joint EU buying scheme started last year by senior Commission executive Maros Sefcovic to help member states source alternative natural gas sources and drawing up a roadmap to end Russian energy imports.That also means accelerating alternative sources of energy and modernising power grids.The Commission has taken some measures to improve the permitting process, but many companies complain it is still too cumbersome and has delayed fast charging stations for electric cars and the development of similar stations for electric and hydrogen-fuelled trucks.As Europe seeks to shift to greener energy, von der Leyen also wants Jorgensen to work with climate chief Wopke Hoekstra to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, which remain present through different taxation regimes across member states.Another responsibility likely to divide opinion across the bloc is Jorgensen’s task to accelerate the deployment of small modular nuclear reactors that require less cooling water. Many projects have been proposed and launched across the continent but the costs are high and funding uncertain.Infrastructure security is another potential headache after an increase in cyber attacks and sabotage since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.","September 17, 2024 - 18:32"
264,Russia portrays itself as ‘last line of defence for traditional values’,"SWI swissinfo.ch: Russia’s highest court recently called the “international LGBTQ movement” an “extremist organisation”. What does this mean, and how significant is the ruling?Leandra Bias: We can’t yet say what it concretely means for queer communities in Russia. However, there are initial impacts, such as the closing of gay bars and support groups – the operating of which could be interpreted as a form of activism.Homosexuality or transsexuality is not banned per se in Russia. But the public expression of activism in any shape or form is no longer allowed. Exactly how that will be interpreted at the individual level remains open.However, if we look at the strategic significance, it’s clearly a further radicalisation. It’s a result of the increasingly protracted war [in Ukraine]: domestically, the Russian regime is becoming more authoritarian in order to more effectively maintain control.This also fits into the narrative which has been circulating since 2014 with respect to Ukraine, which is that Russia is the last line of defence for the protection of traditional values. And here, the narrative can’t just remain rhetorical, but also has to be implemented.SWI: Russian President Vladimir Putin refers again and again to these “traditional values”. What do they entail?L.B.: What’s intriguing is that they are never clearly defined. That’s also their strength: anyone – or any government – can project onto them whatever benefits them. It’s also interesting that before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin would continually dance around their meaning depending on which group he was addressing.Over time, these values have come to influence the country’s official strategy. From 2013, they became part of Russian foreign and security policy, and they took on an increasingly confrontational tone. And from 2016, Russia has clearly indicated that geopolitical competition is not only political or technological, but also value-based.Putin himself had often been reserved about the issue, but this changed in the past years, as we know. The Ukraine invasion was accompanied by references to – among other things – these traditional values.And the term itself remains effective. Researchers call it an “empty signifier”: a term without a clear meaning which can be defined as desired. As for concrete policies which can stem from it, this has also become clear since the invasion of Ukraine, with women’s rights – specifically reproductive rights – being challenged in Russia. The right to abortion has come under various attacks, including by Putin himself. Recently he’s been enthusing about fertile mothers; medals are to be awarded to women who give birth to several children. All of this is connected to an explicit attack on the queer community.SWI: Many buzzwords with unclear meanings are used in political and media discourse – such as “gender ideology”. What is the target of this term, and how does it enable certain forms of politics to develop?L.B.: “Traditional values” are the mirror image of “gender ideology”. Traditional values are, so to speak, what is being propagated in Russia. But there’s nothing specifically Russian about them: this trend is also seen in many other countries which are either authoritarian or leaning towards authoritarianism.They are used as a tool: an illiberal stance on gender is part of efforts to uphold an illiberal political system generally. Over the past decade we’ve seen direct attacks on democracy happening alongside attacks on gender equality. There’s a clear correlation.SWI: What is it that proponents of “traditional values” concretely criticise?L.B.: They see “gender ideology” as a form of perversion and an existential threat to humanity. To put it bluntly: if gender equality were to be achieved, humanity would disappear – nobody would reproduce anymore, everybody would be homosexual, or feminists who get divorced and have abortions. This is exactly what’s currently happening in the West, the argument goes.Since 2013, the idea that the West tries to export and promote this “perverse ideology” has become part of Russian state doctrine. In Russia, the ideology is purportedly spread via feminists and the LGBTQ movement.The last step in this line of thinking is that it’s not only gender equality which is a cynical element of Western power, but everything related to human rights and democracy – all are Western exports serving to establish and consolidate Western dominance.As a result, Russia feels that to maintain its standing it needs to not only fight against feminism and equality, but against the entire idea of democratisation.SWI: To what extent do misogyny and anti-LGBTQ policies drive authoritarianism? Or to what extent are they a result of it?L.B.: The same question could be asked of democracy: to what extent does democracy foster equality, or to what extent does equality foster democracy? The reality is that both act on each other reciprocally. The more a social and democratic movement contains a commitment to equality, the more likely it is to result in sustainable democratisation.And for an autocrat who wants to retain or cement power, repressive tactics are not just the outcome of an intrinsic anti-feminist or anti-LGBTQ outlook. They are also strategic, since such movements are proven drivers and catalysts of democratisation.SWI: These culture wars are not confined to Russia. To what extent are they coordinated around the world? Is there a “global anti-LGBTQ movement”?L.B.: Yes, I consciously call it either an “anti-feminist” or “anti-gender” international movement. I think it’s important to stress that both aspects are combined: it’s explicitly about established women’s rights as well as LGBTQ rights. This movement attacks both, and it is coordinated.One example is the World Congress of Families, founded in 1997. This transnational NGO was mainly driven by US Evangelists, but the original founders were an American and a Russian – showing that the connection stretches back quite a while.The organisation explicitly defined its goal as upholding the heterosexual nuclear family as a pillar of humanity and protector of human life from the moment of conception – as such, it aims to criminalise divorce, abortion, and same-sex marriage. It lobbies for these demands both publicly and with decision-makers.Since its founding, it has held regular regional and global congresses, and has attracted more and more prestigious guests – Viktor Orbán, for example, is most welcome. The second congress was held in 1999 in Geneva, and even if its initiatives to restrict abortion didn’t amount to anything, Swiss organisations like Pro Life and Swiss Aid for Mother and Child use arguments and strategies which stem directly from what they learned at these congresses.SWI: That doesn’t exactly sound like global coordination.L.B.: Sure, we’re not talking about a single global strategy here. These groups operate by learning from each other about what works and what doesn’t, since issues of equality differ depending on their context. Sometimes it works better to attack sexual education programmes, or Drag Queen Story Hour events.Elsewhere, in Russia it’s mooted that having an LGBTQ tattoo could be prosecuted under criminal law. In Italy, doctors who refuse to carry out abortions for reasons of conscience and who are subsequently sued are supported financially. In this case, it’s about comparing arguments and methods, but this also has practical implications.Translated from German by Domhnall O’Sullivan","December 11, 2023 - 09:00"
265,Maldives will have no foreign military presence – new president,"By Mohamed JunaydMALE (Reuters) – Maldives will use diplomacy to ensure there is no foreign military presence on its soil, its new president said on Friday, reaffirming his support for the departure of a small Indian force from the islands where India and China vie for influence.Mohamed Muizzu was speaking at his inauguration after winning a presidential election in September, beating incumbent Ibrahim Solih in a second-round runoff.Solih had followed an “India first” policy, but Muizzu in his election campaign promised to remove a small Indian military presence of about 75 personnel from the Maldives.The Indian Ocean island chain will have a “thick red line” when it comes to security related issues, Muizzu said in his inauguration speech. He also pledged to respect the “security red line of any other country”.“Using the instrument of diplomacy, I will ensure that this country has no foreign military presence on its soil. I assure you there is no greater honour for me than being loyal to my beloved Maldives,” he added.Muizzu had said last month he would work to return Indian military personnel “as soon as possible”, but he has also emphasised his commitment to stronger investment ties with both India and China to foster growth.Home to about 521,000 people, Maldives is famous for its sun-kissed atolls and luxury tourist resorts.Rival Asian giants India and China have both invested millions of dollars in the islands as they seek to build influence.Public debt remains high, due to sustained borrowing to finance the budget deficit and infrastructure projects. Total public and publicly guaranteed debt rose to $7 billion, or 113.5% of GDP, at the end of 2022, from $5.9 billion, or 112.1% of GDP, the year before, according to World Bank figures.Muizzu described growing debt as a “danger,” and pledged to take “swift and bold” measures to tackle the problem.State officials from key countries were present at Muizzu’s inauguration, including U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Samantha Power and Chinese State Councillor Shen Yiqin, who will fly to Sri Lanka on Saturday after wrapping up his visit to the Maldives.(Writing by Uditha Jayasinghe; Editing by Mark Potter)","November 17, 2023 - 14:31"
266,US ESG Bond Market Facing Slow Death as Sales Hit Five-Year Low,"(Bloomberg) — The bonds were supposed to change the world. US companies and banks are increasingly uninterested in selling them.Bonds that fund companies’ environmental projects, or give corporations an incentive to improve their governance or achieve social goals like boosting gender equality, have seen sales drop this year. US-based companies sold just $18.2 billion of the debt, known as environmental, social and governance bonds, through August 16 — the least since 2019’s $12.5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The decline comes as sales of other investment-grade corporate debt has jumped.Banks and investors cite a series of reasons for the drop. Republican politicians in states like Texas and Kansas have been trying to block government entities from considering ESG issues when buying securities. More investors are questioning whether the bonds achieve their goals or just amount to greenwashing. And US ESG-related stock mutual funds have returned 14% on average this year, underperforming the S&P 500 index. This marks an about-face from a few years ago when demand for sustainable debt funds surged as investors clamored for assets aimed at making the world better, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and social upheaval following the killing of George Floyd. Companies issued a record $94.5 billion in ESG bonds in 2021 on the back of that demand.The politicization of ESG debt has also eroded the price advantage that issuers enjoyed during the ESG market’s boom years. Environmentally-conscious investors previously rewarded issuers with a juicy so-called greenium — the spread of an issuer’s green bonds to non-green bonds. But that price benefit has been disappearing in the US high-grade market, resulting in a loss of investor appetite that has made it less practical for US companies to come to market. Debut issuers in particular, which turbo-charged the US ESG market during the pandemic years, have been pulling back. First-timers typically have to draft a bond framework outlining how the proceeds will be used, pay for the framework to be verified by third parties and take on the burden of reporting the use of proceeds to investors annually.CFOs have also had to sometimes halt funding plans as recession concerns and central bank rate hikes roiled global debt markets. When issuance windows do open, treasurers have prioritized executing plain vanilla deals over more time-consuming green bonds. “If you’ve got concerns about future market volatility, your focus is on getting the deals done now,” said Tracy Patel, senior vice president of capital markets at Prologis Inc. “If you then add on top of that the fact that they may not have a framework and the greenium is uncertain, when you’re in that situation, are you going to potentially slow yourself down? That’s probably what CFOs are weighing.”The six biggest US banks, which used to be regular issuers of the bonds, have also retreated. Last year, they collectively raised $3.2 billion of ESG debt, the lowest volume since 2018, Bloomberg-compiled data shows. Citigroup Inc. remains the only big Wall Street bank that has issued a benchmark-sized ESG bond this year, while Bank of America Corp. — the biggest corporate issuer of US ESG bonds — last came to the market in June 2023. Both offerings were in the European high-grade market.“Our sustainable bond offerings generally track with our overall debt issuance, which has steadily declined over time,” a BofA representative said in a statement. To be sure, not everyone is pessimistic about the future of the US ESG debt market.“While the market may not see the issuance of labeled securities as frequently in the US, US companies aren’t necessarily operating differently,” said Emily Kreps, Deutsche Bank AG’s global head of ESG and sustainable finance, and head of ESG Americas. She points out that corporate strategies are set five to 10 years in the future, which means leaders may continue executing them in the long-run.“I don’t think the green bond market in the US will disappear, rather it will continue to evolve and become increasingly differentiated from its global peers,” she said. “Some industries, particularly those traditionally hard-to-abate sectors, will have the opportunity to pursue financing linked to transition innovation. This may develop more quickly than others in the global arena.”Outside the US, issuers are selling ESG bonds at an accelerated pace. Global sales stood at over $660 billion as of August 16, up 6.9% compared to the same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg shows, as sovereign issuers — including nations selling the bonds for the first time — help drive sales. In Europe, which dominates the sustainable debt market, green corporate bonds have gained 2.5% this year, roughly in line with the 2.4% gain for plain vanilla debt. Even so, companies like Irish building materials business CRH Plc, which are considering issuing ESG debt, have so far hesitated to take the plunge.  “It didn’t make sense financially,” said Jim Mintern, CFO of CRH. “There wasn’t the competitive aspect on the interest rate coupon to support the investment. It has to make sense.”Bloomberg News reached out to at least two-dozen US-based companies that have issued ESG bonds in the past for this story, including the nation’s six biggest banks and Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Mastercard Inc., and Walmart Inc.All except BofA, Prologis and CRH either declined to comment or didn’t respond to a request for comment, with a few of them referring Bloomberg to their latest green bond reports.–With assistance from Nina Trentmann and Immanual John Milton.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","August 19, 2024 - 16:37"
267,Price expectations for Swiss real estate are falling,"The experts at KPMG came to this conclusion based on the survey results for the Swiss Real Estate Sentiment Index. According to the information, this reflects the expectations of professional investors, developers, consultants and evaluators about the Swiss real estate investment market.Accordingly, the latest survey resulted in negative price expectations for all segments, locations and regions. According to the survey published on Monday, price expectations in central locations such as Zurich were negative for the first time. Those surveyed cited interest rate risks and regulation as the main reasons for the expected decline in real estate values.The approximately 350 survey participants were also rather disillusioned when it came to sustainability. Only 18% of those surveyed believe that the net zero target for 2050 can be achieved.The gloomy outlook is also shared by financial experts. For example, the analysts at Baader Helvea write in a comment on the KPMG survey that they are sticking to their own “cautious” assessment of the Swiss real estate market. From an investor’s perspective, real estate companies with “lower-risk business models and conservative balance sheets” should be preferred.","September 25, 2023 - 11:24"
268,Hungary gives fuel traders two weeks to match regional average prices,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) – Hungary’s government is giving fuel traders two weeks to adjust their prices to the central European average, Economy Minister Marton Nagy was quoted by the index.hu outlet as telling a news conference on Wednesday.Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government scrapped a fuel price cap in December 2022 after a lack of imports and panic buying led to fuel shortages, but promised it would intervene again if fuel prices rose above the regional average.On Tuesday, the national bank said fuel price margins had widened since the cap was scrapped, exceeding not just their previous levels but also average levels seen elsewhere in central Europe.“In two weeks, the government will revisit this issue, look at price developments and intervene with tough measures if fuel retailers do not return to the regional average,” Marton Nagy was quoted as saying.On Tuesday, deputy central bank governor Barnabas Virag said he believed any intervention that “moves the market towards a lasting and sustainable decrease in these margins, setting fuel prices on a lasting and sustainable lower path” was justified.In the first quarter of last year, annual inflation in Hungary stood at 25%, the highest in the European Union. It stood at 3.6% last March, but economists see it rebounding to 5.4% by the end of 2024 as base effects fade and services inflation stays hot.Morgan Stanley economist Georgi Deyanov said Hungary’s plan to align fuel prices to the regional average could trim 20 to 30 basis points off headline inflation, raising the chances of keeping it within the central bank’s tolerance band.“We think that such an outcome would create a favourable environment for the NBH to proceed with 25bp of rate cuts per meeting in 3Q24,” he said.“Yet, for the central bank to consider such an option, we believe more favourable global financial conditions would need to materialise too.”","April 24, 2024 - 17:19"

270,Green hydrogen: an opportunity to be carefully managed,"There has been much talk in recent years about hydrogen’s role in the clean energy transition, particularly in sectors that cannot rely only on electricity. It could supply heat for glass manufacturing, for example, or fuel aircraft and ships. There are, indeed, several ways to produce hydrogen, with different impacts in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is said to be “green” if we use renewable electricity to produce it. This is now a promising prospect, as electricity from solar and wind farms has become much cheaper

than in the past.The most immediate contribution is to replace “grey” hydrogen, that is, hydrogen derived from fossil sources, which is already used in some industrial processes and refining. Hydrogen consumption in Switzerland is limited – a 2018 study
External link
 calculates around 13,000 tonnes per year – but globally, demand has reached 94 million tonnes by 2021, of which less than 1% is low-emission.However, the technologies that allow hydrogen to be used are still very new and evolving rapidly. This leaves room for uncertainty about where and how to use hydrogen efficiently. It could happen, for example, that the direct use of electricity becomes cheaper than the use of green hydrogen in some consumption segments. In the case of heavy land transport, for example, some experiences suggest that the costs of hydrogen trains and even hydrogen trucks may be higher than expected. Fuel cell cars also seem destined for a residual market share, given the success of electric cars. In the case of air and sea transport, however, hydrogen seems more promising, either in pure form or as a component of synthetic fuels, which can already be blended with conventional fuels.The main challenge is to produce green hydrogen without diverting renewable electricity from other more environmentally and economically beneficial uses. The growth of renewable sources in Switzerland, Europe and elsewhere in the world is not yet sufficient to ensure a zero-emission electricity supply, so it is important to create favourable conditions for hydrogen research and investment without derailing the transition path to direct use of clean electricity, which remains a priority.The uses of hydrogen should be well thought out. This is because hydrogen is not an energy source, but rather an energy vector. For example, the surplus electricity from solar farms could be used to produce green hydrogen that can be stored for times when these plants do not meet demand. In short, hydrogen could be used as a battery to store electricity from the summer months and release it again in the winter, which would be particularly useful for Switzerland.However, this process has a high cost, related both to the energy losses involved in the two transformations (the efficiency of the process is estimated at 25-30%) and to the costs of storing and possibly transporting the hydrogen. It should also not be forgotten that a large surplus of renewable electricity would have to be generated in the summer months.With regard to production, it will be important to adopt a clear definition of green hydrogen in Switzerland, possibly in line with that adopted in the European Union
External link
. This will serve to enable cross-border trade and protect Swiss consumers with respect to the sustainability of imported hydrogen.Concerning the development of new infrastructure, it will be necessary to understand the level of demand for green hydrogen in Switzerland and abroad to create a competitive and efficient supply chain. After an initial phase of developing localised clusters, some pipelines, such as Transitgas in Switzerland, could be converted to hydrogen transport at a reasonable cost, along with some natural gas storage sites and regasification terminals. However, it will be important to avoid investments that are oversized or inconsistent with the Swiss and global energy and decarbonisation scenarios.The possibility of producing green hydrogen at low cost and exporting it to profitable markets is also an attractive opportunity for many countries currently focused on hydrocarbons and could accelerate the path to diversification and transition. For some countries in Eastern Europe and North Africa, for example, a partnership with Switzerland and the European Union would be advantageous, given their geographic proximity and the presence of natural gas infrastructure that could be repurposed. Green hydrogen is also a tool to involve the gas industry in the energy transition, which could benefit from a longer use of its existing infrastructure and contribute through its expertise.When weighing up the various pros and cons of the energy transition, green hydrogen may therefore become extremely significant despite the different caveats, particularly for the most exposed sectors and countries in the hydrocarbon economy. The path is not yet well marked out and requires some balance, but it is worth pursuing.The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of SWI swissinfo.ch.

The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 31 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause.“There has been speculation that by concluding enough ofthese agreements, we do not need membership. False. We need NATOmembership,” said Ihor Zhovkva, the Ukrainian president’sforeign affairs adviser.WHO HAS SIGNED DEALS SO FAR?Germany and France signed agreements on security commitments with Ukraine when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited Berlin and Paris earlier this month.Britain in January became the first country to sign one of the security agreements with Ukraine for a term of 10 years, bywhich time Kyiv hopes to be inside NATO.London said the deal formalised a range of support that it “has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence-sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defence industrial cooperation”.WHICH OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SET TO SIGN DEALS?Ukraine has held at least two rounds of talks on theagreements with all the G7 countries, Zhovkva said.More than 10 countries are in the active stage of talks or potentially starting soon, he added. The additional countries include Romania, Poland and the Netherlands.The Netherlands said on Friday it would soon sign a 10-year security deal with Ukraine for continued military support, help in reconstruction and the improvement of its cyberdefences.“Without Western support, Ukraine as we know it will cease to exist,” Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot said. “The Russian threat will move closer, putting pressure on the stability and safety of our continent.”WHAT DOES UKRAINE WANT FROM THE DEALS?Ukraine’s Zhovkva singled out as “very important” theprovision in the British deal under which consultations could beheld within 24 hours to provide swift and sustained aid.This, he said, went beyond the “infamous” 1994 BudapestMemorandum under which Ukraine was provided with security”assurances” by Britain, Russia and the United States in returnfor relinquishing nuclear weapons from its territory.“We do not want to repeat the infamous experience of theBudapest declaration, which remained just a declaration,” hesaid.Zhovkva said there was no need for Ukraine to rush to agreedeals. “I don’t need 10 or 15 agreements concluded within oneweek. Rather, I would have this same 10 or 15 agreements deeplythought over, well-negotiated and with concrete signs oflong-term and varied support for Ukraine.”","February 23, 2024 - 18:02"
273,"Conflict, creditors and a car crash: How Ukraine clinched a wartime debt restructuring","By Marc Jones and Karin StroheckerLONDON (Reuters) -Just a few months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the country’s financial adviser, Rothschild & Co, handed Kyiv’s debt chief a thick black folder detailing major sovereign debt restructurings of the past 30 years.For Yuriy Butsa, 40, it would prove essential reading. He hadn’t been involved in the debt rework Ukraine required in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea and it wasn’t long before he would need to draw on the expertise.Facing an economy crippled by the cost and destruction of the war, by August 2022 Ukraine agreed with creditors to pause payments on its bonds. With no end to the conflict in sight, last week the nation sealed one of the fastest – and largest – debt restructurings in history.Eclipsed in scale only by Argentina and Greece, the restructuring of more than $20 billion of debt will save Kyiv $11.4 billion over the next three years – crucial for both its ongoing war effort and its International Monetary Fund programme.“A stable situation where no more question marks are out there can only benefit Ukraine,” Arvid Tuerkner, managing director for Ukraine and Moldova at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, one of Kyiv’s big multilateral partners, told Reuters.This account of how Ukraine’s agreement with bondholders came together is based on interviews with five sources on both government and investor side who were involved in the talks and agreed to speak with Reuters on the condition of anonymity.REVIVING TALKSInitial negotiations between the government and its lenders hadn’t gone to plan.Talks in June had broken down after a couple of weeks with the core committee of bondholders complaining that the writedown Ukraine was demanding was “significantly in excess” of the 20% most had expected and risked doing “substantial damage” to relations.With less than two months till the August 2022 payment moratorium expired, Rothschild arranged face-to-face meetings at the firm’s elegant Parisian offices on the leafy Avenue de Messine.Early on July 16, representatives of some of the world’s top asset management firms and their legal and financial advisers arrived in Paris, where they joined Butsa, Ukraine’s long-term legal advisers White & Case and the Rothschild team. A raft of meeting rooms, adorned with pictures of the famous Rothschild vineyards, had been reserved to allow for joint discussions and private strategising.The mood was pragmatic from the start, sources on both the government and the creditor side said. Everyone had come in the hope of doing a deal – even though both sides were still far apart. EXCEPTIONAL UNCERTAINTYThere was reason to be back in talks.As well as the looming deadline, the IMF, providing Ukraine with $15.6 billion of support, had just updated its projections. They had reflected a worsening economic picture, but nevertheless gave a new base to work from.Ukraine kicked off by setting out its proposal. Members of a key bondholder group, representing some of the world’s biggest asset managers such as BlackRock and Amundi, got to explain their demands too: that Ukraine restart ‘coupon’ payments immediately, offer a path to a higher principal recovery and, importantly, “keep it simple”.Both the IMF and Rothschild declined to comment for this story but according to two sources, the IMF’s experts were on call in both Kyiv and Washington during the negotiations in an exceptional arrangement.That was vital for doing the labour-intensive modelling needed to work out what each proposed compromise would mean for Ukraine’s longer-term debt sustainability.By 4am on July 18 in Paris, or 5am in Kyiv and nearly 48 hours into the process, another request was made to the IMF teams to rerun the numbers. Some of those crunching the figures had barely slept.The Fund’s help was invaluable, its staff worked at breakneck speed and helped to overcome multiple obstacles.Discussions around how to tap Russia’s frozen assets and confusion around a new IMF policy designed to try and help it adapt to the realities of a full-blown war had meant talks hadn’t been able to start at April’s IMF Spring meetings as hoped, and were still causing issues.Butsa’s team and the IMF were also adamant that there couldn’t be anything like the costly ‘GDP warrants’ used to sweeten its 2015 restructuring. Under their terms, Kyiv is required to stump up a large chunk of its economic output if nominal GDP exceeds $125.4 billion and annual growth hits 3%.But Ukraine was providing an alternative in the form of a simpler GDP-linked bond, and creditors were also being offered the instant coupon payments that they had wanted, starting at a rate of 1.75% and eventually rising to 7.75%.Structured to be eligible for the main bond indexes and therefore easier to buy and sell, it meant the gap between the sides had been as good as bridged. With just the fine print to finalise, those in Paris made their exits as the packed city put the finishing touches on its Olympics preparations.CAR CRASHThe drama wasn’t entirely over, however. Driving back from the Polish airport where his flight had landed – the most reliable route since Russia’s invasion halted flights from Kyiv – a driver turned across Ukraine debt chief Butsa’s VW Golf.No one was hurt, but Butsa was now sitting in an insurance office in Lviv filling out forms whilst taking calls to finalise the statement that the $20 billion restructuring had, in principle, been agreed.The resounding final result from the bondholder vote was more than 97% support.(Reporting by Marc Jones and Karin Strohecker in London; additional reporting by Libby George; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Christina Fincher)","September 3, 2024 - 17:55"
274,"G20 finance chiefs see ‘good prospects’ for global soft landing, draft communique says","By Marcela AyresWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Finance chiefs from the leading developed and emerging economies see “good prospects” for a soft landing for the global economy, and they have committed to resist protectionism, according to a G20 draft communique seen by Reuters on Wednesday ahead of the group’s meeting this week.The document, which a source said may still be revised, lands as global finance ministers gather this week in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank amid rising confidence that central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have successfully beaten back inflation without crippling growth or employment.But it also reflects palpable concerns that that promising scenario could be upended should a global trade war break out in the event Donald Trump is elected U.S. president in less than two weeks.“We observe good prospects of a soft landing of the global economy, although multiple challenges remain,” according to the draft, which Reuters reviewed ahead of a G20 finance ministers gathering set for Thursday.“We are reassured by the fact that economic activity has proved to be more resilient than expected in many parts of the world,” the draft said. “Still, growth has been highly uneven across countries, contributing to the risk of economic divergence.”The ministers commended central banks’ “well-calibrated monetary policies” that have brought inflation largely under control and have allowed a global shift to lower interest rates.TRADE WAR CONCERNSStill, concerns continue to swirl around the outlook, which features medium- and long-term estimates for global growth that are below historic trend levels. Indeed, leading the list of concerns is the prospect of global trade strife should Trump, who has pledged to impose a global 10% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S. and a 60% levy on imports from China, win the Nov. 5 election.“We commit to resist protectionism and encourage concerted efforts to support a rules-based, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core and continue to support the reform efforts of the organization by its members,” the draft said.Brazil’s Finance Minister Fernando Haddad on Wednesday expressed confidence that G20 finance leaders would approve a joint statement, reflecting consensus in their discussions, after successfully doing so at their last meeting in July.The draft communique has kept the language agreed upon in July regarding the group’s commitment to tax transparency and fostering global dialogue on effective taxation, including of “ultra-high-net-worth individuals.”While the commitment stops short of endorsing a global tax on billionaires – an idea introduced by Brazil’s G20 presidency – it was viewed as a victory by the delegation of Latin America’s largest economy for keeping the issue on the agenda and politically strengthening any proposals that individual countries may present, two sources told Reuters.However, both sources acknowledged that the real challenge will come at the leaders’ summit next month, as a potential Trump victory could prompt those who have privately opposed the proposal to publicly take a stance against the need for more progressive taxation on billionaires, including Argentina’s Javier Milei.(Reporting By Marcela Ayres; Writing by Dan Burns; Editing by Andrea Ricci)","October 23, 2024 - 19:36"
275,The challenges of decentralising vaccine production to Africa,"During the Covid pandemic, the US pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson produced their Covid vaccine in South Africa. This was then exported to Europe, leaving the local population with no production for themselves.Get more insights into the international organisations directly from our correspondents in Geneva: sign up to our Inside Geneva newsletter.In the wake of the pandemic, Gavi, which aims to improve the supply of vaccines to poorer countries, is pushing for better access to vaccines to become a priority for the international community, an approach that is widely supported by the G7 and G20 countries.“Today, Africa imports 99% of the vaccines that are needed on the continent,” David Kinder, Gavi’s director of development financing, tells SWI swissinfo.ch. This includes vaccines against malaria and cholera, which kill hundreds of thousands of children every year. The Gavi vaccine alliance includes UN organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the World Bank, as well as developing and donor countries, the vaccine industry, research institutions, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and NGOs.Their solution to avoid another hoarding of vaccines by rich countries, as was the case during the Covid-19 pandemic, is decentralising vaccine production and promoting production in the countries that need them most: those on the African continent.To achieve this, Gavi launched a new financing instrument: the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA). This will help the African Union, which comprises 55 countries in the continent, produce 60% of the vaccines they need by 2040. The official launch of the AVMA is planned for June 20 in Paris.The AVMA is a fund endowed with $1 billion (CHF900 million) over ten years. The money comes from outstanding funds in the Covax initiative. This multilateral collaboration, launched in 2020 to provide poorer countries with vaccines against the Sars-Cov-2 virus, was terminated in December 2023.“Gavi’s goal with the AVMA is to create a market to lower vaccine prices,” Kinder explains.The AVMA intends to help African manufacturers remain competitive against well-established players such as Johnson & Johnson or Roche, which are able to drive down their prices due to economies of scale.This is a historic change from previous efforts in which Gavi focused its budget on mostly buying vaccines from the world’s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers. For a long time, this approach was considered cost-effective. However, it also increased the concentration of vaccine production among a few manufacturers and left little room for new suppliers.As one of the largest purchasers of vaccines worldwide, Gavi is sending a strong signal to the global markets that it supports African vaccine production, Kinder says. This will help manufacturers plan production based on expected demand.How will the AVMA work? The fund will support African manufacturers with two incentive payments to help them create a level playing field with other producers around the world. As a starting point, Gavi has defined vaccines that the fund should prioritise. In addition to those against cholera and malaria, these include those against measles, rubella, yellow fever and Ebola. Gavi also wants to focus parts of the AVMA on new technologies that will enable African manufacturers to quickly adapt their production in the event of a next pandemic. These include synthetic gene-based mRNA and viral vector vaccines. Unlike previous vaccines, neither of these contain inactivated pathogens, but they introduce the genetic blueprint for pathogen antigens into human cells. The cells then use these instructions to produce antigens themselves, which trigger an immune response.So far, mRNA has been authorised only for the Covid-19 vaccine, but it’s a technology pushed by the WHO, which is supporting governments in establishing production capacities. “We have set up a technology transfer centre for mRNA in South Africa, which will pass on the technology to our partners in 15 countries,” says Martin Friede, co-head of the WHO mRNA technology transfer programme.African manufacturers first have to apply for a prequalification – that is self-financed — of their vaccine at the WHO. Those that qualify will receive an initial payment of between $10 and 25 million from the AVMA. The maximum amounts are earmarked for mRNA and vector vaccines. The second payment is intended to help African manufacturers submit their offer to Gavi tenders.“They will receive between $0.30 and $0.50 per dose so that they can compete on equal terms with our established manufacturers,” says Kinder. This is also meant to send a signal to investors such as the World Bank or the European Investment Bank (EIB) that the production is guaranteed to be sold.While the AVMA is the international initiative providing most financing to promote local production of vaccines, observers say many issues remain unanswered for African countries to become producers in their own right. The AVMA programme leaves producers looking for their own funds for much of the product pipeline: from R&D to clinical trials, production and distribution. Els Torreele, a bioengineer and independent researcher at University College London (UCL), says the World Bank and the EIB willingly finance the development of infrastructure, often with loans or investments that have to generate returns. But development financial institutions are nearly absent when it comes to financing product development or providing grants. As an example, the South African company Afrigen is currently struggling to obtain funding for the development of an mRNA product pipeline, which included developing a Covid-19 vaccine. The company is at the centre of the initiative coordinated by the WHO to decentralise mRNA production.To ensure equal opportunities, Torreele also believes that production must not only be local but also be embedded in national and regional health policies.Currently AVMA defines local production as being geographically located in Africa, Torreele says. This means that an international company that produces vaccines in Africa through a subsidiary is eligible for funding. The fact that such “localised” production does not lead to fair results was illustrated, for example, by the production of the Covid-19 vaccines by Johnson & Johnson in South Africa, mentioned at the beginning of this article.Furthermore, no money is planned by the AVMA for the acquisition of transfer of technology. This is meant to happen indirectly, for example by an outside competitor investing in the production facilities, such as an Indian manufacturer. This leaves the local manufacturer in a weak position to negotiate.If you want to support technology transfer (TT), you have to finance it directly, Torreele says. “TT contracts must be fair and conducive to the development of local production capacities. However, the conditions are often restrictive because a company does not want to strengthen its competitors,” she says.Friede from the WHO would also welcome increased TT funding.  The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), a lobby group, says a sustainable vaccine ecosystem and equitable access to innovative vaccines in Africa requires the cooperation of all stakeholders.Torreele emphasises that for an equitable supply of vaccines, developing countries and local manufacturers must have the power to decide on the technology and facilities for vaccine production, what they produce and for whom they produce it.“The biotech sector in Africa is still young,” says Kinder from Gavi. “It will take some time for new manufacturers to reach the required size for sustainable production.”Edited by Virginie Mangin/ts","June 2, 2024 - 10:00"
276,"China hits back at West’s over-capacity allegations in EVs, lithium batteries","By Ellen Zhang and Joe CashDALIAN, China (Reuters) -China’s Premier Li Qiang used his address at a World Economic Forum meeting in Dalian to hit back at accusations from the U.S. and EU that Chinese firms benefit from unfair subsidies and are poised to flood their markets with cheap green technologies.Li’s comments come as China and the European Union prepare to host technical talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) imported into the 27-strong bloc and after the United States unveiled steep tariff hikes on an array of Chinese imports, including EV batteries, in May.“China’s production of advanced electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic products, etcetera, first met our domestic demand, but also enrich global supply,” Li said in opening remarks in the northeastern Chinese city on Tuesday.“The rapid rise of China’s new industries is rooted in our own unique comparative advantages,” Li added.Brussels’ trade policy has turned increasingly protective and aligned with that of Washington over concerns China’s production-focused development model could see it flooded with cheap goods as Chinese firms look to step up exports amid weak domestic demand.Beijing has warned Brussels it risks opening up a new front in the West’s trade war with Beijing – which began with Washington’s initial import tariffs in 2018 – and opened an anti-dumping probe into EU pork imports following the EU’s tariff decision.“The continuous emergence of economies of scale can effectively dilute enterprises’ innovation costs… which is the real source of the strong competitiveness of China’s new industries,” Li said.China maintains it simply decided to invest in green technologies earlier, and that the West’s actions are unjustified.“China’s really made headway into producing these cars at low cost… so it is a lesson for us to try to get our act together and be better at it,” said Benoit Boulet, professor of electrical and computer engineering at McGill University, on the summit’s sidelines.“It’s seen as a threat at the very beginning, but then eventually Chinese cars will come to North America.”China and Chinese analysts have consistently rejected accusations it has an over-capacity problem or that its firms benefit from unfair subsidies, asserting that as the $18.6 trillion economy recovers, supply will better meet demand.Li told delegates “the rapid growth of new industries and new driving forces has strongly supported and sustained the healthy development of China’s economy.”“Since the beginning of this year, China’s economy has maintained an upward trend… and is expected to continue to improve steadily over the second quarter,” Li said.“We are confident and capable of achieving the full-year economic growth target of around 5%,” he added.(Reporting by Ellen Zhang and Joe Cash; Writing by Joe Cash; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Raju Gopalakrishnan)","June 25, 2024 - 07:55"

278,Ukraine says it sank Russian large landing warship in Black Sea,"By Tom Balmforth and Pavel PolityukKYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine destroyed a Russian landing warship off the coast of occupied Crimea in an operation with naval drones that breached the vessel’s port side on Wednesday and caused it to sink, Kyiv’s military spy agency and armed forces said.There was no immediate comment from Russia, which said earlier that it had destroyed six drones in the Black Sea. The Kremlin declined to comment.“The Ukrainian Armed Forces, together with the Defence Ministry’s intelligence unit, destroyed the Tsezar Kunikov large landing ship. It was in Ukraine’s territorial waters near Alupka at the time of the hit,” the military said on Telegram messenger.The Black Sea resort town of Alupka lies not far from Yalta on the southern edge of Crimea, which Russian forces seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014.“Today, more security in the Black Sea and more motivation for our people were added. This is important. And step by step, we will clear the Black Sea of Russian terrorist objects,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence agency said the warship appeared to have been loaded when it sank and that, before the attack, it had spent some 10 days at a loading site used by the Russian military.It published grainy footage on Telegram purporting to show several naval drones approaching a large vessel at night and at least one large explosion.Reuters was able to verify the ship in the video as the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s Tsezar Kunikov based on its main mast, antenna, bridge and deck. The location and date the footage was filmed could not be independently verified.Some of the footage at the end appeared to show major damage with the vessel listing heavily to one side.“In summary, Tsezar Kunikov received a critical breach on the port side and started sinking,” the GUR agency said in a statement.The Project 775 warship, one of Russia’s newest vessels, has a crew of 87 and took part in wars in Georgia, Syria and Ukraine, GUR said in its statement.A Ukrainian news outlet published several videos showing a column of smoke rising over the sea off the southern coast of Crimea with helicopters flying overhead.Ukraine has used uncrewed navy drones packed with explosives to attack Russian warships to try to drive them out of parts of the Black Sea, making it possible for Ukraine to open a shipping corridor along a traditionally key export route.Ukraine has no large naval ships left and deliberately scuttled its own flagship at the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion to prevent it falling into Russian hands.Newly developed naval drones have been vital for Ukraine as it tries to narrow the vast gap in its naval capabilities with Russia which has a powerful Black Sea Fleet that Kyiv has been trying to degrade.A senior U.S. State Department official said the use of drones was “an asymmetrical way to rebalance the security picture in the Black Sea” and was helping grow Ukraine’s economy to sustain the war effort.“The fact that the Russian navy cannot operate in the Black Sea at will, compared to how it could operate at the beginning of this war, is a fundamental shift in the strategic position in the Black Sea region,” the official told reporters, requesting anonymity.A senior Ukrainian security official said in December that it had already destroyed 20% of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Ukrainian Navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk said that Russia had five remaining large landing ships in the Black Sea.The Ukrainian military says that it has “destroyed” 25 Russian military vessels and ships and one submarine during the war to date. Last month, Ukrainian cruise missiles struck another large Russian landing warship in Crimea.(Reporting by Pavel Polityuk and Tom Balmforth; Additional reporting by Yuliia Dysa in Gdansk, Oleksandr Kozhukhar in Kyiv and Simon Lewis in Washington; Editing by Nick Macfie and Jonathan Oatis)","February 14, 2024 - 21:01"
279,Pesticide-free but not organic: Swiss offer alternative to wean agriculture off chemicals ,"Three years ago, pesticides took centre stage in Swiss political discourse. Under the country’s direct democracy system, citizens had the opportunity to vote for a complete ban on the use of pesticides and make the Alpine nation a 100% organic-farming oasis. However, when the votes were counted in June 2021, the pesticide initiative failed to win a majority, with only 40% in favour. The Swiss people were not ready for a revolution just yet.  But a quiet revolution was already under way. Since 2019, the Swiss Association of Farmers Practising Integrated Agriculture (IP-Suisse), a sustainable farming movement with a membership of about 18,500, has offered a 30% premium for member farmers who grew wheat without resorting to pesticides but did not go organic. This includes no restrictions on the use of fertilisers. The price premium of the scheme, among the first of its kind in Europe, is mainly supported by Switzerland’s largest supermarket chain, Migros.  The Swiss government is also encouraging non-organic but pesticide-free farming. In 2023, it committed to reducing the harmful environmental effects of pesticides by half by 2027. To achieve this target, the government has restricted the use of hazardous chemicals and introduced direct payments to farmers who voluntarily adopt pesticide-reduced and pesticide-free but non-organic cultivation. These payments can range from CHF650 ($712) per hectare of wheat to CHF1,400 per hectare of rapeseed.  “It is not about enforcing a ban but giving farmers the option to do it if it makes sense to them and if consumers and taxpayers are willing to compensate them,” says Robert Finger, a professor of agricultural economics and policy at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich.  IP-Suisse estimates that in 2022 the share of pesticide-free (but non-organic) wheat cultivation of the total acreage of Swiss wheat was about 15%. Depending on the extent of yield loss involved, modelling shows

that by 2027 adoption of this kind of farming by farmers could potentially make up between 41-79% of total arable land in Switzerland.  “The introduction of pesticide-free food as a third product category would provide consumers with a wider product range. The products have a higher level of sustainability compared to conventional products and are less price-intensive than organic products,” states a study
External link
published in 2024 that polled nearly 600 German consumers. The survey shows consumers were willing to pay between 38.3% to 93.7% more for such hybrid products.  Pesticide exposure has been linked to various forms of cancer, neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, impaired child development and reproductive problems. According to the Swiss Federal Office of the Environment, concentrations of pesticides in groundwater do not exceed the maximum limit of 0.1 micrograms per litre in 98% of monitoring stations. But the legacy of pesticide use can linger in the environment for decades afterwards due to the chemicals released after degradation known as metabolites. This includes metabolites of banned pesticides like atrazine and dichlobenil. Nationwide, every third monitoring site shows metabolite concentrations in excess of the maximum limit of 0.1 μg/L.  Pesticide-free cultivation is not without risks in yield loss even with the use of fertilisers. In temperate regions, where most of the studies have been done, the average yield loss has been estimated to be about 6%. But the loss could be higher in unfavourable production locations.  “If it works for farmers and consumers in a specific region, that’s great. But the situation is different in tropical zones where pests are vigorous and crops can be destroyed overnight,” says Virginia Lee, a spokesperson for CropLife International, a lobby group that represent companies that manufacture plant protection products.  According to Lee, the focus should be on growing as much food as possible on available land sustainably. She advocates striking the right balance between productivity, climate and biodiversity that is appropriate for each agroclimatic zone.  Swiss-based agricultural giant Syngenta, a member of CropLife International, agrees. The multinational does not want to eliminate pesticides from the farmer’s toolbox altogether.  “There has been a lot of innovation in chemistry to make pesticides more efficient. We’ve gone from applying kilograms per hectare to grams per hectare and developments in pesticide application technology are also further helping reduce use,” says Ioana Tudor, Global Head of Crop Protection Marketing at Syngenta. The Swiss farming community is also on the fence regarding the practical aspect of transitioning to pesticide-free cultivation.  “This approach is interesting in theory. In practice, however, there are some problems with consistent implementation,” says Swiss Farmers’ Union spokesperson Sandra Helfenstein. “For example, there is not a good biological control method for every disease or pest in arable farming. This is the reason why organic farming in arable crops is not getting off the ground.  Fertilisation is the smaller problem here”. While manufacturers of agrochemicals and farmers are not fully on board with the pesticide-free trend, organic-farming supporters feel the middle path is not enough to protect the environment. “The problem with fertilisers is not the same as those caused by pesticides. They affect the environment in different ways,” says Raphaël Charles of the Swiss-based Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL). “Fertiliser use releases nitrous oxide into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas.  Application also causes changes in the life cycle of many organisms, including flora, and eutrophication of non-agricultural zones”.  Charles is in favour of other alternatives to synthetic fertilisers, such as using nitrogen fixing plants or recycling organic waste in digesters to produce compost or digestates. “Yes, we get less yield in organic farming, but is conventional agriculture not overproduction when we consider the soil, environment and planet at our disposal?” he says. Ultimately the success of pesticide-free farming hinges on financial support. The yield may be more than that of purely organic farming, but it is still considerably less than it would be if farmers could use all the tools at their disposal, including pesticides. For example, farm trials carried out between 2019 and 2021 showed yields of 7.5 tonnes per hectare for conventional wheat production compared to 6.5 tonnes with the pesticide-free, non-organic method. Investing in mechanical control of weeds also requires farmers to put money up front. They also have to treat the field more often, hire more labour and spend more money on fuel for farm machinery.  “If using no pesticides was profitable on its own, then farmers would be doing it already,” says Finger, who recently published a review on European pesticide-free initiatives in the journal Nature
External link
. “Support from industry and government is needed to encourage a long-term commitment to change the production system. The price markup and government direct payments give farmers the confidence to switch.” Like Switzerland, the German government started compensating farmers that forego synthetic pesticides from 2023. Smaller private initiatives have also sprung up, such as the KraichgauKorn cereal cooperative in Baden Württemberg, Germany, and in Brittany, France, where a few cooperatives have launched a “pesticide-free” label for tomatoes.  The appetite for such voluntary “middle path” initiatives is growing in Europe. However, the scrapping of the European Union’s Green Deal proposal earlier this year to halve the use of pesticides by 2030, following farmer protests, has shown that a top-down ban is unlikely to work.  “It is one option to start removing one or other input, fertilisers or pesticides, according to the context, and then start looking at the whole system later on. It could be a transition phase that could work in the current political climate,” says organic farming expert Charles. Edited by Virginie Mangin/gw","May 2, 2024 - 09:00"

281,EBRD and IFC to provide $435 million for Ukraine’s newly merged telecoms firm,"By Olena HarmashKYIV (Reuters) – The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation will fund Ukraine’s newly merged telecoms company with $435 million, the lenders said on Thursday.The project is the largest direct foreign investment of the war unleashed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.A consortium of investors led by French billionaire Xavier Niel announced last month the completion of a transaction to acquire and merge Ukraine’s Lifecell mobile operator with the country’s Datagroup-Volia service provider.The EBRD and IFC will each provide $217.5 million to help finance the acquisition, Holger Muent, EBRD’s director of telecommunications, media and technology, told Reuters.“That is the game changer,” he said in an interview online, confirming earlier plans to make the investment.“It will create the second-largest operator of that kind in the country and that leads to higher speed, better coverage, lower energy consumption for the network, and more redundancy in the network as well.”Ukraine’s largest telecoms provider is Kyivstar, which is owned by the Amsterdam-listed VEON.The consortium is led by NJJ, a French telecoms investment holding company owned by Niel. NJJ has partnered with Horizon Capital, a leading Ukraine-based private equity fund, and Mykhailo Shelemba, former CEO of Datagroup-Volia, now CEO of the newly merged group.‘REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT’ TO UKRAINETo mitigate risks, a portion of the EBRD’s and IFC’s loans is being covered by guarantees provided by the government of France and the European Commission.“By strengthening digital connectivity and network resilience, we are delivering a vital service to millions of Ukrainians while reaffirming our commitment to the country,” said Makhtar Diop, IFC’s managing director.“It sends a strong message to global investors about the resilience and significant potential of Ukraine’s economy.”The invasion has battered the Ukrainian economy, sending millions of people fleeing as cities and infrastructure are regularly bombed. The Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) estimates that Ukraine’s losses from the war total $1.164 trillion.The economy contracted by around a third in 2022, the first year of the full-scale invasion, before returning to modest growth.The KSE research estimated that indirect financial losses sustained by digital infrastructure and the IT sector stood at $19.3 billion. In addition to damaged infrastructure and lost revenue, Ukrainian telecoms companies have suffered additional losses due to myriad challenges in the energy sector.Russia stepped up its bombardments of Ukrainian power infrastructure in March, disabling half the country’s available generating capacity and causing regular, long blackouts for millions of people.EBRD’s Muent said the merged company would be more resilient to power outages since part of the data traffic from its mobile network could pass through fibre optic cables, consuming less energy. He also pointed to the sector’s growth potential with Ukraine looking to modernize and rebuild its economy.In nearly 32 months of war, the EBRD has provided more than 4.8 billion euros ($5.26 billion) to Ukraine. IFC has invested $1.6 billion, including more than $1.1 billion of its own funds and $530 million mobilized from other investors.($1 = 0.9130 euros)","October 10, 2024 - 07:11"
282,UBS Banker’s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate Finance,"(Bloomberg) — Judson Berkey didn’t hold back.It was early February and the UBS Group AG banker had WebEx-dialed into a meeting held on the 17th floor of the Japanese Financial Services Agency’s building in the Kasumigaseki district of central Tokyo. The closed-door gathering with representatives of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and public officials from around the world was billed as a “check-in” for regulators to ask key market participants how they were dealing with the growing tapestry of rules and guidelines around transitioning the economy away from high-carbon assets.What might otherwise have been a staid conference took an unexpected turn as Berkey, group head of engagement and regulatory strategy at UBS, interjected. The finance industry was being asked to align loans, investments and capital-markets portfolios with a global warming trajectory of 1.5C, while the planet may in fact be hurtling toward a 2.8C increase from pre-industrial times, he noted.The upshot: The world’s biggest banks can’t live up to the green regulatory ideal unless they start dumping huge numbers of clients worldwide at a reckless pace and also roil economies in large swathes of the globe that primarily rely on dirty fuels. Faced with that dilemma, many lenders are quietly reeling in their climate ambitions.“Banks are living and lending on planet earth, not planet NGFS,” Berkey told the group in an impassioned speech, alluding to the Network for Greening the Financial System, a collection of central bankers that creates model scenarios for how the energy transition may evolve. Details of what transpired at the meeting hosted by the Financial Stability Board — a coordinator of global regulations — came from people who were in the room but asked not to be named discussing private talks. Berkey confirmed his participation, declining to say more.Never miss an episode. Follow the  Big Take  podcast on  iHeart ,  Apple Podcasts ,  Spotify  or wherever you listen.  Read the transcript .The UBS banker’s outburst, which got little pushback from those present, exposes the cracks emerging in a multitrillion-dollar transition finance project, and taps into what’s rapidly becoming one of the most contentious issues in the global banking industry. In private, senior bankers in sustainable finance divisions in London, New York, Toronto and Paris grumble about unrealistic expectations from regulators, civil society and climate activists around the industry’s role in getting the planet to net zero.The standoff that’s brewing is setting the stage for a showdown at the heart of the ESG movement, where environmental, social and governance considerations are being pitted against old-fashioned capitalism. As the gatekeepers of capital, banks can play a central role as catalysts for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Private capital will need to cough up the lion’s share of the $5 trillion to $10 trillion in annual commitments needed to pay for the green transition, and according to hedge fund billionaire Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, that will only happen if there’s “a return on the money.” “You have to make it profitable,” he told delegates at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in December.Climate change is “an economic externality, and you can’t expect a free market to deal with it voluntarily,” Adair Turner, who ran Britain’s financial regulator during the subprime and euro-zone debt crises and is now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, said in an interview. Most of the transition away from high-carbon activities toward greener business models “will be financed by private institutions making, broadly speaking, profit-maximizing decisions,” he said.  Banks that had enthusiastically committed to align their entire operations with net zero goals are having second thoughts as the real-world ramifications of acting on those pledges become painfully apparent.  For instance, doing business in the energy sectors of coal-dependent countries like South Africa, Poland and Indonesia would be off limits. Not only do the commitments make it harder for banks to serve commodities clients like Glencore Plc, but even companies not always associated with heavy carbon footprints are ending up in the crosshairs. Nvidia Corp., the wildly successful tech colossus, has an implied temperature rise of 4C and cosmetics giant L’Oreal SA is at an eye-popping 6C, meaning their business models are currently aligned with a trajectory of devastating global warming, according to data compiled by Morningstar Inc.“Our net zero commitments are about being our clients’ lead partner and are consciously taken around the idea that we need to be there with our clients and our clients need to succeed, not that we need to hyper select clients in order to get to net zero somehow faster or better,” Jonathan Hackett, head of sustainable finance at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview.Some of the world’s biggest lenders, including Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of America Corp., are adding caveats to their restrictions on financing coal, the planet’s most-polluting energy source.BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink says he has stopped using the term ESG and emphasized the world’s largest asset manager’s work with energy firms in a letter to investors this week. The firm has scaled back its participation in international climate investing alliances.In its sustainability report published on Thursday, UBS referred to a “notable shift in emphasis” in discussions around climate change. After years spent on net zero pledges, there’s now a greater recognition of the need for a transition phase, and going forward high inflation and input costs will be “key considerations” for clients developing strategies to decarbonize, the Swiss bank said.In February, a string of financial heavyweights, including JPMorgan Asset Management, Pacific Investment Management Co. and State Street Global Advisors, withdrew from Climate Action 100+, the world’s largest investor group formed to fight global warming. Lenders, including HSBC, decided to withdraw applications to get their climate goals certified by the United Nations-backed Science Based Targets initiative. Other such voluntary climate alliances have been shaken by similar walkouts of late. Spokespeople for the firms said the moves didn’t reflect a reduced commitment to climate finance. Behind the scenes, people close to the decisions to exit point to the inconvenience of continued membership, spanning everything from the risk of being sued by anti-ESG agitators in the US — especially in the event former President Donald Trump returns to the White House — to the growing mountain of paperwork associated with upholding climate targets. There’s also lost revenue.“For banks with substantial capital markets businesses, like those competing with the JPMorgans of the world, it’s fee income that’s on the line here,” said James Vaccaro, Chief Catalyst at Climate Safe Lending Network, a group that helps the finance industry figure out how to cut its carbon footprint. “Ditching clients off track from 1.5C means losing major lines of revenue.” When climate consciousness erupted onto the financial stage in 2021 at the so-called COP26 summit in Glasgow, major western banks clamorously committed to reduce their carbon footprints. Financed emissions — those that arise from lending and investing — would fall in line with a pathway to achieve net zero by 2050, they pledged. In tandem, most of them promised to pour a big chunk of money — anywhere between $750 billion and $2.5 trillion per bank — into green and sustainable deals by the end of this decade. But all that was before they had rolled up their sleeves and done the math. Declarations of intent on slashing greenhouse gas emissions “over projected” what the industry could do, said Adam Matthews, chief responsible investment officer for the Church of England Pensions Board. There’s now a “gradual peeling away of flaky members as the penny has dropped that this is much harder than a photo call and press release,” he said.Inside the finance industry, irritation hit a new level after the publication of an ECB paper in January stating that 90% of the euro-zone banks it analyzed are “misaligned” with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The central bank called this a “staggering” outcome.The ECB noted that many banks depend largely on clients in energy-intensive sectors for revenue. It looked at six industries — power, automotive, oil and gas, steel, coal and cement. On average, these exposures amount to 15% of their highest-quality capital, although the ECB cited “significant variation among banks.” In other words, widespread losses on loans to high-carbon sectors would probably wipe out a large chunk of banks’ financial reserves.Defining what can go under the rubric of the green transition remains a work-in-progress, even as lenders including Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA and Citigroup Inc. create new investment and corporate banking teams for it. In some cases, banks are even placing the financing of coal plants under an ESG banner. Lenders are looking for ways to hold on to clients in an array of high-emitting industries spanning cement to shipping and aviation. HSBC has made clear that many clients within these industries will only reach net zero if nascent carbon-reduction technologies can be sufficiently scaled up. Coal has tended to face the tightest financing restrictions of all fossil fuels, and international packages to help developing countries transition away from coal have struggled to attract western bankers concerned their involvement would breach their climate policies.Now, some banks are testing the waters.A January request for proposals from banks to help finance a coal deal linked to one of the so-called Just Energy Transition Partnerships in Indonesia received a “strong response,” a spokesperson for the Asian Development Bank told Bloomberg. HSBC, Standard Chartered Plc and Bank of America are among lenders that have pitched for the deal that would finance the early closure of the Cirebon-1 coal-fired power station in West Java, Bloomberg has reported. The only way the banks can do that is by expanding their exposure to coal in the medium term.Cirebon is one of hundreds of coal-fired plants that power homes and industry across Asia. Unlike in the US or Europe, many coal plants in Asia are still just a few years into an estimated lifespan of roughly four decades. They’re also locked into long-term power agreements and have investors who expect the returns they were promised when they allocated funds to the plants. So shutting them early comes at a significant financial cost.“Getting to net zero in time won’t be possible unless we all work together to find ways to finance the credible early retirement of Asia’s relatively young coal power assets, even if it looks like our coal-related emissions go up in the short term,” said Celine Herweijer, HSBC’s chief sustainability officer. “This is about avoided real world emissions.”The bank published an updated coal policy in January, which shows it now applies a “risk-based approach” to coal projects that might otherwise have been excluded. Herweijer said there’s work under way in the industry to separately account for coal-related emissions if they’re the result of financing credible early-coal retirement initiatives.But some global banks and investors say continued ties with coal just isn’t worth the risk.“It’s a bit of a slippery slope,” said Thibaud Clisson, climate lead at BNP Paribas Asset Management. The world needs to “get rid of coal as soon as possible, so at this stage, we don’t want to take this opportunity to be less strict,” he said.Alice Carr, executive director of public policy at the world’s biggest climate finance coalition, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ, says “financial institutions are considering how to do these kinds of [early coal retirement] transactions presently, and we need the right guardrails because there’s a lot of reputational risk if you don’t get them right.” GFANZ is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is the chair of Bloomberg Inc.’s board and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.For Climate Safe Lending’s Vaccaro, it’s how banks go about it that’s important. The opportunity to pivot to green financing is “big enough” to offset some of the lost revenue of dirty clients, but banks are unlikely to seize it if they continue with their “doublespeak” on both embracing sustainability and maintaining business as usual, he said.Climate activists are worried. Experience suggests that banks and investors “love nothing better than a good policy loophole,” said Paddy McCully, senior energy transition analyst at French climate nonprofit Reclaim Finance. “If one exists, the chances are high they will pour some money through it.”Meanwhile, investors sticking with carbon-heavy assets say those staying away risk ignoring the real issues in the wider economy.Many current policies restricting investment in such companies “create a bias” that hurts emerging markets, according to Diana Guzman, chief sustainability officer at Prudential Plc. “Divestment isn’t going to be the solution,” said Fumitaka Nakahama, group head of global corporate and investment banking at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.As they balance the needs of their clients against their green commitments, veterans of global finance say they want regulators to be honest and acknowledge that progress on climate is slow, and that without the right incentives, bankers won’t play the role expected of them. “It was always convenient for finance to be projected as the savior on climate, when in reality, finance can only go so far if the enabling policy environment isn’t there,” according to the Church of England Pensions Board’s Matthews.That was the point UBS’s Berkey made during the Tokyo meeting, and according to those who were in the room, when he had finished speaking, everyone could see “the wheels turning” in the regulators’ heads.–With assistance from Nicholas Comfort.(Adds details from UBS’s sustainability report published Thursday and updates comment by GFANZ’s Carr.

283,UBS Bankers Under Pressure From Lawyers to Rethink ESG Labels,"(Bloomberg) — UBS Group AG is asking its bankers to rethink the way they discuss some sustainable products in public following advice from its lawyers, according to people familiar with the matter.The development affects the kind of language bankers are free to use when presenting a whole array of topics spanning net-zero goals to individual transactions for clients, the people said asking not to be identified revealing internal deliberations. Specific products such as debt-for-nature swaps are among those affected by the heightened level of legal anxiety, one of the people said.A spokesperson for UBS declined to comment.The decision to rein in the use of certain ESG (environmental, social, governance) product labels and claims at UBS coincides with a wider shift inside the finance industry, as regulators in Europe churn out stricter rules and the number of activist lawsuits increases. In the US, meanwhile, ESG labels risk triggering the ire of Republican lawmakers intent on banning the financial strategy outright.The guidance at UBS is designed to ensure the bank isn’t accused of greenwashing or seen to be non-compliant with emerging regulations, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The alternative language that lawyers are coming up with is replacing shorthand descriptions that have become the norm in the market. For example, in the case of debt-for-nature swaps — which are intended to help governments refinance debt and then put savings toward conservation — lawyers at UBS are asking bankers to instead refer to the products as Country Debt Conversion With Associated Sustainable Development Goal Funding, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.“You have to speak in longer sentences if you want to fully convey what you’re talking about,” said Anna-Marie Slot, co-founder of advisory firm Transition Value Partners and a former partner for global sustainability at law firm Ashurst. “It doesn’t look as nice in your marketing brochure, but it’s the reality of regulated financial firms that they need to be able to explain and defend what they’re doing.”The market for debt-for-nature swaps was dominated by Credit Suisse before the bank’s takeover by UBS last year. The change in guidance around nomenclature hasn’t affected UBS’s plans to pursue such deals, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Though accepted in general market parlance, lawyers advising UBS expressed concern that the debt-for-nature-swap label is imprecise and could expose the bank to legal risk, the person said. The sustainability impact of the instruments can be difficult to document, the person said. Also, the label implies that such products function like derivatives such as interest-rate swaps, the person said. Typically, banks in the nascent market for such deals have tended to refer to them as debt conversions in client-facing documents. Before its takeover by UBS, Credit Suisse referred to a 2022 deal with Barbados as a debt-conversion-for-marine-conservation, a label it used again for a subsequent 2023 deal for Ecuador.Credit Suisse also adapted to guidance to stop referring to the bonds used in transactions targeting marine conservation as “blue,” to make clear that the instruments don’t follow the same use-of-proceeds structure as green bonds. On the separate matter of “net zero,” UBS is reviewing the bank’s use of the term, in large part due to the passage of the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, one of the people said. A key plank of CSDDD requires large firms to introduce transition plans that are aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5C from pre-industrial levels, a goal that many in the finance industry now fear is unrealistic.UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said in April that the bank prioritizes its own sustainability framework over Credit Suisse’s, given what he referred to as its “broader application across sectors and generally stronger risk mitigants.” In connection with its takeover of Credit Suisse, UBS appointed Beatriz Martin to oversee sustainability, which she’ll combine with her existing role as head of non-core and legacy operations. The way in which financial firms talk about sustainability is “going from a phrase that pops up nicely on social media to a sentence on what it is you intend to do, and what dependencies you have in delivering on it,” Slot said.–With assistance from Natasha White and Jeff Black.(Adds reference to JPMorgan deal.)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","October 21, 2024 - 08:07"
284,Embezzled funds test Swiss-Moldovan relations,"On October 20, Moldovans will vote on whether their country should join the European Union. The Moldovan population has ties to both Western Europe and Russia. The stakes are high for this small country, and it could be a decisive turning point.Amid this uncertainty, Switzerland has positioned itself as an important ally for Chisinau. The two countries have much in common and, for years, Switzerland has made considerable efforts to support Moldova.However, this commitment is beset by contradictions, particularly when it comes to the confiscation of assets of corrupt former politicians. Authorities in Chisinau had to wait four years before Swiss authorities confiscated the Geneva villa belonging to oligarch Vladimir Plahotniuc. The villa is valued at over CHF30 million ($35 million).Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Republic of Moldova has also become the focus of European attention. According to the newspaper Le Temps, Switzerland has redoubled its efforts in the form of diplomatic “hyperactivity”.In 2024, Switzerland doubled its financial support for the Republic of Moldova to CHF25 million. This decision, confirmed by foreign minister Ignazio Cassis, was just one of many outreach gestures. Within a period of two years, there were no fewer than four official meetings between the two countries. The high point was the state visit of the Moldovan President Maia Sandu in Bern in October 2023. She was received by four members of the government, including then-President Alain Berset.However, there is a dark side to this diplomatic honeymoon that casts a shadow over Swiss-Moldovan collaboration. Switzerland’s financial community has long been a refuge for funds embezzled by corrupt former Moldovan politicians. The most symbolic case is that of Vladimir Plahotniuc, a three-term member of parliament and one-time “strong man” of Moldovan politics.Until 2019, Plahotniuc was seen as the real power player in the country, controlling the government, the parliamentary majority and the judiciary, as well as sustaining a pro-European orientation.An unexpected alliance between pro-European and pro-Russian powers made it possible to remove him from power. This alliance was united in its opposition to what was perceived as arbitrary power.Plahotniuc is now on the run and is subject to international sanctions. According to the Swiss government, he has “jeopardised or threatened democracy, the rule of law, stability or security in the Republic of Moldova”.In a recent exposé, Le Temps reported on a significant development in his case. A ruling of the Federal Criminal Court published on September 24 notes that the luxury villa in Geneva, which officially belongs to Plahotniuc’s wife, has finally been confiscated.Although this brings the four-year wait for Moldova to an end, it will still take some time for the villa to be sold. Only then will the Moldovan government be able to recover the embezzled funds. At CHF30 million, the villa is worth more than the yearly financial support Switzerland sends to Moldova.The discrepancy between the demonstrative diplomatic support for Moldova and the slow progress of the justice system is evident in another case – that of Vlad Filat, a former Moldovan prime minister.In 2015, Moldova requested Switzerland’s help in an investigation of Filat, who was suspected of receiving around CHF260 million in bribes.That year an astronomical sum of money disappeared from three Moldovan banks. This became known in Moldova as the ‘Scam of the Century’, and it brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy.Filat has close ties to Switzerland. His children attended a prestigious school on Lake Geneva and his ex-wife lived near Geneva. Almost ten years after the request for assistance, the legal process has still not led to the seizure and return of the stolen funds to the Republic of Moldova.Moldovan state lawyers recently filed another request to Switzerland for the return of CHF4.4 million. Valeriu Triboi, a former deputy economics minister, also accused of embezzlement, is alleged to have hidden this money in Switzerland.The Swiss foreign ministry defends its efforts to improve legal cooperation with Moldova.A ministry spokesperson told SWI swissinfo.ch that it “has facilitated consultations between the Moldovan Ministry of Justice and the International Centre for Asset Recovery (ICAR), based in Basel”. He added that “a project to support Moldova’s ability to confiscate and recover illicitly acquired assets is currently being prepared as part of the Swiss cooperation programme”.Switzerland is aware “that the issues of fighting corruption and confiscating assets are very important for the Moldovan government, and we recognise the government’s efforts in this regard”, the spokesperson added.The ministry went on to say that the government is currently “preparing a project aimed at strengthening trust, integrity and compliance between small and medium-sized enterprises and the Moldovan public sector, as well as within these branches”.Regarding the specific cases of Plahotniuc, Filat and Triboi, the ministry referred SWI swissinfo.ch to the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG), which in turn referred SWI to the authorities in Chisinau.For his part, Vladimir Cuc, the Moldovan ambassador in Geneva, expressed gratitude and optimism.He told SWI swissinfo.ch that bilateral relations between his country and Switzerland have always been “friendly and positive. After Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine […] the Swiss authorities have indeed intensified their political and financial support for the Republic of Moldova”.The ambassador recognises that the issue of repatriating misappropriated assets is an important topic. “We usually raise the issue of asset repatriation at various levels, and I know that it has also been raised at the highest level in the past,” he said.Despite the extended wait, Cuc considers judicial cooperation to be functioning. “Sometimes we want to see results and feedback more quickly, which is natural for Moldova as an affected party, but we also understand how important it is that all procedures are followed,” he said.In the run-up to the October 20 referendum, relations between Switzerland and Moldova are also at a crossroads. Not only the outcome of the referendum, but also the way in which Switzerland reacts to it, both diplomatically and legally, could shape the future of relations between these two small countries.Edited by Benjamin von Wyl.

285,Nations strike deal at COP28 to transition away from fossil fuels,"By Valerie Volcovici, Gloria Dickie and William JamesDUBAI (Reuters) -Representatives from nearly 200 countries agreed at the COP28 climate summit on Wednesday to begin reducing global consumption of fossil fuels to avert the worst of climate change, signalling the eventual end of the oil age.The deal struck in Dubai after two weeks of hard-fought negotiations was meant to send a powerful message to investors and policy-makers that the world is united in its desire to break with fossil fuels, something scientists say is the last best hope to stave off climate catastrophe.COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber called the deal “historic” but added that its true success would be in its implementation.“We are what we do, not what we say,” he told the crowded plenary at the summit. “We must take the steps necessary to turn this agreement into tangible actions.”Several countries cheered the deal for accomplishing something that until now eluded decades of climate talks.“It is the first time that the world unites around such a clear text on the need to transition away from fossil fuels,” Norway’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide said.More than 100 countries had lobbied hard for strong language in the COP28 agreement to “phase out” oil, gas and coal use, but came up against powerful opposition from the Saudi Arabia-led oil producer group OPEC, which said the world can cut emissions without shunning specific fuels.That battle pushed the summit a full day into overtime on Wednesday, and had some observers worried the negotiations would end at an impasse.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries control nearly 80% of the world’s proven oil reserves along with about a third of global oil output, and their governments rely heavily on those revenues.Small climate-vulnerable island states, meanwhile, were among the most vocal supporters of language to phase out fossil fuels and had the backing of major oil and gas producers such as the United States, Canada and Norway, as well as the European Union and scores of other governments.“This is a moment where multilateralism has actually come together and people have taken individual interests and attempted to define the common good,” U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said after the deal was adopted.The lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, Anne Rasmussen, criticised the deal as unambitious.“We have made an incremental advancement over business as usual, when what we really need is an exponential step change in our actions,” she said.But she did not formally object to the pact, and her speech drew a standing ovation that lasted nearly two minutes.Danish Minister for Climate and Energy Dan Jorgensen marvelled at the circumstances of the deal: “We’re standing here in an oil country, surrounded by oil countries, and we made the decision saying let’s move away from oil and gas.”EMISSIONS REDUCTIONThe deal calls for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner … so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science.”To some extent, that language describes what has already begun to happen, with some governments enacting policies in recent years to transition to a greener economy.Europe and the U.S. have retired fleets of coal-fired power plants; global installation of renewable power capacity is at record levels and many countries have policies to encourage sales of electric vehicles.The deal calls on governments to accelerate that – specifically by tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, speeding up efforts to reduce coal use, and accelerating technologies such as carbon capture and storage that can clean up hard-to-decarbonise industries.A source familiar with Saudi Arabia’s position described the deal as “a menu where every country can follow its own pathway,” saying it “shows the various tracks that will allow us to maintain the objective of 1.5 (degrees Celsius) in accordance with the characteristics of every nation and in the context of sustainable development.”Several other oil producer countries, including the summit host UAE, had advocated for a role for carbon capture in the pact. Critics say the technology remains expensive and unproven at scale, and say it can be used to justify continued drilling.Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore also welcomed the deal, but said: “The influence of petrostates is still evident in the half measures and loopholes included in the final agreement.”Now that the deal is struck, countries are responsible for delivering through national policies and investments.China, the world’s biggest carbon polluter today, suggested that industrialised countries should lead the way.“Developed countries have unshirkable historical responsibilities for climate change,” the country’s vice environment minister Zhao Yingmin said after the pact was approved.In the United States, the world’s top producer of oil and gas and the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, climate-conscious administrations have struggled to pass laws aligned with their climate vows through a divided Congress.U.S. President Joe Biden scored a major victory last year with passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which contained hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy subsidies.Mounting public support for renewables and electric vehicles from Brussels to Beijing in recent years, along with improving technology, sliding costs, and rising private investment have also driven rapid growth in their deployments.Even so, oil, gas, and coal account for about 80% of the world’s energy, and projections vary widely about when global demand will finally hit its peak.Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, praised the climate deal, but said it does not commit rich countries to offer more financing to help developing countries pay for the transition away from fossil fuels.“The finance and equity provisions… are seriously insufficient and must be improved in the time ahead in order to ensure low- and middle-income countries can transition to clean energy and close the energy poverty gap,” she said.For daily comprehensive coverage on COP28 in your inbox, sign up for the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter here(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici, Gloria Dickie, William James, Sarah McFarlane, Kate Abnett, Jake Spring, Elizabeth Piper, David Stanway and Simon Jessop; Editing by Richard Valdmanis, Katy Daigle, Gerry Doyle, Sharon Singleton and Barbara Lewis)","December 13, 2023 - 18:07"

287,Exclusive-New Zealand proposes 6.6% smaller defence budget amid personnel and equipment woes,"By Lucy Craymer and Lewis JacksonWELLINGTON (Reuters) – New Zealand’s proposed defence budget will be 6.6% smaller than the current year’s, according to the defence minister’s office, even as the armed forces struggle with ageing equipment, a shortage of manpower and ambitions for a greater regional role.According to previously unreported data, provided to Reuters by the defence minister, the proposed defence budget will fall to NZ$4.95 billion ($3.03 billion) for the year that ends in June 2025. This year’s defence budget was NZ$5.3 billion.The new budget, to be presented on May 30, would put New Zealand’s defence spending at 0.9% of GDP, down from 1% in the current year, according to the defence force.The drop in budgeted spending comes as recent government reports have warned about old equipment, and the military has struggled to hire and retain personnel. Alongside those challenges, the government wants to improve the state of the country’s armed forces and take on more regional and global missions – as well as investigate a bid to join the AUKUS defence pact.“I have been consistently clear that Defence will need more funding and am committed to supporting Defence,” Defence Minister Judith Collins told Reuters in an email, adding that big decisions on capital spending would be made after the completion of a Defence Capability Plan in June.The country’s Finance Ministry presents the government budget, which parliament must approve. Finance Minister Nicola Willis said in an email that the government had announced NZ$571 million of new defence spending over the next four years.The ministry said that it was not cutting existing spending, as the current defence budget was boosted by large capital expenditures on new aircraft, and that future capital investment decisions were “still under consideration”.Many of New Zealand’s traditional partners, such as Australia and Japan, are ramping up spending in response to China’s growing military presence in the region.Japan, which spent roughly 1% of GDP on defence as recently as 2022, will hit about 1.6% next year and aims to reach 2% by 2028. Australia will go from 2% to around 2.4% over the next decade.New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has worked hard to increase international engagement since taking office, including sending a maritime security team to the Red Sea. But falling revenue and rising debt have hamstrung the country’s ability to boost defence spending even as it says it is concerned about China’s growing presence in the Pacific and a worsening global security environment.“The government has made it clear that it wants to spend more on defence and be seen to be doing more in the defence space, but decades of sustained underinvestment mean chickens are coming home to roost,” said David Capie, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University. “It’s not going to be fixed in one budget; it’s going to take significant and sustained investment over a long period of time.” The government has said it wants to cut spending on average by 6.5% to 7.5% across all agencies.Three of the Royal New Zealand Navy’s nine ships are already stuck in port for want of crew. The Air Force’s Boeing 757-2K2s regularly break down, and in March, Luxon had to take a commercial jet to an ASEAN summit after his plane was grounded.New Zealand also had to ask other countries for help with maritime surveillance and regional search rescue operations after retiring its P-3K2 Orions five months early because of staff shortages.In February, outgoing Chief of Defence Air Marshal Kevin Short estimated that the country was just over NZ$5 billion behind in defence spending from where it was projected to be in the 2019 Defence Capability Plan.He told a parliament committee this year that “readiness continues to be one of the New Zealand Defence Force’s greatest challenge”.AUKUS UNLIKELYNew Zealand’s lagging military spending and ability will damage its chances of joining a technology-focused part of the AUKUS defence pact, diplomatic sources say. The government is in the midst of discussions on what joining would entail.Australia, Britain and the United States signed the pact in 2021. At its core is a plan to help Australia build nuclear-powered submarines, but a second stage to develop other military technology, such as hypersonic missiles, is open to more countries. Both South Korea and Japan have expressed interest.Diplomatic sources say prospective joiners need to bring money, technology or industrial capacity to the table to justify the extra complexity that comes with adding members.That puts New Zealand at a disadvantage, according to a source in New Zealand government.“You need to show some money,” said a diplomat from an AUKUS country based in Australia. Both sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.“You’ve got to show you’re investing in the industrial base that would make you a useful ally, otherwise you’re adding complexity without benefits,” the source in Australia said.($1 = 1.6329 New Zealand dollars)","May 22, 2024 - 09:58"
288,China objects to US bid for APEC to shift trade and investment principles,"By David LawderSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -China is objecting to a U.S. proposal for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members to incorporate sustainability and inclusivity into their trade and investment policies, a source briefed on the negotiations said on Wednesday.Talks on the issue were continuing at the APEC summit in San Francisco to try to find language that the group’s 21 member states could agree on, the source said.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai told a trade-focused plenary meeting she hoped the proposal, dubbed by the Biden administration as the “San Francisco Principles for Integrating Inclusivity and Sustainability into Trade and Investment Policy” could be still be finalized.Tai said the U.S.-led effort was “supported by all economies but one and, as such, it is unclear if APEC will fulfill that mandate. Nonetheless, I remain optimistic that economies will finalize the San Francisco Principles soon.”Few details of the U.S. proposal were available, but the Biden administration is promoting the idea that APEC economies increase opportunities for more people, particularly disadvantaged populations, and to incorporate clean energy and carbon emissions reductions goals into their development, growth and trade policies.“Our economies are more than just numbers,” Tai said when describing the U.S. proposal. “They are made of people, so we need to make sure that our economic and trade policies work for our people and that the benefits created are shared by all.”Tai is separately seeking to negotiate a green steel arrangement with the European Union that aims to disadvantage Chinese steelmakers on the basis of their higher carbon emissions.News of China’s objections at the APEC summit come as U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met south of San Francisco in high-stakes talks that included discussions between the superpowers over Taiwan and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.A spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington did not directly address China’s objections but said that all APEC parties should “focus on the region’s urgent needs, deepen solidarity and cooperation, deliver on the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040 in an all-round and balanced way,” a reference to declarations by APEC leaders in 2020 in Malaysia.The Putrajaya vision called for working to “deliver a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable trade and investment environment.”(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Jonathan Oatis; Editing by Christopher Cushing)","November 16, 2023 - 01:54"
289,"Soccer-Arnault, Red Bull’s proposed Paris FC takeover set to fix city’s football oddity","By Julien PretotPARIS (Reuters) – Since Paris St Germain were taken over by Qatar Sports Investments just over a decade ago the club has become a symbol of global sports ambition and highlighted the absence of another top-tier club in the city, an oddity in European football.The Arnault family and Red Bull’s proposed investment in Paris FC announced on Thursday is set to give the French capital a second top club to bring the city into line.The Premier League boasts seven London clubs, while the likes of Barcelona, Madrid, Turin, Munich, Manchester, Liverpool and Lisbon each have two historical clubs.Paris FC would become the second French club owned by a billionaire after Kering’s Francois Pinault acquired Stade Rennais in 1998.The Arnault family is expected to bring at least 100 million euros ($108.22 million) to the project, with the possibility of pushing the budget up to 200 million if the club secures a spot in the top flight next season, which would put Paris FC among the top 10, and possibly five, in terms of Ligue 1 budget.The financial muscle will be complemented by Red Bull’s vast expertise in sports management and talent development, having built successful clubs around the world through a unique model that nurtures talent and coordinates a global network.“At least on paper, it’s a marriage made in heaven because it serves a purpose for all the stakeholders who are involved,” sports analysts Simon Chadwick told Reuters on Tuesday.“Red Bull brings 20 to 30 years of proven expertise. They know how to develop sports properties, not just sell energy drinks. Their model has shown success in Salzburg and Leipzig, and Paris FC could be their next big project.”FAN BASEWhile PSG have capitalised on the city’s status as a global capital of fashion, art, and culture, Chadwick noted that the club’s brand was still heavily tied to their Qatari ownership.“For many people in Paris, PSG has become the face of Qatar, not Paris or France,” he explained.“That has left a gap for a club that could truly represent the city and its people. There is a very real appetite for an aspirational, Parisian football club.“Young audiences, especially in Generation Z and Alpha, are more open to new models of football, including franchise-style networks like Red Bull’s.”Paris FC have struggled to find a fan base, with the average attendance last season at just under 5,500 in their 19,000 Charlety stadium despite tickets being free since last November.With a lack of VIP boxes at Charlety, Paris FC might move to the Jean Bouin stadium, home to Top 14 rugby club Stade Francais and situated just a few steps from PSG’s Parc des Princes.It will however soon be time for them to find a sustainable solution.“Paris is a tough city for infrastructure projects,” said Chadwick.“But with the Arnault family’s clout and the support of (French president Emmanuel) Macron, there’s a very real possibility that they can navigate the political hurdles and find a home within the city.“What’s more, this project could create significant economic and social benefits for the city.”Depending on their budget, Paris FC could also challenge the dominance of Olympique Lyonnais and PSG in the French women’s top league.($1 = 0.9240 euros)","October 17, 2024 - 16:45"
290,"Bittersweet Olympic experience for some in Paris suburb, home of Games","By Juliette JabkhiroSAINT-DENIS, France (Reuters) – After enduring years of construction work on the Olympic Village opposite her block of flats, 15-year-old schoolgirl Enda Fofana had hoped for a free ticket to see the Paris 2024 Games. It never materialised.The teenager lives in Seine-Saint-Denis, a gritty, racially mixed suburb reaching northeast away from the capital, where the government and local mayors hope investment in new housing, sports facilities, metro lines and cycle lanes will leave a lasting legacy of urban and economic renewal.The Games’ organisers pledged that Seine-Saint-Denis would be a pulsating focal point of the Paris Olympics, home to the athletes’ village, the Stade de France national stadium and a new 5,000-seat aquatics centre.But Fofana echoed the sentiment of some in the area who complained that Paris 2024 did too little to help them enjoy the Games first hand.“We thought they would plan things for us because, well, it’s the Games, it’s the biggest event in the world,” Fofana said. Her flat’s balcony overlooks the entrance to the Olympic village, her middle school nestled among the buildings.David Lebon, a senior official in the Saint-Denis town hall said all students from Fofana’s middle school had received an invite to a sporting event, and she and her friends took part in the torch relay.Her mother, Ketty Choux-Fofana, said she never saw the invite. She added there had been joyful moments during the Games but cited inconveniences too: longer work commutes because of snarled local roads, heightened police checks and athletes partying under their windows as the Games wound up.Another Saint-Denis resident, Betty Bonheur, expressed disappointment that tickets were unaffordable to many residents in Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest of mainland France’s administrative departments where the unemployment rate is nearly 50% higher than the national average.“I would have liked them to say ‘Here, we’ve got tickets, we can give you some’, to get people involved, to allocate cheaper tickets. That wasn’t the case,” she said.SENSE OF DISCONNECTA Saint-Denis town hall spokesperson said a total of 10,000 opening ceremony invites and 9,000 invites for sports events at the Olympics and Paralympics had been offered to the town’s 114,000 people.Amine Ben Dziri said his daughter was among those fortunate to receive a ticket. She triumphed in a school competition and won a ticket to the athletics.“It was her first time in such a big stadium. It was very nice,” he told Reuters in a local park that had been transformed into a free-to-enter fan zone that was half-full.The Games have delighted vast, jubilant crowds with sporting events held among some of the capital’s most famous landmarks including the Place de la Concorde, Eiffel Tower and Grand Palais – the picture-perfect version of Paris that can seem distant from the hard-knock streets of Saint-Denis.Local officials hope that the Games will have delivered a jolt to the local economy. The Olympic Village that has been home to some 10,500 athletes will be transformed into housing units, including social and student housing.Two of the three new developments the Games will leave behind are located in Seine-Saint-Denis. But some residents told Reuters they questioned the sustainability of wider economic benefits.Mohammed Ydriss Smaali, 21, said he felt the government and local authorities had missed an opportunity to develop job prospects in the area.“Lots of jobs have been created, even if it was only in the short term,” said Smaali. “But no-one did anything, for example, to prioritise the people, the young people who live here.”","August 10, 2024 - 01:37"
291,Hidden wealth: Swiss NGO maps Africa’s undeclared gold flows ,"“There is a lot more that needs to be done to formalise the sector and make sure that African states get a revenue from the trade of this gold,” notes Yvan Schulz, Swissaid raw materials researcher and co-author of the study that combed through the continent’s gold production and trade data country by country.  Switzerland is the second largest importer of African gold after the UAE.In 2022, Africa produced between 991 and 1,144 tonnes of gold, with over half of this coming from artisanal mines. However, a significant amount of ASM gold is not officially recorded in production and trade data. That same year, more than 435 tonnes of gold were smuggled out of Africa, which represents more than a tonne a day, according to the report.Do you want to read our weekly top stories? Subscribe here.Nine countries across the continent see over 20 tonnes of ASM gold go undeclared annually. In 41 out of 54 African nations, ASM gold production exceeds 100kg per year, yet 15 countries fail to report any production at all, the report noted. This hidden treasure accounts for up to 80% of ASM gold production and nearly 41% of Africa’s total gold output.The shadow economy robs African nations of tax revenues that could be invested in development. Schulz says, “We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for the whole continent that would be available for all kinds of public services including health and education.”One of the factors for not declaring gold for export is a very high export tax. “Some of these export taxes are not realistic,” he notes. “If you ask dealers to pay a 15% export tax you can be almost certain that this gold is not going to be declared. One of our recommendations to African states is that they should harmonize their tax regimes.”In other countries, state administration is not keeping up with the scale of the trade. While not a focus of the report, which is based on desk research, state administration and corruption are also part of the problem. “In some countries it’s absolutely clear that the elite have a role to play in the trade of undeclared gold,” says Schulz. “They control the whole trade, nothing gets done without their approval. That’s a form of corruption.”Much of the undeclared gold from the African continent finds its way into international markets through clandestine routes, particularly to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Here, the gold gains legal status, blurring the lines between illicit and legitimate trade. Comparison of import data by Swissaid reveals that Africa’s undeclared ASM gold production could reach the upper estimate of 474 tonnes. The gold smuggled out in 2022 (435 tonnes) corresponds to a value of $30.7 billion at current gold prices (May 1, 2024). “Gold smuggling in Africa more than doubled between 2012 and 2022,” noted Adam Anthony, chairperson of the African steering Committee of Publish What You Pay (PWYP), in reaction to the Swissaid findings, which were first presented at an OECD summit on responsible mineral supply chains this month. “Let me put things into perspective: $30 billion a year is equivalent to two times the GDP of Rwanda and the foreign reserves of Tanzania for the next six months.”The UAE is a major gold hub and a popular destination for gold smugglers. According to the report, around 66.5% of its gold imports from Africa in 2022 were sourced through smuggling. Between 2012 and 2022, 2,569 tonnes of African gold entered the UAE without being declared for export, representing a value of $115.3 billion.The UAE has taken widely recognised steps to tighten regulations on the gold sector in the past couple of years. However, its absence was noted at recent international events focused on responsible gold sourcing, including the OECD event this month and a similarly themed gathering of gold industry actors convened by the London Bullion Market Association in London in March.Switzerland also plays a crucial role in the gold trade network. Alongside the UAE and India, it is one of the top three importers of African gold. From 2012 to 2022, nearly 80% of African gold exports were destined for these three nations. Swiss direct gold imports from Africa increased from 158 tonnes in 2012 to 246 tonnes in 2022, the report noted.Switzerland, South Africa, and India all purchase industrial gold from the African continent.  The UAE stands out as the main destination for ASM gold, receiving 80 to 85% of these exports, according to the same source. South Africa also plays a significant role in intra-African gold trade, being the key destination country for declared gold shipments within the continent.The report highlights that even though Switzerland currently shuns ASM gold from Africa, it is possible for gold from Africa to enter the Swiss market via the UAE. “Switzerland is not directly sourcing ASM gold from Africa, but Switzerland is sourcing a lot of gold from the UAE,” points out Schulz. “Part of that gold very likely comes from Africa and from Africa ASM. So there’s a high risk that Switzerland might actually be sourcing a lot of ASM gold from Africa indirectly.”The reliability of data on Africa’s gold sector is a major issue.  Numerous studies have examined illicit gold flows in Africa, emphasising strong commercial links with the UAE. These investigations used “mirror data analysis” to uncover mismatches in export and import figures.Swissaid explains it also employed mirror data analysis, addressing its limitations by considering factors like differing trade systems, misclassification of tariff codes, and variations in trade value reporting. By cross-checking national customs statistics and trade data, among other sources, Swissaid aimed for accuracy. The study required research and interviews with actors across the global gold industry to round out the information.Marcena Hunter, director of the Extractives at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, commended the report and said it aligned with studies done by her organisation. “It is a really great exploration of the data both in terms of its limitations and what can be done with it,” she said during a panel discussion at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.Artisanal mining, while a significant source of livelihood, often involves harsh working conditions and significant environmental impact. Mercury use in gold extraction poses severe health risks to miners and nearby communities. Deforestation and land degradation further compound the environmental toll. Illicit gold flows are also linked to corruption and conflict financing.“The gold sector has historically been demonised and we need do need think about the livelihood issues,” Hunter said during the OECD discussion. “That being said, we know that gold certainly contributes to conflict financing in multiple African countries, including the CAR [Central African Republic], DRC [Democraatic Republic of Congo], Sudan, amongst others. We know what violent extremist groups in the Sahel profit from the gold sector.”Experts concur that there is a lot more to be done to formalise the gold sector and make sure that African states get revenue from the trade of this gold. While gold is evidently a resource curse, Anthony of PWYP highlighted the tremendous potential of the ASM gold sector considering how much ASM miners were able to produce off the books with little state support or investment.“We walk a thin line between denouncing the problems that are there in this sector but we also don’t want to stigmatism the miners in the ASM sector because we are fully aware that they need this source of livelihood,” Schulz told SWI. “The miners have little impact on how the trade is done.”Efforts between African governments, international bodies, and private sectors are needed for ASM gold mining to be a boon, according to experts. Implementing stricter regulations, improving data collection steps, and fostering sustainable mining practices are all seen as key for an equitable and transparent global gold industry.The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation helped fund the Swissaid report. The latter argues that as a major player in the global gold trade, Switzerland has a special responsibility to ensure its imports are ethically sourced.“State authorities so far have not done much to produce more transparency and they should really do it,” he said. “By creating stricter regulation and more transparency in the gold sector, we can really improve the lives of those miners and their families and populations in African countries.”Edited by Virginie ManginCorrected on May 30, 2024 to fix a mismatched gold amount and currency conversion.","May 30, 2024 - 01:00"

293,Urban flooding slowly becomes a priority issue for Switzerland,"For many older people in Melchnau, a 1500-inhabitant village in canton Bern, the year 1986 will never be forgotten. They all went through what could be called “a collective trauma” to overcome the flood damage.Christian Eicher, a retired civil engineer who spent much of his career working on flood control and urban drainage, told SWI swissinfo.ch that according to historic news records, on June 20 that year, the local area received an extremely heavy thunderstorm. “The streets of Melchnau flooded, as more than 50mm of rain fell per hour. Houses and meadows flooded and roads were ripped open. The major urban throughfare was swamped by up to one metre of water.”“In 1986, the local government had little experience in preparing an urban flood-management plan and had no idea how much its implementation would cost. Despite this, an early Risk Map was commissioned which also included extreme-runoff flow estimates – but there was no concrete follow-up to reduce the flood flows or to protect against,” Eicher explained.Only about twenty years later, in 2007 and again in 2010, heavy thunderstorms with extraordinary rainfall volumes, some combined with previous rainfall and consequently saturated soils, led to widespread flood damage and traffic disruptions. Eicher followed up on the two floods, documented them by taking photos and reported to the municipal authority with some preliminary suggestions for a possible course of actions to show how frequent and devastating the floods have been over the past three decades.Melchnau is not an isolated case in Switzerland. Over the last 40 years, four out of five Swiss municipalities have experienced flooding, about two-thirds (62%) of buildings are exposed to surface runoff, and one in seven people in Switzerland live in a building exposed to flooding, according to the Mobiliar Lab for Natural Risks at the University of Bern

, defined as independent, high-frequency, small- to medium-sized events that are more difficult to monitor than hurricanes and earthquakes. But this doesn’t mean that they don’t cause substantial damage.The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) has been systematically recording and analysing flood damage since 1972. According to a report published in 2021

A flood in August 2005 caused the most damage recorded in the WSL damage database – around CHF3 billion ($3.3 billion).Climate change has pushed urban flooding to the forefront of local governments’ agendas and led to innovative solutions being implemented worldwide.

in the scientific journal Nature Communication says that 1.8 billion people, or 23% of the world’s population, are living in areas directly exposed to a 1-in-100-year flood risk. According to reports from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, floods caused global damage

.Australia has long been known for its flood-control measures and an innovative water-management approach since the 1980s known as Water Sensitive Urban Design. This strategy reduces stormwater flows and increases soil moisture through decentralised infrastructures such as green roofs, permeable pavements, constructed wetlands, and rainwater tanks. Similar concepts elsewhere include the United Kingdom’s Sustainable Urban Drainage System, the United States’s Low Impact Development, and Singapore’s Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme.In Denmark, Copenhagen is taking a novel approach to preventing repeated flooding. The ongoing Skybrudsplan

, or Cloudburst Management Plan, costs €1.8 billion (CHF1.76 billion) and aims to transform the city into a “sponge”: the idea is to redesign public spaces and infrastructure so they can absorb and retain vast amounts of rainwater, much like a sponge would, during periods of intense rain, and release it back into the water cycle.In China, 70 rapidly growing cities
External link
have also adopted the “sponge city” concept to manage water flow and reduce the risk of flooding.Compared to these countries, Switzerland’s implementation of flood-management strategies has lagged behind. It was only in 2018 that the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), together with the insurance industry, began developing and publishing the first Swiss-wide surface-runoff hazard map.According to the Swiss authorities, Switzerland’s annual financial investment in flood protection infrastructure remained between CHF50 million and CHF230 million between 1970 and 2008. Since 2008, the costs have significantly increased, fluctuating between CHF250 million and CHF400 million. However, this is nowhere near enough to offset the damage caused by a rare one-off flood. A 2020 publication by the Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protection (FOCP) shows that a very rare flood could cause damage in excess of CHF10 billion.Switzerland is a few years behind, but climate change is bringing its own set of challenges to Swiss urban planners and urban stormwater managers. “In Switzerland only in recent years it has been realised the significant impacts that pluvial flooding can have to infrastructure and socio-economic activities,” says João Leitão, the head of the Urban Floods and Hydroinformatics group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag). Despite that in general the damages caused per pluvial flood event are smaller than those caused by fluvial flooding, in the long-term the cumulative impacts of pluvial floods can be comparable to those of fluvial floods due to their higher frequency.The “growing pains” of Swiss cities and settlements also exacerbate the risk of urban flooding. Construction must keep pace with population growth and urbanisation. According to the World Bank
External link
, Switzerland’s urban population nearly doubled between 1960 and 2022. Currently, almost three-quarters of the Swiss population
External link
live in urban areas, and around 80% of the country’s economic activity is concentrated there.Based on what he has observed in Melchnau, Eicher says that the increase in impervious surfaces reduces infiltration. “With concrete and asphalt covering areas that were once given over to grass and soil, the water from heavy rains has nowhere to go, resulting in flooding,” he says. “Intensified agriculture, increased mechanization and heavier machinery are compacting soils and reducing the important `sponge` effect of the so-called pervious surfaces. The result is more, earlier and faster runoff from surfaces that are supposed to retain most of the rainfall.”The growing concentration of population and infrastructure in urban areas exposes the country to even greater financial losses from floods. According to Robin Poëll, a spokesperson for the Federal Office for the Environment, around 20% of the Swiss population currently lives in areas that are at risk of flooding due to their proximity to rivers and lakes. About 30 % of jobs and a quarter of Switzerland’s material assets (CHF840 billion) are located in these areas.Given the probability of occurrence and damage potential, “flooding has become one of the dominant risks in Switzerland, and flood protection is a high priority on the Swiss agenda,” says Poëll.While the Swiss government is increasing investments in flood-protection infrastructure, Swiss researchers are recognising that traditional approaches to urban flood management alone may no longer be sufficient to ensure flood resilience. They’re now exploring novel strategies to combat urban flooding.The Mobiliar Lab for Natural Risks launched a research initiative in 2018 entitled Flood-Risk Research Initiative – From Theory to Practice, which aims to develop a flood-dynamics tool and a flood-damage potential tool capable of warning not only of upcoming floods, but also of their effects. These include the impacts of rising and receding floodwater on populations, workplaces, buildings, and roads.“For the first time, the potential damage from flooding can be visually identified throughout Switzerland – down to the neighbourhood level,” says Andreas Zischg, a professor at the University of Bern who participated in the project. “We can see when, where and how many people might need to be evacuated, and when and where roads might become impassable,” he says. “This information can be used by local civilian command teams, insurance companies, logistics companies and others to aid in risk communication, training and operational-level planning.”In 2019, Leitão and his team developed a radical market-ready device called CENTAUR (Cost-Effective Neural Technique to Alleviate Urban Flood Risk) that can be easily installed in existing drainage systems to reduce local flood risks in urban areas.It is designed to optimise the use of existing available in-pipe capacity by combining sophisticated computational techniques with flow-control devices to attenuate and store water during periods of high flood risks.To date no Swiss city has adopted it, although it has been installed in Coimbra, Portugal’s fourth-largest city, and a few municipalities in the UK. Leitão says that the complex distribution of responsibilities for urban pluvial flood-risk management in Switzerland and the co-existence of different drainage system types in newer and older parts of cities, may explain the difficulty to explore novel pluvial flood management solutions.As in other countries with federal political systems, such as Germany or Austria, Swiss flood-risk management is characterised by a complex distribution of responsibilities across different levels and sectors of government. In addition, the introduction of an innovative approach to water management and hydraulic engineering touches on areas such as urban planning, energy, nature conservation, and many others.But things are moving: a few cities in Switzerland have already begun to introduce the sponge city concepts in new projects to mitigate flooding. Leitão cites the VSA (Swiss Water Association) sponge city project that promotes the use of blue and green infrastructure in Switzerland to reduce flooding and stormwater discharges as well as improving ecosystem services, such as reduce heat, increase biodiversity, etc.When he stops by the river in Melchnau, Eicher can now see changes. In 2021, the municipality decided to invest more than CHF4 million in a comprehensive flood-protection project, including the construction of four retention facilities and the widening of the stream channel to reduce the risk of creeks overflowing their banks. “Better late than never,” he says.Edited by Virginie Mangin/gw","May 10, 2024 - 09:00"
294,Reindeer herders battle power line needed for Norway’s climate goal,"By Gwladys FoucheJERGUL, Norway (Reuters) – It is minus 6 degrees Celsius in Arctic Norway and some 30 Indigenous Sami herders have gathered 1,500 reindeer in a corral, sorting who owns which animal after the herds mixed while grazing up on the Finnmark plateau.It is also an opportunity to discuss their big worry: a planned 54 km (34 mile) power line to supply Western Europe’s largest liquefied natural gas plant.The line will be built on pastures the herders use in summer, in coastal areas where they say towns, cabins, roads, existing power lines and other infrastructure have already encroached on the land they use.“We cannot afford to lose more summer pastures,” said Nils Mathis Sara, whose herd graze between May and October in the area where the line is due to be built this summer.“We have nothing else to give away,” he said as he drove to the corral in Jergul, near the winter pasture on the plateau, some 1,700 km (1,000 miles) from the capital Oslo.As the temperature rises from the current 6 C (21 degrees Fahrenheit), they make the preparations to move to the summer pasture, 250 km (150 miles) away near the city of Hammerfest.(For the photo essay, click on )The power line will help Norway cut its CO2 emissions, with the government committing to cut the country’s emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030.With electrification, Hammerfest LNG would use renewable power from the grid – most of Norway’s electricity production comes from hydropower – instead of gas to run its five turbines.The Equinor plant is the second-largest single source of emissions in the country, generating some 850,000 metric tons of CO2 per year, or 2% of Norway’s annual emissions.It exports enough gas to cover the consumption of an estimated 6.5 million homes, mainly in Europe. The electrification would help prolong the production life of the field and export more gas to markets.The conflict illustrates the difficult choices countries must make to cut greenhouse gas emissions and power future growth, often involving competing use for land.CLEAN ENERGYIn time, Hammerfest LNG is due to use power from onshore wind farms that authorities want to build to increase the power supply to Finnmark as a whole, and Hammerfest LNG in particular, the region’s future biggest power user.They are due to be built on reindeer summer pastures too.“It is idiotic we are going to destroy nature for the climate,” said Johan Isak Eira, a reindeer herder from a district where one such windfarm is expected.The government disagrees.“We need to create new jobs, enable more economic activity. Future jobs will rely on clean energy, not diesel-powered generators,” Deputy Energy Minister Elisabeth Saether said.“For this government, it is not an option to give a categoric ‘no’ to new power and new power lines in reindeer herding areas.”She said the Skaidi-Hammerfest power line would have an impact on herding, but the activity could take place in line with article 27 of a 1966 international treaty protecting Indigenous minorities’ rights to enjoy their own culture.In a landmark ruling in 2021, Norway’s Supreme Court said that right was being violated with the construction of two onshore windfarms in central Norway, leading to protests from Sami groups, green activists and Greta Thunberg. The windfarms remained but the herders were awarded compensation and the promise of land.“This is not such a big hindrance that herders will be unable to practice their culture,” Saether said.CLIMATE CHANGEReindeer herders disagree. Sara’s reindeer district group, which numbers around 100 herders, is planning legal action to stop construction of the line. The herders say the impact of the power lines will disrupt the natural behaviour of the animals.“Reindeer avoid the area where power lines are built. You can make them pass under, but they won’t stay there,” herder Eira said. “The structures make them afraid and they don’t like the sound they make.”Female reindeer calve on summer pastures and the young eat grass to build up enough weight to survive on lichen on winter pastures, when temperatures can drop to minus 40 C (minus 40 F).Herders are under pressure on several fronts, including from climate change. They now have to supplement the animals’ feed as milder weather has resulted in ice layers forming from rain showers that then freeze – meaning the reindeer cannot always dig for the lichen with their hooves.Statnett, the grid operator and the builder of the power line, said it “would deliver a sustainable project that takes care of both people and nature” and said power lines when put into operation only affected the reindeer “to a limited extent”.Equinor, the operator of Hammerfest LNG, says it understands “the uncertainty” faced by herders.“There could be dilemmas when we are developing energy infrastructure close to the reindeer herders,” said Kjetil Myklebust, the head of the project at Equinor.“Still, we are confident that it is possible to develop the region’s grid in good dialogue with the affected parties.”On the land it is responsible for, close to the plant, Equinor will build a power cable in a tunnel under Hammerfest, rather than above ground, so that it does not affect summer pastures there.More broadly, herders say society should reduce consumption or find alternatives to cut emissions, such as carbon capture, which the government rejected as too expensive.“What I don’t get about the energy transition is that to make it happen, we need to destroy nature,” said Sara. “To me that does not make sense.”($1 = 10.6091 Norwegian crowns)","April 4, 2024 - 13:02"
295,G7 trade ministers toughen talk on tackling unfair trade,"By Angelo AmanteROME – Trade ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies said on Wednesday they would use their “trade tools” if needed to counter practices that distort the market, in a statement that hardened language compared with a previous communique.The G7 ministers met in southern Italy after the European Union imposed tariffs this month on imports of electric vehicles made in China to try to protect the 27-nation bloc’s motor industry from Chinese EVs that the EU says are heavily subsidised.“We will continue to tackle non-market policies and practices, as well as harmful non-market excess capacity and other market distortions resulting from them,” said the six-page G7 statement, which made no specific mention of China.“To that end, we remain committed to effectively using our trade tools, and, as appropriate, develop new tools, to identify, challenge, and counter these practices, and to promote stronger international rules and norms, together with partners,” it added.Wednesday’s statement took a tougher line than a final communique published last year after a G7 ministerial meeting in Japan, which focused on discouraging protectionism and market distortion more than on deploying trade tools.Apart from tariffs, tools to curb unfair practices may include tighter rules to scrutinise foreign investments such as those the EU proposed early this year.Britain, the only European G7 member that is not in the EU, signalled on Tuesday it was not ready to follow Brussels in imposing levies on Chinese EVs, saying its auto companies had not complained about any unfair practices from rivals.The ministers, who met in the southern Italian region of Calabria, also said “economic resilience requires de-risking through diversification and reduction of critical dependencies,” in an apparent reference to China’s dominance of critical supply chains.“We acknowledge that non-market policies and practices not only undermine the free and fair rules-based international economic order, but may also exacerbate strategic dependencies and vulnerabilities, and hinder emerging and developing countries’ sustainable development,” the statement said.The G7 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States, and the European Union is also invited to participate.","July 17, 2024 - 16:04"
296,US wants ‘as many channels as possible’ to deliver aid to Gaza,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Simon LewisWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is working to get aid into Gaza through as many channels as possible to help remedy a humanitarian disaster amid Israel’s war with Hamas militants, the State Department said on Monday, describing the situation as “simply intolerable.”State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a daily briefing that Washington was “optimistic” about the potential of a maritime aid corridor to Gaza that it has been working on and U.S. military’s airdrops were also set to continue.“Our goal is clear, to establish a comprehensive aid strategy that includes air, land and sea route to maximize the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and ensure that aid is distributed to everyone in Gaza who needs it,” Miller said.He said the Biden administration was continuing to press Israel to open another border crossing to facilitate aid for the northern part of the enclave, where more than half a million people were on the brink of famine and looting was a major impediment to the distribution of aid.He said the new maritime corridor was still in development and declined to give any details such as where shipments would be offloaded in Gaza or whether the U.S. military would be involved.In addition to trucks carrying aid through two border crossings in the south of Gaza, the U.S. military, along with allied nations, has in recent days dropped aid packages into Gaza from aircraft, amid warnings much of the population is on the verge of famine.“Parents are facing impossible choices about how to feed their children. Many don’t know where the next meal will come from, or if it will come at all…that’s why the United States is focused on increasing and sustaining aid in Gaza through as many channels as possible,” Miller said.He emphasized that the air and sea routes were supplements to land deliveries but declined to project when a third border crossing may be opened. He said Washington made it clear to Israel that the situation at the moment was “unacceptable.”“We will continue to press the government of Israel to facilitate increased deliveries to the north,” Miller said. Washington was “very much not satisfied” with Israel’s efforts.U.S. calls for Israel to do more to address the humanitarian crisis have grown louder since the deaths of Palestinians lining up for aid in Gaza last week, with Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday calling on Israel to do more.Gaza health authorities said 118 people were killed, attributing the deaths to Israeli fire and calling it a massacre. Israel, which says many people were trampled or run over, has pledged to investigate.The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says a quarter of the population – 576,000 people – are one step from famine, nearly five months after Israel’s assault on Gaza began.Israel launched the war in response to attacks on southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people. Palestinian authorities say more than 30,000 people have been confirmed killed in Gaza.The Biden administration continues to push for a temporary pause in fighting in exchange for the release of hostages taken on Oct. 7, to allow for improvement of the humanitarian situation, Miller said.(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk and Simon Lewis; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Cynthia Osterman)","March 4, 2024 - 23:02"
297,US needs to build Marshall Islands’ trust over Cold War nuclear dump -US agency,"By Timothy GardnerWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. energy secretary should build trust with the Republic of the Marshall Islands by developing a plan to communicate clearly over lingering threats from a radioactive waste dump left by U.S. nuclear weapons testing that is now seen at risk of floods from climate change, a U.S. agency said on Wednesday.The U.S. conducted 67 nuclear bomb tests on the Marshall Islands from 1946 to 1958. In the late 1970s it deposited radioactive soil and debris from six of the islands into an unlined crater created by one of the tests. The site, called the Runit Dome, was covered with a concrete cap but is now at risk of leaks from flooding due to rising seas caused by climate change, Marshallese officials have said.The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, said in a report that the energy secretary “should develop and document a strategy for communications on radioactive contamination that is sustained, understandable, transparent, engages the RMI government, and builds on lessons learned.”In the report, the Department of Energy concurred with the recommendation. The DOE “made substantial efforts” since the beginning of the administration of (U.S.) President Joe Biden to improve engagement with RMI on the challenges and will consult with the State Department as it develops and implements a plan to work with officials there on the contamination, a DOE spokesperson said late on Wednesday.A 2011 U.S. law requires the DOE to conduct visual studies of the dome and analyses of the groundwater surrounding it.The GAO report said rising sea levels could push up groundwater levels under the dome, “potentially creating a pathway for leaking radiation.”The DOE and the RMI disagree on the radiological dangers posed by the dome, it said.The Marshall Islands embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The report, requested by Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat, also contains information about radioactive contamination in southern Spain after two U.S. defense aircraft carrying four thermonuclear bombs collided in midair in 1966, dispersing debris over a wide area. It also examines radioactive contamination in Greenland resulting from U.S. Cold War activities.(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; additional reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Leslie Adler and Michael Perry)","February 1, 2024 - 07:02"

300,Switzerland returns to Afghanistan despite Taliban recognition issues,"It was a dramatic turning point, the images of which are still etched in our memories today: thousands of people storming the tarmac of Kabul airport in summer 2021, trampling each other in desperation and clinging to the wings of planes taking off. Within days, the Taliban had wrested back control of Afghanistan after nearly two decades, while the international community beat a hasty retreat.To date, no country in the world has officially recognised the new rulers, which once more hold Afghanistan in an iron grip. Right after the takeover, the world community agreed to isolate the regime internationally. Since then, official recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations have been tied to respect for human rights, especially those of girls and women, and the formation of an inclusive government.Three years on, this consensus is showing signs of erosion. While many Western states still staunchly oppose any relations with the Taliban, a growing number of governments are establishing official or informal contacts with them, according to research published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. These include not just Russia and China but also Western states such as Norway and the United Kingdom.As for Switzerland, it is set to become one of the first European countries to return to Afghanistan, thanks to plans to reopen the former office of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) this autumn, to coordinate humanitarian aid.After the Taliban seized power in August 2021, the SDC closed its offices in Afghanistan and evacuated its staff to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. Now, four members of the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit are to be stationed full-time in Kabul to oversee the implementation of SDC-funded projects in the country. Up to now, the agency has been working mainly with multilateral and international organisations such as the UN and the World Bank, as well as international and local NGOs.  + Why the ICRC remained in Afghanistan
External linkWith this step Switzerland could prove to be a trailblazer in Europe, while countries such as France and Germany have remained firmly opposed to direct involvement on the ground and further curtailed their aid. Germany recently announced the complete withdrawal of its state development organisation, GIZ, by 2025, which up to now has continued its activities in Afghanistan with local staff only.Three years after regaining control, the Taliban’s policies represent a growing dilemma for governments. Despite years of efforts by Western diplomats, the regime has so far shown little willingness to compromise. On the contrary, the government under Emir Hibatullah Akhundzada has pursued its radical course with increasing rigour. In August it issued a new “virtue law” with even stricter rules of dress and conduct, aimed mainly at women and girls. Both are still barred from attending secondary schools and universities.The situation in Afghanistan was not properly assessed from the outset to develop an effective strategy, according to Reinhard Schulze, Islamic studies scholar and former director of the Middle East Institute in Bern.  While the Taliban government has always viewed any criticism as a violation of its sovereignty, he says, the international community has put a spoke in its own wheels with the sanctions and restrictions against it. Although politically necessary in order not to legitimise the regime, the measures are counterproductive from a societal point of view, as they undermine the sustainability of humanitarian aid in the long run.Continuing a policy of isolation could have far-reaching consequences for the Afghan population above all. Cut off from international banking and subject to financial restrictions, the Afghan economy has not yet recovered from its collapse, while hundreds of thousands of young people flood onto the labour market each year.The country is today facing one of the world’s biggest humanitarian crises. According to UN figures, more than one third of the 40 million Afghans could suffer from food insecurity this year. The mortality rate for girls is almost 90% higher than for boys, the organisation Doctors Without Borders reports.In parallel, international aid funding has been slashed. At the beginning of the year the UN set its donation target at just under $3.2 billion (CHF2.7 billion), but only one quarter of this has been raised so far.Although Swiss funding also dropped significantly after the takeover, from just under CHF60 million in 2022 to around CHF24 million this year, Switzerland is still a major humanitarian player in the country.The Taliban have long realised that their government will not receive official recognition from the international community in the long term, according Afghanistan expert Ibrahim Bahiss at the international think tank Crisis Group. The regime’s ideology and interpretation of Islam are too much at odds with fundamental values such as the UN Charter on human rights. But, the specialist adds, the Taliban are also playing for time, as they know full well that many states – especially their immediate neighbours – will have no choice sooner or later than to establish at least informal relations for security and economic reasons.The UN has also been striving to follow a more pragmatic approach to the new government in Kabul. In early July it invited the Taliban for the first time to official talks with special envoys from 20 nations in the Qatari capital Doha, to discuss, among other things, opportunities for economic cooperation, for example in the private sector. It is hoped the meeting will signal the start of a process gradually leading to the reintegration of the isolated country in the international system, in order to help the Afghan people in the long term.Engaging with the Afghan government is not uncontroversial, however. The run-up to the talks was beleaguered by fierce criticism. A group of the main donor countries, including France, Germany and the United States, sent a letter to UN headquarters in New York threatening to boycott the meeting or limit their participation. They demanded that the voices of Afghan civil society be heard as well as the Taliban and that the human rights situation in the country be included on the agenda – conditions that the Taliban categorically reject. A meeting planned for last February fell through because of this.With the opening of the SDC office this autumn, Switzerland may succeed in steering a middle course, expanding its humanitarian aid on the ground while keeping its embassy closed for political reasons. Its staff are authorised to establish contact with the Taliban to a limited extent, to discuss humanitarian aid issues.Martin Hongler, vice president of the Swiss private aid organisation Afghanistanhilfe, which has been working in Afghanistan for decades, backs the SDC’s decision to return to the country. The SDC has already helped implement projects there in the past, he says, for instance supporting a health centre. “It is hard to provide aid and assess the situation if you are not actually on the ground,” he says. Moreover, it is an illusion to think you can help the people without the Taliban authorities being involved or indirectly benefiting. He concludes, “people should not be denied help just because they have the wrong government”.Edited by Marc Leutenegger. Adapted from German by Julia Bassam. Subbed ds","September 19, 2024 - 09:00"
301,"Emilia Pasquier, How Swiss ‘unicorns’ and start-ups are faring in California","“I’ve always worked at the intersection of innovation, science and politics,” says Emilia Pasquier. “And for me, California is a symbol of freedom and new ideas.”Before arriving in San Francisco in September 2022, Pasquier spent four years working as an advisor to Alain Berset, then the Swiss interior minister. Before that, she ran Foraus, a participatory think tank on foreign policy.>> In this short video Emilia Pasquier explains what young Swiss entrepreneurs can learn from Silicon Valley:Swissnex

, the Swiss “scientific consulate” in San Francisco, is 20 years old. It is part of a network that stretches from both coasts of the United States to Japan, via Brazil, India, China and Singapore.“We welcome scientists, academics and start-ups, as well as artists and foreign government delegations, who come here to be inspired by our model,” Pasquier says. And the competition is fierce: Austria and Italy have already set up similar structures.Officially, Swissnex aims to “promote exchange and collaboration in the fields of education, research and innovation.” One look at the “wall of fame” in the San Francisco office gives this mission a very concrete meaning: there are more than 150 logos of well-established companies that arrived here when they were still start-ups. And three of them have become “unicorns” – companies valued at $1 billion (CHF860 million) or more.For a full version of the interview, listen to our podcast the Swiss Connection.“We see these young entrepreneurs with great ideas arrive, and for a fortnight we train them in the Silicon Valley mindset,” Pasquier says. Even if Switzerland regularly ranks as the most innovative country in the world, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Intel, Facebook, Tesla, Netflix, Twitter and Google were all born in the Valley – that narrow strip of land some seven kilometres south of the city, between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.And yet, Pasquier notes, “in terms of research, economy and creativity, Switzerland has a density roughly the same as that of Silicon Valley.” It also has two of the best technical universities in the world.So what do Swiss geniuses lack? Perhaps a certain mindset. “When you come here having pitched for business in French-speaking Switzerland and thinking you’re going to try out German-speaking Switzerland, you quickly realise that’s not enough,” she says. “You have to think much bigger.” Nor will it be enough to tell a potential investor or partner that your product has Swiss Made quality. Innovators have to explain that their idea is going to change the world and show they are 300% committed to it. And no, it’s not a myth: “You have two minutes to convince people,” Pasquier says.Of course, money also makes a difference. According to the financial information platform crunchbase
External link
, California attracted $91.9 billion in venture capital investment in 2022. In comparison, the Swiss Venture Capital Report
External link
gives a figure of $3.9 billion for the same year.In the United States, by no means all of these funds come from traditional banks. And even less come from the state. This is the country where venture capital was born. As Pasquier explains, “a virtuous circle has been established in Silicon Valley. We have a huge number of successful entrepreneurs who have made money and are reinvesting it in new start-ups.”Against this backdrop, the director of Swissnex was not really concerned by the bankruptcy in March 2023 of the Silicon Valley Bank, which specialised in financing start-ups. After the setback caused by the pandemic and an exceptional recovery in 2022, she sees it more as a “bump in the road” than a sign of possible decline. Because even if competition is fierce from other technology centres – in the US and around the world – Silicon Valley has nonetheless been the source of the new boom in artificial intelligence.Like everyone else, the director of Swissnex is banking on artificial intelligence to be one of the “next big things” that will attract talent and capital. But there is another: climate technologies.By way of illustration, she cites the donation of $1.1 billion made by the investor couple John and Ann Doerr to Stanford, the “think tank” of the Valley. This sum – the largest ever received at one time by the prestigious university – will be used to create a new school dedicated to sustainability, due to open in autumn 2024.On the political front, the Biden administration passed an anti-inflation bill in 2022 containing a series of measures to reduce emissions and develop renewable energies and carbon capture technologies. For Pasquier, the signals are clear.“When there is an alignment of private funds, public policies and research, all in a fairly concentrated ecosystem, things can move very quickly,” she says, adding there is “great hope” for the climate and the future of humanity – simply “because the world needs it.”That optimism and determination is typically Californian. Since moving to San Francisco, she has come to appreciate the special atmosphere that is so much a part of the city’s charm.“On the street, someone will spontaneously say to you, ‘I love your shoes.’” In Switzerland, you’d immediately ask yourself, ‘What does he or she want from me?’, but here it’s normal,” says Pasquier, who has quickly adopted the “beach life” culture, as they say in California. “It’s surprising at first, but so nice.”Also surprising – though not nice at all – is the impression, in certain areas of the city centre, of arriving in a post-apocalyptic film. On these streets, where one shop after another is closing, drug addicts haunt the pavements, haggard and staggering, in front of parks where children play behind fences.Over the last ten years or so, fentanyl, a synthetic analgesic 50 times more powerful than heroin, has made its way out of hospitals and doctors’ surgeries and onto the streets. “This terrifying drug can kill you in six months,” Pasquier says.>> Emilia Pasquier talks about counter-culture, the tech industry and poverty:In the Tenderloin district, between the luxury shops of Union Square and the majestic city hall complex, there is an open drug scene at almost every crossroads, just like Platzspitz and Letten in Zurich in the 1990s.Zurich, San Francisco’s twin city, could be the inspiration for the city, which has been overwhelmed by this problem. In mid-October 2023, Zurich Mayor Corine Mauch came with a delegation of people from the police, social services and health departments for a visit lasting several days

on the subject of drugs.If Zurich has managed to control the scourge of drugs, why can’t San Francisco? The current mayor, London Breed, campaigned on a promise to end the war on drugs and create a system based on compassion and healing, a system which, according to Pasquier, could resemble “the Swiss four-pillar model
External link
”.But the realities on the ground are very different. “The United States does not have as developed a social system as most European countries,” Pasquier says. “Here, what the state doesn’t do is taken care of by communities, charities and churches.”“You can find a job very quickly, but you can lose it just as quickly and end up on the street”, she adds. Homelessness is a national problem. But California, with its tolerance and mild skies, attracts more than its fair share. According to the 2020 census, the state is home to a third of the country’s 600,000 homeless. In San Francisco, there are around 8,000 homeless people, 1% of the city’s population.The perception of marginality and drug addiction is also very different. Whereas in Switzerland we tend to see such people as victims, here people are quicker to assume they have chosen to be on the streets. While she refrains from “passing judgement on the issue”, Pasquier notes that for Americans, “the concept of individual responsibility is much stronger”.Edited by Samuel Jaberg.

The organisation is pleased that it presented targets for the first time at the Veloforum in Zurich, which was supported by the Federal Roads Office. However, more needs to be done to achieve the goal of doubling bicycle traffic, it wrote.Pro Velo is therefore calling on the federal government to co-finance more cycling infrastructure. Instead of the current 1% of transport infrastructure subsidies dedicated to cycling-specific infrastructure, they are calling 5%. A training campaign should bring in more experts for bicycle planning.Traffic law and technical standards should be designed to be cycle friendly. Cantons and municipalities should have information and advice centres that they are able to turn to. And an annual cycling conference should bring all stakeholders together, wrote Pro Velo.In 2018, the UN General Assembly declared June 3 as World Bicycle Day. As a simple, inexpensive and clean means of transport, the bicycle has great potential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the UN 2030 Agenda.

303,Who benefits from free trade agreements with Switzerland?,"Switzerland’s willingness to participate in free trade deals can be traced backed to the beginnings of European integration after the Second World War. Frustrated by the lack of progress within the European Economic Community (the predecessor of the European Union), the Alpine nation joined Britain, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Portugal and Sweden to create a multilateral body with the goal to remove trade barriers: the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).  The EFTA Convention was signed in November 1959 in Stockholm and came into force in May 1960. Full free trade in industrial goods among EFTA countries was achieved in 1966, a year before the European Economic Community accomplished its own customs union. A happy union between EFTA and the EU was achieved in 1972, when the two rival blocs signed a free trade deal with each other. Since then, Switzerland has concluded 33 FTAs with 43 countries or blocs. The Alpine nation usually makes deals as part of the EFTA bloc but can also go it alone like it did with Japan and China. “From the perspective of Swiss export promotion, every free trade agreement is primarily about facilitating access to important markets for our companies. This strengthens the competitiveness of our business location and thus Switzerland’s prosperity,” says Christine Moser of Switzerland Global Enterprise, the official Swiss organisation for export and investment promotion. Contrary to popular belief, FTAs do not mean trade with no restrictions. The objective is usually to promote more trade by lowering or removing certain barriers such as import tariffs. This involves a lot of negotiations and can take many years to arrive at a mutually beneficial solution. Moser gives the example of the recently concluded FTA with India, which took 17 years of dealmaking. Swiss companies in the machinery, watch and transport sectors especially stand to benefit. “In those sectors, customs duties and tariffs are especially high which puts pressure on Swiss companies on their pricing policy in India,” she says. “With the free trade agreement, companies will get additional leverage on their pricing policy.”In 2022, Swiss companies saved a total of CHF2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) in customs duty thanks to all the FTAs in place, according to the latest FTA Monitor released last month.  FTAs are also not merely restricted to goods. They have evolved to include services, investment and public procurement. FTA negotiations can therefore involve give and take over a wide range of issues depending on the interests and strengths of the partner countries. Since 2010, Switzerland has also introduced a chapter on trade and sustainable development in every FTA. In 2021, a free trade deal with Indonesia narrowly survived a referendum launched by opponents who blamed palm oil cultivation for the destruction of the rainforest there. Countries that sign an FTA with Switzerland do benefit from tariff exemptions in terms of real-world trade. In 2022, 77.1% of Swiss imports by value from FTA partners were duty free. However, there is a significant amount of difference based on the region. For example, the EU and EFTA enjoyed significant proportion of waivers in 2022 of 84.2% and 93.1% respectively, China and the Gulf Cooperation Council in the middle at 64.1% and 68.5% respectively and others like the South African Customs Union and Indonesia at the lower end with 19.2% and 6.7% respectively.  In most cases, Switzerland is better off than its FTA partner. According to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the share of duty free imports and exports vary according to the tariff structures, the products traded as well as if FTA preference are utilised or not. Sometimes it is simply the case of being too complicated for foreign companies to do the necessary paperwork. “For certain products that are produced in highly fragmented international value chains, it is sometimes difficult for companies to fulfil the preferential origin rules,” says SECO spokesperson Fabian Maienfisch. “Companies must document the manufacturing process and, if necessary, adapt it in order to achieve preferential origin.They may therefore decide not to use FTAs if the costs of these adjustments exceed the potential benefits of FTA tariff savings”.

304,High immigration from Europe reflects strong Swiss employment growth,"Check out our selection of newsletters. Subscribe here.The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the Swiss Trade Union Federation and the Swiss Employers’ Association presented the figures at the launch of the 20th report on the free movement of persons accord between Switzerland and the EU, which came into force in 2002.According to the report, immigration from EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states was only higher in 2008. .Germans made up the largest group of immigrants last year (21% of the total), followed by people from France (16%) and Italy (15%).Boris Zürcher, head of the Labour Directorate at SECO, cited low unemployment and employment growth as the main reasons for this development. He also referred to demographic trends.The Swiss population of working age has only grown slightly in the last 20 years. It has even declined over the past two years. However, the growth in the number of jobs in Switzerland has been well above the EU average over the last two decades, said Zürcher.+ Study: Two decades of EU immigration has benefited Swiss economyThe free movement of persons therefore serves to meet the demand for labour, the authors of the report argue. This applies to highly skilled labour as well as to the hospitality, construction and industrial sectors.A similar correlation between immigration and employment growth can also be seen in Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway. However, it is particularly strong in Switzerland, which makes better use of its domestic workforce, says SECO.According to Zürcher, one crucial point is that more women in Switzerland are in gainful employment today than 20 years ago. The rate at which people participate in the labour force in Switzerland is already high by European standards. The country is therefore particularly reliant on immigration in view of the ageing population.+ Why Switzerland doesn’t want to join the EUThanks to the free movement of persons agreement, Switzerland has been able to grow far beyond its demographic potential, said SECO Director Helene Budliger Artieda.The Federal Statistical Office had already announced in February that net immigration had risen to just under 100,000 people in 2023.Budliger Artieda said that this development had once again led to more discussions about limiting immigration. Referring to the UK, she explained that the end of the free movement of persons after Brexit had not led to a decrease in immigration overall.Roland Müller, director of the Employers’ Association, stressed the high costs for companies caused by labour shortages. “The analysis shows once again that EU/EFTA immigration is an important pillar of prosperity in Switzerland,” he said. In this context, he warned against accepting the so-called sustainability initiative, launched by the Swiss People’s Party.+ One in five checks reveals violations of Swiss labour regulationsPoints systems such as those in Canada or quota systems are no better than the free movement of persons agreement with accompanying measures, said Daniel Lampart, chief economist of the Swiss Trade Union Federation.The Swiss report also analysed the effects of immigration on social security systems. According to the authors, immigrants from the EU/EFTA area contribute more to the state pension systems than they receive in benefits. On the other hand, immigrants receive more unemployment benefits than they pay into unemployment insurance. One of the reasons for this is that, on average, immigrants work in seasonal jobs more frequently than Swiss citizens.Adapted from German by DeepL/dkk/sb","June 24, 2024 - 16:55"
305,Fewer Swiss families will be able to afford skiing in Switzerland,"As of February 2024, a family of four will pay one third more for a week’s skiing holiday in Switzerland than in the previous year. These are the findings of a study conducted by Swiss Bank Cler in cooperation with the Swiss economic consultancy institute BAK Economics.Jürg Stettler heads the Institute for Tourism and Mobility at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and specialises in sustainable development in tourism. He spoke to Swiss public television, SRF, about this troubling trend.Swiss public television, SRF: Can an average Swiss family still afford a ski holiday in Switzerland?Jürg Stettler: It’s already too expensive for many people today. Of course, people are increasingly asking themselves whether they still want to afford it. People used to have no other option, but now they have alternatives.SRF: What alternatives are there?J.S: One alternative is that people don’t ski during their winter holidays, but do other sports instead: snowshoeing, snow hiking, sledging. This allows you to avoid the high cost of sking to a certain extent, but as soon as the transport facilities, such as gondolas, are needed to get up the mountain, higher prices hit families there too.SRF: Why is skiing getting more expensive?J.S: The cost of preparing the ski slopes is getting much more expensive. This is a consequence of climate change. Today, it is assumed that ski slopes below 2,000 metres above sea level will no longer function without artificial snow. Additionally, the transportation to the mountains are modernising. In the past, many places had simple ski lifts. Today, chair lifts and cable cars have become for efficient and move faster, this is an added expense for the region.SRF: Many Swiss ski resorts have introduced dynamic prices, meaning that some days are cheaper than others. Does this exacerbate the problem?J.S: For people on a tight budget, dynamic prices are an advantage if they book early or are flexible in the days they choose to go skiing. The railways have succeeded in transferring some risk to skiers. Previously, people could book a trip to the mountains at short notice, depending on the weather and snow conditions. While that is still possible, booking short notice has become more expensive due to these dynamic prices, especially during the high season. This is unfortunate for families with children who are bound to school holiday schedules.SRF: What about overnight stays?J.S: Prices for overnight stays have also risen. While hotels have had dynamic prices for some time, it’s the same game here: Those who are tied to the school holiday schedules pay more as more people are booking during these times.SRF: Are fewer people actually going on skiing holidays today than compared to 20 years ago?J.S: The number of skiers has not decreased significantly in the last 20 years. However, people are skiing less often. This has to do with the fact that fewer people own their personal ski equipment. Renting ski equipment is an additional cost, increasing the overall cost of a skiing trip. Today, more ski resorts offer a discounted season pass. Those who purchase this pass tend to go skiing more often, because with this pass they can be more spontaneous in when they choose to go. But you have to be able to afford it.SRF: How do you think ski tourism will develop in Switzerland?J.S: If global warming continues, the forecasts show that it will become increasingly difficult for ski resorts to keep snow on the slopes. In the long term, skiing will become a leisure activity that fewer people will be able to afford.Translated from German by DeepL/amva","February 8, 2024 - 11:00"
306,"China’s exports and imports return to growth, signalling demand recovery","By Joe CashBEIJING (Reuters) – China’s exports and imports returned to growth in April after contracting in the previous month, signalling an encouraging improvement in demand at home and overseas as Beijing navigates numerous challenges in an effort to shore up a shaky economy.The data suggests a flurry of policy support measures over the past several months may be helping to stabilise fragile investor and consumer confidence, though analysts say the jury is still out on whether the trade bounce is sustainable.Shipments from China grew 1.5% year-on-year last month by value, customs data showed on Thursday, in line with the increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. They fell 7.5% in March, which marked the first contraction since November.Imports for April increased 8.4%, beating an expected 4.8% rise and reversing a 1.9% fall in March.“Export values returned to growth from contraction last month, but this was mainly due to a lower base for comparison,” said Huang Zichun, China economist at Capital Economics.“After accounting for changes in export prices and for seasonality, we estimate that export volumes remained broadly unchanged from March,” she added.In the first quarter, both imports and exports rose 1.5% year-on-year, buoyed by better-than-expected trade data over the January-February period. But the weak March figures prompted concerns that momentum could be faltering again.And a high statistical base seemed to have weighed heavily on last month’s brighter numbers, given that production had jumped in March 2023 as many workers recovered from a wave of COVID infections.“Exports have been the bright spot in China’s economy so far this year. The weak domestic demand led to deflationary pressure, which boosts China’s export competitiveness,” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.Most China watchers say that Beijing has its work cut out as consumer inflation, producer prices and bank lending for March showed that the world’s No.2 economy has a soft underbelly. Moreover, a protracted property crisis remains a drag on overall confidence, spurring calls for more policy stimulus.Rating agency Fitch cut its outlook on China’s sovereign credit rating to negative last month, citing risks to public finances as growth slows and government debt rises.The Politburo of the Communist Party, the party’s top decision-making body, said last month it would step up support for the economy with prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policies, including through interest rates and bank reserve requirement ratios.Beijing has set an economic growth target for 2024 of around 5%, which many analysts say will be a challenge to achieve without much more stimulus.China stocks rose on Thursday off the back of the trade data, with the blue-chip CSI 300 index up 0.9% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index 1.1% higher after the midday break.CHINA STOCKS UPThe headline import surge might not be all linked to domestic demand as shown by some stocking-up of goods by businesses.“So far this year, the Chinese yuan depreciated the least among all major Asian currencies, which backs the strong import figures,” said Wang Dan, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.“Also, Chinese producers are stocking up on raw materials before prices go up,” she added.Shipments of coal into China were 45.25 million metric tons last month, up 11% year-on-year as power generators boosted their buying ahead of peak season for air conditioning consumption.Iron ore imports also ticked up 1.1% last month, as lower prices in March encouraged some buyers to place orders for the key steelmaking ingredient betting demand and prices will pick up later in the year.And soybean imports in April jumped 18% from a year earlier, as buyers snapped up cheap and plentiful beans from Brazil.OVERCAPACITY PAINSChina’s trade surplus grew to $72.35 billion, compared with a forecast of $77.50 billion in the poll and $58.55 billion in MarchChinese exporters had a tough time for most of last year as soaring interest rates weighed on overseas demand. With the Federal Reserve and other developed nations showing no urgency to cut borrowing costs, manufacturers may face further strains as they battle for market share.Analysts say Chinese exporters are continuing to slash prices to maintain sales abroad amid the weak domestic demand conditions. In tandem, factories are also turning out too much, irrespective of whether buyers are out there.Last month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that concerns are growing over the global economic fallout from China’s excess manufacturing capacity.The overcapacity problem has some analysts questioning the quality and sustainability of China’s exports upturn.“Overcapacity has pushed down export prices and fuelled the recent strength in exports. But with manufacturers’ profit margins already squeezed, their ability to slash prices has diminished and export prices are now bottoming out,” Capital Economics’ Huang said.“The ongoing trade-weighted appreciation of the renminbi will pose further challenges.”","May 9, 2024 - 14:10"
307,Crop Trust seeks more funding to protect global seed diversity,"By Ahmed EljechtimiRABAT (Reuters) – Crop Trust, which works to preserve crop bio-diversity, needs to more than double its $300 million endowment fund to be able to support seed banks across the world, Executive Director Stefan Schmitz said.The non-profit organisation jointly operates the Svalbard Global Seed Vault with Norwegian authorities and offers financial and technical support to smaller seed banks, also known as gene banks, in collecting, preserving and breeding crop varieties.Amid a surge in conflicts and adverse impacts of climate change “there is an absolutely great sense of urgency to make sure that the entire gene pool of crops is conserved,” Schmitz told Reuters.Speaking on the sidelines of an International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) conference, in Rabat, Morocco, he said increased funding would enable Crop Trust to fully fund ICARDA’s gene banks.The centre made the first seed withdrawal from the Svalbard vault in 2015, after the Syrian war disrupted the operation of a gene bank in Aleppo.The surge in conflicts stresses “the urgency to have the global biodiversity preserved in order for mankind to continue to have access to what they need to sustain life on earth,” ICARDA’s director general Aly Abousabaa said.Extreme environmental events, such as this week’s torrential rains in Dubai, “have literally washed some of the experiments we had on the ground,” he said.ICARDA operates in 16 dry countries, of which 50% facing conflict. It draws on old crop varieties to breed seeds that are resilient to harsh climates.In Morocco, the centre’s researchers led the development of strains of drought-resisting wheat varieties that “have done extremely well at 200mml of rain, compared to what you would normally receive at between 350mml and 400mml of rain,” Abousobaa said.“We have not yet fully exploited the capacity of science,” he said, urging steady funding “because science cannot afford the ups and downs”.","April 20, 2024 - 19:19"
308,S&P 500’s $18 Trillion Rally Is ‘Broadening Out’: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) — Stocks hit all-time highs as bets the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates fueled a rush into riskier corners of the market.Wall Street extended a pattern of money rotating into small caps and out of the megacap “safety” since last week’s soft inflation data. Over the past four sessions, the Russell 2000 has beaten the Nasdaq 100 by almost 12 percentage points — a feat not seen since 2011. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 — where the likes of Nvidia Corp. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — outpaced the US equity benchmark. That index is less sensitive to gains from the biggest companies — providing a glimpse of hope the rally will broaden out.“Rotation is the name of the game,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “This is consistent with the increased perception of cutting rates.”Brenner highlighted the fact that around 4 a.m. New York time, Russell 2000 futures spiked — while contracts on the Nasdaq 100 slipped. “This means that overseas money, big money, made a very large rotation trade overnight,” he said.To Solita Marcelli, at UBS Global Wealth Management, if the Federal Reserve can cut rates significantly in the context of a soft landing, there will be better prospects for a re-acceleration in earnings growth for lower quality and cyclical segments of the market. At Interactive Brokers, Jose Torres cited another potential reason for the rally in smaller firms: they tend to be domestically oriented and perceived to benefit “disproportionately” if Donald Trump wins the election.The S&P 500 rose to 5,667 — its 38th record this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.85%. The Russell 2000 gained 3.5%, notching its biggest five-day run since 2020. The Nasdaq 100 was little changed. US 10-year yields fell seven basis points to 4.16%. Gold hit a record high.Traders also waded through earnings. Bank of America Corp. gave a forecast for net interest income that exceeded expectations. Morgan Stanley’s traders joined the party across Wall Street in the second quarter even as the firm’s larger wealth business fell short of expectations. Charles Schwab Corp. warned it will have to shrink itself in order to protect profits.While the broadening out in the US stock rally is seen as a positive sign, the surge in small caps in such a short span is showing signs of overheating. In only five days, the Russell 2000 has jumped almost 12% — hitting the most-overbought level since 2017.“History was made today as the Russell 2000 closed 4.4 standard deviations above its 50-DMA,” according to Bespoke Investment Group. “No other major US index (Dow since 1900, S&P 500 since 1928, and Nasdaq since 1971) has ever closed at that much of an extreme.”Matt Maley at Miller Tabak says the gauge has reached the kind of overbought condition that has been followed by declines over the past two years.  “Thus, this could be signaling that the small-cap sector is due for some sort of short-term breather,” he noted. “At the very least, investors should be careful about chasing these stocks over the near-term.”In such case, he says it will be interesting to see if there’s a reversal of the “rotation” move. Tech stocks are coming off their own overbought condition, so there’s no guarantee they will advance during a pullback in the small-cap names, he said.The bottom line? If both tech stocks and small caps decline at the same time, it could cause “some problems for the overall market,” he noted.The move on the Russell 2000 is bullish, but investors should be ready for a potential potential profit-taking or consolidation in the sessions ahead, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.“The longer-term monthly chart on the Russell shows a better picture of its potential,” he noted. “We believe the Russell 2000 can trade back toward its all-time highs as mean reversion in relative strength highlights further bandwidth for the sector against this year’s leadership (tech/AI/Mag7).”Wantrobski also pointed out that broader market breadth/participation has been improving since the CPI rally last week.“The battle between the broader markets and 2024 leadership is set to continue over the short run in our view, as relative strength disparities between these groups show the potential for more rotation ahead,” Wantrobski said. “This cannot be confirmed as a long-term trend/investment theme at this time. So for now, we continue to treat this as a trading opportunity (mean reversion move).”Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler says it is too early to determine whether a sustainable rotation can be maintained. More time and technical evidence are needed to confirm sustainable broadening participation that can lift the market higher is underway.“The current (and long-awaited) broadening of equity gains is welcome, but elevated valuations will limit further market upside to low single digits overall for the remainder of the year,” said Robert Teeter at Silvercrest Asset Management.To Lori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets, the earnings season will be a “key test” for the rotation trade. She added that valuations and positioning have set the stage for an eventual shift to a new leadership, but there have been several false starts.The relative performance of the Nasdaq versus the Russell 2000 has been on a wild ride since 2020, with each besting the other by more than 40 percentage points over different one-year holding periods since the pandemic crisis, according to Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. Dramatic small-cap outperformance has only occurred after a tech stock crash or when retail investors created a small-cap bubble, he said. “Neither setup is relevant now. We believe the Nasdaq will outperform the Russell by its 2003–2019 average of two points over the next year,” he noted.As for whether the S&P 500 or Russell 2000 will outperform over the rest of the year, his view is that both will now do equally well — but not at the same time due to their low correlation. “For the moment, small caps have the better momentum because money managers cannot afford to stay as underweight as they have been forced to be over the last 18 months,” Colas said. “Once their reweighting is done, the S&P should be able to play catch-up.”The S&P 500 has gone 351 sessions through Tuesday without a 2% decline. If the equity benchmark reaches 352 by Wednesday’s close, it will be the longest stretch since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007. The index went roughly 950 sessions from May 2003 to February 2007 without such a slide.The strength of the equity market has been underpinned by optimism the economy has withstood the worst of Fed tightening. In this regard, Tuesday’s better-than-estimated retail sales report was a “healthy” development, according to Bret Kenwell at eToro. It’s better to see the Fed cutting rates on falling inflation than to see the central bank rushing to bolster a weakened economy, he noted.The Dow Average also had an “outstanding day” on hopes of rate cuts and lower taxes and regulations — which may be on the horizon, according to Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. He also cited hopes the market rally will broaden from a narrow set of technology shares into “an array of companies.”Corporate Highlights:Key events this week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.–With assistance from Lu Wang, Esha Dey, Jessica Menton and Sophie Caronello.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","July 16, 2024 - 23:57"

[GVD/EUR]Meanwhile, Powell said on his second day of congressional testimony he was not ready to conclude that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2% though he had “some confidence of that”.Markets are now awaiting June inflation data out of the U.S. and Germany due on Thursday to gauge the timing of potential interest rate cuts.Focus is also on quarterly earnings in the region. Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note: “We expect both earnings and sales to have increased slightly in Q2, marking the first positive y-o-y growth rate since Q1 2023.”Norwegian aerospace and defence company Kongsberg Gruppen climbed 11% to the top of the benchmark index after reporting strong revenue growth, improved margins and a growing order backlog in the second quarter.On the other hand, UK’s Barratt Developments slipped 1.2% as the homebuilder forecast a fall of up to 7% in its home-building targets for fiscal year 2025, citing high mortgage rates and broader economic concerns.“Higher interest rates have caused the UK housing market to stall over the last couple of years, and although mortgage demand looks to be gradually picking up, the ambitious targets set by the new government could be exactly what is required to get the market moving,” said Mark Crouch, analyst at investment platform eToro.Online takeaway food firm Delivery Hero jumped 9.2% after delivery app Baemin, backed by the German group, said it would raise its commission fee for South Korean restaurants.Travis Perkins gained 7.1% after the British construction materials firm named Pete Redfern as its new CEO, succeeding Nick Roberts who will step down on Sept. 16 after five years at the helm.Enagas rose 6.2% after the Spanish grid operator agreed to sell its 30.2% stake in Tallgrass Energy to U.S. fund Blackstone for $1.1 billion.","July 10, 2024 - 18:38"
310,Barclays investors crave simpler bank as CEO Venkat prepares revamp,"By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence WhiteLONDON (Reuters) -Barclays’ CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan is under pressure to deliver a plan this month to win over restless shareholders clamouring for a streamlined business model and higher, more sustainable returns for a fraction of the risk.The British bank has one of the lowest valuations among peers, with shares down by around 24% in the last year, driven in part by a hefty disposal of stock by a top investor, Qatar Holding, on Dec. 4.It has also underperformed UK and eurozone banking indexes, data shows.Eight shareholders who spoke to Reuters — including four among the top 20 — favour shrinking its investment bank, offloading stakes in sub-scale businesses or exiting non-core assets entirely, and putting billions back into their pockets.Barclays’ CEO, known as Venkat, has been listening. Speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos last month, he acknowledged the outsized contribution Barclays’ investment bank had made to group profits, and pledged to restore balance and clarity on the make-up of the bank.In a bid to bolster its British retail bank, Barclays said on Friday it had agreed to buy supermarket Tesco’s banking operations.But with the global economy in flux, buyers of businesses Barclays aims to sell appear to be running shy.The bank’s struggle to secure backers for its UK payment business, reported by Reuters on Feb 1, risks complicating Venkat’s aims and shareholder hopes of a swift turnaround.Barclays, one of Britain’s oldest banking brands, lacks focus, according to fund managers who say they are underwhelmed by its risk-adjusted returns.“The basic problem is this bank isn’t boring enough for the majority of its investors,” said Sajeer Ahmed, portfolio manager at Aegon Asset Management, which manages Barclays shares.“It is an investment bank with a retail bank attached. Management has tried to spell out the benefits of diversification but this just isn’t supporting the bottom line right now,” he said.Many banks streamlined their riskiest activities after the 2008-9 financial crisis, but Barclays set its sights on growing a top-tier transatlantic investment bank from the embers of Lehman Brothers.The regulation which followed the crisis has made making money from investment banking much tougher, pushing investors to question whether it is time to scale back those ambitions.Barclays declined to comment.The bank, which drafted in Boston Consulting Group to help with its revival plan, is due to present it on Feb. 20.HIGH RISKS, UNEVEN RETURNSThe investment bank has long been central to Barclays’ universal banking business model, which also spans consumer and corporate lending.But six shareholders said the group’s depressed valuation reflected the investment bank’s high costs and unpredictable returns.In nine months through September, Barclays’ Corporate & Investment Bank reported quarterly income ranging between 4 billion and 3.1 billion pounds, with quarterly costs of around 2 billion.Returns on tangible equity (ROTE), a key profitability measure, ranged between 15.2% and 9.2% across these quarters.The division consumes 63% of group capital reserves, and delivers returns below industry peers, UBS analyst Jason Napier said in a Jan. 11 note.By contrast, BNP Paribas commits less than a third of group capital to its investment bank, while UBS has said it will allocate no more than 25% of risk-weighted assets to its investment banking operations.Investment banking as an industry also tends to be accident-prone. In 2022, a U.S. securities sales blunder saw the bank’s litigation and conduct costs that year surge to 1.6 billion pounds from 400 million pounds the year before.“Execution is key,” said Benjamin Toms, analyst at RBC. “This means no mishaps and a conduct and litigation expense that is closer to 100 million pounds rather than a billion.”INVESTORS LOSE FAITHBarclays’ forward price to book ratio, a measure of its market valuation relative to assets, is at 0.34 — compared with 0.34 for Deutsche Bank, 0.56 at BNP Paribas, 0.82 at HSBC and 0.95 at UBS, based on LSEG data on Feb. 8.Investors said this reflects doubts about Barclays’ mix of businesses, and a growing consensus that a leaner, simpler bank could deliver stronger returns.Barclays has sub-scale businesses which could fetch respectable price-tags if they were sold, five of the investors said, pointing out that several of these units were unlikely to be more than number three or four in their respective markets.Disposals from Barclays’ Consumer, Cards & Payments (CCP) unit would be welcomed, four of the shareholders said, with one suggesting the international credit cards business applied a “complexity discount” to the bank’s overall valuation.Reuters earlier reported the bank’s wider study of its global payments activities.Capital unlocked by asset sales could support a more generous dividend or buyback programme or be reinvested in fee-earning businesses like wealth management, three investors said.“In my opinion the only way the shares re-rate is a meaningful reduction in the size of the corporate and investment bank, and re-focus of the business on forecastable franchise based revenue streams,” said Ed Firth, analyst at KBW.Jefferies analysts expect Barclays to propose a sharp rise in capital redistribution, rising to around 7 billion pounds by end-2025, to help boost flagging shares.There are signs short-sellers are retreating ahead of any potential move. Barclays has not featured in the top 10 of EMEA’s most heavily shorted large-cap banks since October, research from data firm Hazeltree showed.Investors who spoke to Reuters expect the bank to upgrade its annual 10% ROTE target to between 11% and 13%. In 2023, U.S. bank JP Morgan achieved 21%.“I think people are struggling to believe that higher returns are deliverable and sustainable,” said Ben Ritchie, head of developed market equities at Abrdn.“But once companies get the credit for consistent delivery, it is a game-changer,” he said.($1 = 0.7920 pounds)(Editing by Jane Merriman)","February 9, 2024 - 18:02"

Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.Those wagers emboldened equity bulls expecting lower borrowing costs will fuel corporate profits. While tech remained in the leadership position, an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 — where the likes of Nvidia Corp. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — hovered near a record. That gauge is less sensitive to gains from the largest companies — providing a glimpse of hope that the rally will broaden out.Treasury two-year yields declined alongside the dollar after Jerome Powell said the Federal Reserve is “not far” from the level of confidence needed to ease monetary policy. He noted that interest-rate reductions “can and will begin” this year. The Fed chief also remarked he could see the case for shortening maturity of central-bank holdings. Across the Atlantic, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde indicated officials may be in a position to ease policy in June. Just like the Fed, the ECB is contemplating when to sound the all-clear on inflation and begin undoing the unprecedented monetary tightening deployed to subdue it.“Risk assets continued to surge after major central bank officials provided the strongest hints yet that monetary policy will be loosened soon,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com.The S&P 500 rose 1% — extending this year’s advance to about 8%. That’s double the pace of its equal-weighted version, validating concerns about gains remaining concentrated in a narrower group of shares. In late hours, Broadcom Inc. reported disappointing revenue from its semiconductor business, even as it said AI is helping fuel demand.Just 24 hours before the all-important US payrolls report, data showed jobless claims held at historically low levels last week — the latest evidence of a resilient labor market.The government’s monthly employment is forecast to show a pullback in hiring and wage growth in February — after both advanced significantly in the previous month. Economists expect US employers to have added 200,000 jobs last month.“Barring any major surprises on the job creation or unemployment fronts, we’re of the mind investors’ primary focus will be on “average hourly earnings’,” said Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “After all, inflation outweighs job creation amid the current balance of risks.”Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, bets the most-important item in Friday’s report will indeed be wages — and if they are climbing too quickly. If they are moving up too fast, companies will pass this this cost to the end user which is inflationary, she noted.“The markets have declined on inflationary data, however it has recovered quickly,” Bolvin added. “It’s a constant buy-the-dip mentality mostly because earnings growth and estimates have been strong.”A survey conducted by 22V Research shows that 50% of investors think the payroll data will be “risk-on,” 34% said mixed/negligible, and only 16% expect a “risk-off” reaction.Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said that the central bank should be able to start cutting rates later this year, though she first wants to see more evidence that inflation is cooling further.Global bond markets are facing significant challenges as governments and companies have to refinance about 40% of maturing debt in the coming three years, potentially at higher costs, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.In a report published Thursday, the Paris-based organization estimated that total government debt issued by its 38 member countries will rise by $2 trillion to a record of $56 trillion this year.“It is clear that pressure is mounting on major central banks to lower interest rates due to the rising debt burden in the US and other developed economies,” Razaqzada also noted. “Concerns arise over the ability of these nations to sustain high interest rates, as increased debt servicing costs coincide with the potential for an economic downturn, necessitating further borrowing at elevated rates.”While Lagarde said officials aren’t “sufficiently confident” at present to commence monetary easing, there’s a definite slowdown in consumer prices. “We will know a little more in April, but we will know a lot more in June,” she noted. The ECB’s latest quarterly outlook offered reassurance, putting inflation at 2.3% this year — from 2.7% in December — and revising the 2025 forecast down to 2%.Data between now and June could certainly move the dial — but the only “real take-away” from the ECB decision and press conference was to reinforce an intended first June cut, according to TD Securities’ strategists.“The ECB appears to be on track towards initiating an easing cycle perhaps in June,” said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial. “Given the continuing weakness in Germany, the ECB will want to move as soon as is prudent — but will also be led by confidence that inflation has been quelled and moving closer to its 2% target.”Corporate Highlights:Key Events This Week:Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","March 19, 2024 - 13:00"
312,"SNB Didn’t Reveal Full Carbon Footprint in Report, Activists Say","(Bloomberg) — The Swiss National Bank’s carbon footprint is far higher than reported because the central bank ignores indirect emissions from companies in its stock portfolio, according to a climate watchdog group.The Climate Alliance estimates that such emissions are about four times as much as officials claimed last month. While the SNB said the firms it holds in its vast balance sheet generated 10.2 million tons of CO2, the group’s own calculations put the carbon footprint at as high as 41.7 million tons.The SNB left out so-called “Scope 3” emissions that attempt to gauge the overall climate footprint of an organization’s supply chain, because “data for the companies in the portfolio is limited and the data quality is still insufficient,” according to the central bank’s sustainability report. “Data are based on estimates by third-party providers or voluntary and only partially verified information from the companies themselves.” The central bank didn’t respond to a request for comment on Monday, which is a public holiday in Zurich.  Read More: SNB Discloses Carbon Footprint, Won’t Change Investment PolicyWhile “both the limited availability of data and its quality are a reality,” Climate Alliance says that “simply ignoring the corresponding emissions is unacceptable,” especially in light of the SNB’s investment approach of passive management of broad market indexes of industrialized and emerging countries.In its sustainability report, the SNB also rebuffed calls to take a more active stance on climate change, saying it won’t alter how it deploys its foreign-currency reserves because it is not allowed to “influence economic, political or social developments through its investment policy.”Last week, the European Court of Human Rights said in a landmark ruling that Switzerland had failed to protect its citizens from the ravages of climate change. The Swiss parliament is set to decide on Monday on a series of initiatives that attempt to force the SNB to take climate change into account in its monetary policy, saying it creates significant financial risks that could endanger price stability.©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","April 15, 2024 - 15:40"
313,Apple offers modest growth outlook after iPhone sales help beat profit expectations,"By Stephen Nellis(Reuters) -Apple’s AI-enhanced iPhone made a strong start, pushing quarterly sales ahead of Wall Street expectations, but a modest revenue forecast raised questions about whether that momentum will hold over the holiday sales season.A decline in China sales during the fourth quarter also concerned some analysts and investors, helping send shares down 1.4% in after-hours trade, despite surprisingly large overall profit and revenue in that period.Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told analysts during a conference call that Apple expects overall revenue to “grow low to mid single digits” during its fiscal first quarter, which ends in December. Analysts had expected revenue growth of 6.65% to $127.53 billion during the quarter, according to LSEG data.Apple did say it expects double-digit growth in its services business in its first quarter, leading some analysts to ask executives during a call if overall hardware revenue might decline.Executives did not address that question, or give any indication of how the iPhone might fare, including in China, where Apple’s new AI features are not available. Apple has not said when they will be available.Prior to management’s call with analysts, Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, attributed Apple’s share drop to fourth-quarter China sales coming in below expectations.“We see the potential for sustained weakness in China,” he said.Apple said overall fourth-quarter sales were $94.93 billion, ahead of Wall Street targets of $94.58 billion, according to LSEG. Earnings of $1.64 per share, excluding a massive one-time tax charge in the European Union, topped analyst expectations of $1.60 per share.Fourth-quarter sales of Apple’s iPhone, the company’s main product, were up 5.5% to $46.22 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $45.47 billion. Other product lines missed expectations.Apple’s fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, meaning it reflects only a few days of sales of its iPhone 16 series that went on sale Sept. 20. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters that iPhone 16 sales grew faster than iPhone 15 sales did a year earlier, with both phones on sale for the same number of days in the fourth quarter. Cook also said Apple customers are downloading a new version of its iPhone operating system with what it calls Apple Intelligence features at twice the rate they had the year before.“We’ve had great feedback from customers and developers already,” Cook said. “We’re off to a good start.”AI STRATEGYThe rollout of Apple’s artificial-intelligence strategy, which it revealed this year, hinges on how well its new phones sell. Rather than introduce AI in a standalone app or service, Apple has sprinkled Apple Intelligence throughout its most recent operating systems as new features, such as the ability to help re-write an email in a more professional tone. Those features will mostly be available on iPhone 16 models, which feature more powerful computing chips, although the pro versions of the iPhone 15 both work with Apple Intelligence.While some of those Apple Intelligence features arrived this week, others have been delayed, which has led some Wall Street analysts to wonder whether consumers will be slower to upgrade their devices this year while flagship software features trickle out.Apple’s rivals Microsoft and Meta both said this week they expect continued increases in spending to support their AI strategies. Apple said payments for property and equipment – a measure of its capital expenditures – were up $2.91 billion from the previous quarter to $9.45 billion.Apple’s lower spending comes in part because it uses third-party data centers for some AI work. Some aspects of Apple Intelligence do rely on Apple’s own data centers, but the company is using its own in-house chips to power those features.“There would be some (financial) benefit to us by using our own silicon, obviously, but that’s not the reason we’re doing it. We’re doing it because we can provide the same standard of privacy and security that we can provide on device,” Cook said.Sales in Apple’s services business, which includes iCloud storage and Apple Music, were $24.97 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $25.28 billion, according to LSEG. Mac and iPad sales were $7.74 billion and $6.95 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $7.82 billion and $7.09 billion, according to LSEG data.Sales in Apple’s home and wearables business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods devices, fell to $9.04 billion, compared with estimates of $9.2 billion, according to LSEG. Earnings per share were 97 cents including the charge related to a one-time multi-billion-euro European tax payment.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Akash Sriram; Editing by Rod Nickel and Peter Henderson)","October 31, 2024 - 23:54"
314,Has food label Nutri-Score passed its expiry date in Switzerland?,"In May, Switzerland’s largest dairy processor, Emmi, and the second-biggest supermarket chain, Migros, announced they were ditching the Nutri-Score label that rates packaged food products for their nutritional value and compares them with similar goods.Their decisions, made for different reasons, have raised concerns at Switzerland’s food safety watchdog but add to the growing disillusion with the five-colour traffic light-style labelling system, which is intended to allow consumers to compare the overall nutritional value of food products from the same group and from different manufacturers.Lucerne-based Emmi, whose dairy products include milk drinks, lattés, cheeses, and yoghurts, started trialing Nutri-Score on its best-selling Caffè Latte product in Switzerland in 2021 with a view to rolling it out across its product lines. But the company has now decided to drop the label completely.The system has no real benefit for its consumers, according to Emmi spokeswoman Simone Burgener.“Other suppliers and competitors of coffee milk-based mixed drinks have not introduced Nutri-Score on their packaging, so comparability is not possible,” she told SWI swissinfo.ch by email. “In addition, the application has not been harmonised across all European countries in which Emmi operates.”Migros, which has close to 1,200 stores across Switzerland, had been using Nutri-Score on all its own-brand food since 2021, and questioned the return on its investment.“Our decision is based solely on our experience over the last three years,” Migros spokeswoman Estelle Hain said. “Since its introduction three years ago, this has shown that the benefits are too small in relation to the high costs and effort involved.”The exit of the two heavyweights is being seen as a setback by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO).“The Nutri-Score helps consumers to compare similar products,” spokeswoman Tiziana Boebner-Lombardo told SWI swissinfo.ch by email. “The more foods there are to compare, the greater the usefulness of the label. If large product ranges disappear, it will be to the detriment of consumers.”Nutri-Score was developed in France and first introduced there in 2017. Food products are rated on a five-level colour-coded scale from a dark green A (most balanced) to a dark red E (most unbalanced). The calorie content and proportion of antinutrients such as sugar, salt, and saturated fatty acids have a negative effect on the rating, while fibre, protein, or the presence of fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and certain oils have a positive effect. A label displaying the ranking is stuck onto the front of packaged food products.The system has been adopted in Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and, most recently, Portugal this April. It was also in the running to be selected as a pan-European food label that the European Commission proposed in 2020 to harmonise mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labeling as part of its “Farm to Fork” biodiversity strategy under the European Green Deal. However, to date no proposal for such a system has been tabled by the commission.Switzerland first adopted Nutri-Score in 2019 and close to a hundred producers and retailers covering 229 brands and more than 9,800 products have committed to introducing it.But the labelling system has come in for criticism, including from the Swiss cheese industry, which claims that traditional, artisanal Swiss cheeses, especially mature cheese, generally receive the lowest ratings. The poor grades are a result of the cheeses’ high fat and salt content, high number of calories and low fibre.“In our opinion, Nutri-Score leads to more confusion among consumers than it is a useful tool for a healthy diet,” said Désirée Stocker, spokeswoman for Switzerland Cheese Marketing. “Nutri-Score only rates products within a product category. In practice, this can lead to a highly processed food being given an A, but a natural product such as a semi-hard cheese only a D.”Skepticism about the system’s value is also prevalent in Italy on similar grounds, with staples like extra-virgin olive oil scoring poorly. Other European nations, including Portugal and Romania, have recently pushed back against Nutri-Score claiming that it does not align with national guidelines on what constitutes healthy food.
The debate has even reached Switzerland’s corridors of power. In March, the House of Representatives approved a motion from the Senate asking the government to define the use of Nutri-Score in more detail in the Food Act.The Act currently only states that the government may stipulate “special labelling” such as on nutrition value that goes beyond mandatory labelling requirements on origin, designation and ingredients. The Senate’s motion says the assessment of nutrition value is too simplistic and does not take sufficient account of the extent of processing, the presence of additives, or sustainability.The Nutri-Score system uses an algorithm adapted from a concept developed by the UK Food Standards Agency to regulate the marketing of food to children. The algorithm calculates a food’s rating using a three-step process based on its nutritional content. The first version was used in the system introduced in France in 2017 and it was subsequently updated in July 2022 for food and in March 2023 for beverages to incorporate the latest scientific research.The Swiss government cannot modify the Nutri-Score algorithm unilaterally. It can only offer recommendations when the algorithm is updated through the steering committee of the transnational governance of Nutri-Score (which includes representatives of public health authorities from Switzerland and the six other participating countries). The new algorithm went into force in Switzerland in January and Swiss companies have two years to update their packaging to reflect the changes made.For Migros, adapting its product labels to reflect the new algorithm was one of the reasons for abandoning Nutri-Score.“The effort involved is very high: integrating or adapting the Nutri-Score involves a great deal of packaging work. The costs for the phase-out are significantly lower than the further changeover and any future adjustments to all products,” said Hain.Despite the criticisms of Nutri-Score, some major food companies still support it, including Swiss multinational Nestlé.“Nestlé was one of the first companies in Europe to introduce the Nutri-Score in 2019,” a Nestle spokesperson told SWI swissinfo.ch. “Since then, we have extended Nutri-Score to our entire product range in Switzerland. We have always been open to an evolution of Nutri-Score that is evidence-based according to the latest science and nutrition knowledge.”The FSVO says the labelling system remains an important tool for consumers to make healthier food choices.

with the University Hospitals of Geneva published in 2020 compared it with four other front-of-packaging labels in terms of how it affected the purchasing decisions of more than 1,000 Swiss consumers. It found that the Nutri-Score label “demonstrated the highest percentage of improvement in food choices and the highest overall performance in helping consumers rank the products according to their nutritional quality.”Nutri-Score is not just influencing consumer choices. A study published this year in the European Review of Agricultural Economics

suggests that companies have adjusted their product range to obtain higher Nutri-Score ratings. Products launched or modified after the introduction of Nutri-Score in France in 2017 earned better ratings, indicating a shift to towards healthier packaged food.Edited by Nerys Avery","July 12, 2024 - 17:00"
