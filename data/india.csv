0,Hamburg Sustainability Conference brings the world together for new sustainability alliances,"HAMBURG (Germany): The first  Hamburg Sustainability Conference  (HSC) brings together politics, science and business as well as civil society and international organizations to develop solutions for the challenges of the times. Around 1600 participants from 102 countries discussed a wide scope of issues in more than 60 sessions: from sustainable  hydrogen supply chains  for  global shipping  to  fair raw material relations  for battery production and an  international financial architecture  that is fair for all. The aim of the conference was to develop concrete initiatives to accelerate the implementation of the  UN Sustainable Development Goals  jointly agreed by all countries of the world. The Hamburg Sustainability Conference was an initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Michael Otto Foundation and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. It will continue to take place in the coming years and thus initiate and support long-term change processes, stated the initiators of the conference.  The conference was opened by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Hamburg's First Mayor Peter Tschentscher as well as the Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Achim Steiner. Among others, the President of Namibia Nangolo Mbumba, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva, the Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley, heads of the state of nearly a dozen countries, Chadian civil rights activist and representative of the indigenous peoples Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim and Kenyan activist Mercy Mutana participated in the conference. The collaboration of representatives from politics, business, science and civil society from all parts of the world enables new alliances for concrete initiatives.  Development Minister Svenja Schulze said âThe principle of  international cooperation  is under enormous pressure worldwide. In many countries, nationalists advocate for isolation and stir up fears about the future. That the global community managed to adopt a pact for the future in September in New York under these circumstances is therefore a victory for  multilateralism . We want to build on this and develop concrete answers to questions about the future through new alliances. The major challenges of our time cannot be solved in a national shell but only through international cooperation. First Mayor of Hamburg Peter Tschentscher said âWith the international Sustainability Conference, Hamburg is making an important contribution to more sustainable global development. Our city itself is pursuing an ambitious SDG strategy. With Germany's largest seaport and around 100 consulates, we have excellent connections to all continents. We look forward to new concepts and new ideas for implementing the United Nations' SDGs.â UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said âComing on the heels of world leaders agreeing to the Pact of the Future on the margins of the UN General Assembly, the Hamburg Sustainability Conference is the first next step towards turning these global commitments into tangible action to steer our world to a more sustainable pathâ.  Michael Otto, Chairman of the Supervisory Board Otto Group said âThe major challenges of our time can only be addressed through close cooperation and a collaborative effort among politics, business, and society. The global consensus on the  Sustainable Development  Goals is, therefore, a significant achievement of multilateralism. However, these goals must be pursued with much greater urgencyâ.  Future issues including how shipping corridors can be created and supplied with green hydrogen so that it is possible to travel in a climate-neutral way. How can batteries, which are so important for climate protection, be produced using raw materials that are themselves sustainably sourced. How can the international financial architecture be reformed so that it can support all countries in sustainable development. How can the enormous potential of the private sector and civil society actors be better utilized to achieve the global goals for sustainable development for all and what guidelines can politicians set so that the sustainability pioneers of today set the standards of tomorrow and many more were discussed."

We can't waste a penny with all the challenges the world is facing from the climate crisis to new technologies to conflicts, she added, stressing that it is not enough to rescue states in economic distress, but we must work together and think about how they can grow. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pointing towards conflict between Israel and Palestine showcased the pain with the Israel over its citizens having been abducted and killed over a year ago. âWe feel Israel's horror, pain, uncertainty and sadness. We stand with youâ, he said while addressing the Hamburg Sustainability Conference, while recalling the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians last October 7.  The subsequent war has caused enormous suffering in the Gaza Strip. That is why the German Federal government stands for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and a political process, even if it seems further away today than ever beforeâ. The people need hope and prospects if they are to give up terror. This will only be possible by avoiding escalation in the area,â Scholz stressed adding that Iran and Hezbollah must stop their attack on Israelâ."

Addressing the issue of pollution, Pawan Kalyan stressed the need for permanent solutions, especially in areas like Visakhapatnam. He pointed out the significance of the state's 974 km coastal corridor, which should be developed while maintaining ecological balance. ""Industries must be established without harming the environment. We need to plan now to ensure a healthy future for the next generations,"" he added. Pawan called for collaborative efforts to control water and air pollution. He urged experts, intellectuals, and NGOs to provide valuable suggestions for the design of eco-friendly industries and policies. He commended NGOs for their efforts in environmental protection and acknowledged the Pollution Control Board's use of their services to drive progress. ""We need clarity on how much pollution should be reduced over the next five years. All stakeholders must work together to ensure environmental protection while pursuing rapid development,"" he concluded. The workshop saw participation from P Krishnaiah, chairman of the pollution control board, Cherukuri Sridhar, director of APIIC, and various other experts and officials."
14,"World falling highly short on finances to achieve SDGs, pvt sector need to come forward","HAMBURG: With the least developed countries in the  Global South  facing the wrath of the climate change without much contributions in fossil fuel emissions and desperately needing money to achieve its  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs), the world powers too feel that enough money is not pouring out to finance the needs of those nations. The conflicts on the various parts of the world are also increasing the words on achievement of the SDGs. President Ajaypal Singh @  Ajay Banga  said the world is far away in finances from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The world needs 400 trillion dollars to achieve the SDGs but the world bank with multilateral development banks (MDBs) has access to nearly 300 trillion dollars and shortfall is big. To fill the gap the  private sector  needs to come up, Banga said on Monday while speaking to Times of India on the sidelines of Hamburg Sustainability Conference at Hamburg. Public money is falling short to achieve the goals and in that scenario only the private sector is the option and we have approached the corporate sector. Recently the world bank met 15 top CEOs from the world who have committed to finance and it is time to wait for their pledges to come forth. Banga said the World Bank is making various efforts so that the poor nations from Global South get the finances to achieve their goals which the world desperately needs. Many more meeting are lined up including the serious talks at the upcoming COP 27 at Baku in Azerbaijan. Banga said along with achieving the goals for SDGs, the sincere efforts on sustainability too are badly needed. The world need to sustain its resources without emitting more emissions. In the meanwhile, Achim Steiner, Administrator United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) speaking to TOI said surely we are lagging in achieving the targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on various parameters but the world is inching towards achieving that. The finances are coming in the way of achieving those goals and the conflicts in certain parts of world too has put a spanner. May be the world could take more time but the ultimately the goals will be achieved. On being asked about the another conference of parties COP29 fast approaching where the focus is expected to remain on  climate finance  as the rich nations had pledged to pay and the poor nations in the Global South are desperately waiting for it, he said it is the issue where certain may know the status of climate finance there and also the nations could elaborate about the status of SDGs German Federal minister Shena Schulze speaking to TOI said that Germany is working overtime towards achieving energy transition. we are hopeful to phase out coal plants in phased manner by 2035 and gas may be by 2043 and as per Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) we have committed to turn towards net zero by 2045. She also said that Germany is doing a lot on renewable energy and we are ahead of others in achieving the goals of producing hydrogen which could replace the fossil fuels. "
15,Environment takes centre stage as global summits loom,". Disappearing plant and animal species. Fertile land turning to desert. Plastic in the oceans, on land, and the air we breathe. These urgent environmental challenges will be in the spotlight over the next few months as the United Nations hosts four major sessions to address key threats to the planet. First up is a ""Conference of the Parties"" -- a COP -- dedicated to biodiversity being held in Cali, Colombia, from October 21 to November 1. These are called every two years to debate how the world can cooperate to better protect the rich variety of plant and animal life in the natural world. The  COP16  isn't expected to break new ground but will take stock of progress since the last summit secured historic assurances for biodiversity. In 2022 in Montreal, nations agreed to place 30 percent of the planet under  environmental protection  by 2030 in a landmark pact aimed at arresting biodiversity loss and restoring ecosystems to health. In Cali, countries will put forward national strategies to meet this global objective, and observers hope Colombia as host will provide a model for others to follow. The world's most important conference on  climate change  is this year being hosted by Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic heavily dependent on oil and gas exports, from November 11 to 22. While the last summit in Dubai in 2023 delivered a historic commitment to transition the world away from fossil fuels, supporting poorer countries with climate change will top this year's agenda. The summit, known as  COP29 , is expected to land a new agreement on "" climate finance "": money from rich nations most responsible for global warming to developing countries vulnerable to climate change. There isn't an agreed figure yet, or even consensus on where the money should come from, who should receive it, and what form it could take. But developing countries are pushing for much more than the $100 billion pledged in 2009. This was only reached for the first time in full in 2022. The result of the US election, just six days before COP29 begins, could throw a last-minute curveball into the final negotiations, which have proved divisive so far. It also remains to be seen how many world leaders travel to Baku, the capital on the Caspian Sea, with some expected to focus their energy on COP30 in Brazil next year. The least high profile of the three COPs, this session in Saudi Arabia addressing the loss of fertile land to desert is nonetheless critical. Climate variation like droughts and human activities like overgrazing can result in desertification, a process mainly in dry areas where land degrades and becomes unproductive. Experts hope the COP16 on desertification, scheduled to take place in Riyadh from December 2 to 13, can act as a turning point in addressing this problem.  ""Discussions will focus on ways to restore 1.5 billion hectares of land by 2030, as well as putting in place agreements to manage the droughts that are already affecting many regions of the globe,"" said Arona Diedhiou from the French National Research Institute for  Sustainable Development . In 2022, some 175 nations agreed to fast-track negotiations toward a world-first treaty on  plastic pollution , and the final session gets underway on November 25 in South Korea. The treaty aims to marshal an international response to the plastic trash choking the environment, from oceans and rivers to mountains and sea ice.  Some nations want the treaty to restrict how much plastic can be made while others -- particularly oil and gas producing countries that provide the raw materials to make plastic -- want a focus on recycling.  Hellen Kahaso Dena, head of Greenpeace's Pan-African Plastics Project, hopes that countries ""will agree on a treaty that prioritises reducing plastic production"".  ""There is no time to waste with approaches that will not solve the problem,"" the activist told AFP."
16,âHindu Kush Himalayas are pulse of our planetâ,"Bhopal: Amazon rainforest in Brazil is considered the lungs of the planet. The  Hindu Kush Himalayas  (HKH) is the pulse of the planet, said Padma Shri Dr Eklabya Sharma during the 9th Mahesh Buch Memorial Lecture on âResilience and  Sustainable Development  in the HKH' here on Saturday. Dr Sharma emphasized the unique climate challenges faced by high-altitude regions, where the projected warming rates are significantly higher than the global average. Sharma noted that while plains might see a 1.5-degree Celsius increase, mountainous areas could experience a 2.5-degree Celsius rise by as early as 2030. He also addressed the broader environmental and humanitarian impacts on both local and transborder scales.  The HKH region spans eight countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. Sharma pointed out that decisions affecting these mountainous regions are often made without adequate consideration of their unique circumstances. ""HKH basins support some of the world's most populated regions, but decisions about mountainous regions are often made of mountains,"" said Sharma, who is a strategic advisor and distinguished fellow of Ashoka trust for research in ecology and the environment.  ""From research good practice to come about but it has to scaled up at the community level,"" he said. In 2020, a five-year research study into HKH by 350 experts was shared with HKH region countries with a regional call to action.  He warned that the effects of  climate change  in these areas will soon impact those living in the plains. ""In a 1.5-degree rise in temperature, HKH will lose one-third of its  glaciers  by 2100. Around 3,000 more lakes have been formed in mountains in the last 30 years due to climate change,"" he stated.  What happens in mountains impacts one fourth of humanity. Additionally, Sharma highlighted the multinational challenges these regions face, noting that transboundary rivers represent only 10% of HKH but account for 30% of flood-related casualties. He emphasized the need for cooperative strategies to address these risks.  The  environmental impact  extends beyond water resources. ""Besides impact food security, biodiversity and local cultures could also be lost due to environmental changes in HKH. 60% of India's endemic species are from the Himalayan region. Once lost they will be lost forever from planet earth. HKH has over 1,000 living languages,"" Sharma explained.  MANIT director KK Shukla, the chair of the lecture, said that saving life from ever increasing disasters in the Himalayas is important. NCHSE director, Dr Pradip Nandi and others were also present on the occasion."

The projects align with Bhutan's Gross National Happiness Index, focusing on economic growth and well-being."
19,WHO chief praises PM Modi on 10th anniversary of Swachh Bharat mission,"NEW DELHI:  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , Director-General of the   (WHO), praised Prime Minister   and the Indian government for their efforts on the 10th anniversary of the  .  He highlighted the substantial progress made towards the  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) through this transformative initiative, which focuses on promoting cleanliness and health across the nation. Introducing himself affectionately as ""Tulsi Bhai,"" Dr Tedros expressed his honor in celebrating the milestone, emphasising how strong political will can drive significant changes towards achieving the SDGs. He lauded the Indian government for prioritising sanitation and hygiene as national imperatives, mobilizing resources, engaging communities, and spearheading a movement to eradicate open defecation. Dr Tedros commended the Swachh Bharat Mission for its focus on equity, local involvement, accountability, and sustainability.  He acknowledged the initiative's impact on improving basic sanitation in rural and underserved areas, empowering local leaders, and using data to track progress. He noted the public health benefits, including the reduction of diseases such as diarrhea and malnutrition, and praised the initiative for contributing to the long-term well-being and socio-economic development of communities across India. Additionally, he highlighted the Ayushman Bharat national health protection scheme, recognising it as a reflection of India's commitment to improving the health and welfare of its population. Dr Tedros thanked India for its leadership and expressed hope that its accomplishments would inspire the world. The Swachh Bharat Mission, launched by Prime Minister Modi in 2014, aimed to make India Open Defecation Free (ODF). On the 155th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, PM Modi paid tribute to the nationâs founding father, sharing that he participated in cleanliness activities with young people.  He encouraged everyone to continue supporting the Swachh Bharat Mission, which has become the largest behavioral change movement globally. By 2019, the initiative had celebrated the construction of over 100 million household toilets and declared more than six lakh villages ODF as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhiâs legacy."
20,Centre urged to back fly ash brick industry,"Visakhapatnam: The  fly ash brick  industry offers a significant yet often underappreciated way to combat  climate change , said Dr N Bhanumathidas and Dr N Kalidas, both scientists in  sustainable development . In a letter to Leena Nandan, secretary of Union ministry of environment, forests, and climate change, they said that promoting this industry could have a much larger environmental impact. ""Fly ash brick production significantly reduces the  carbon footprint  compared to traditional clay brick production. Existing plants are equivalent to planting 867.6 million trees in terms of carbon footprint reduction. With full utilisation, the industry could be equivalent to planting 2.892 billion trees. This reduction is comparable to generating 23,863 GW or 79,545 GW of solar power. Govt should not prioritise revenue from selling fly ash over promoting its use in brick production. We believe that current policies may favour private power companies and hinder growth of the fly ash brick industry.,"" they added."

22,Pakistan requests IMF to provide additional $1.5 billion loan to combat climate change," has requested the International Monetary Fund ( ) to provide an additional $1.5 billion loan to tackle the effects of  climate change  in the country, ARY News reported. Pakistan Prime Minister  Shehbaz Sharif  met IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. During the meeting, Shehbaz Sharif spoke about the need for urgent action to control climate change in Pakistan. The loan will support Pakistan's Climate Resilience and Sustainability Facility, which has the goal to promote  economic stability  and  sustainable development  in the country Sharif praised the IMF's technical assistance and capacity-building programs, which have helped to strengthen the institutions of Pakistan and improve its economic management, according to ARY News report.  Georgieva stressed the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability and promoting inclusive and sustainable growth. During the meeting, the two sides spoke about the urgent need to mobilise adaptation financing for climate change. PM Sharif agreed to have the Finance Minister take up the critical issue with senior management at the IMF during the Annual Meetings in October. Shehbaz Sharif and Kristalina Georgieva agreed to boost cooperation between the government and the IMF to promote economic stability and growth, as reported by ARY News. Notably, the IMF released the first tranche of $ 1 billion to Pakistan, which approved a $7 billion loan for Islamabad under the Extended Fund Facility, according to ARY News reported. Earlier this year, the Shahbaz Sharif government faced a weak start by securing just $436.4 million in foreign assistance and grants in July, nearly 85 per cent less than the amount received in the same month last year, Dawn reported. The $426 million in foreign loans and $10.5 million in grants during the first month of the current fiscal year seem insignificant against the ambitious $19.4 billion target for foreign assistance set for FY25. In July last year, Pakistan received over $2.89 billion, largely due to the signing of the 9-month $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, which enabled Pakistan to secure a significant $2 billion time deposit from Saudi Arabia. Total inflows in July 2023 reached $5.1 billion, including $1.2 billion from the IMF and another $ 1 billion from the UAE. Earlier in August, Pakistan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said that Pakistan received $436.39 million in total foreign inflows, compared to $2.89 billion in the same month last year. The Economic Affairs Division (EAD) highlighted that the majority-- $307 million--came from project financing, a 52 per cent decline from the $640 million received in July last year, Dawn reported. "
23,"Guj CM stresses balancing industrial growth, environment conservation","Ahmedabad: Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Thursday said the state is growing rapidly, and the chemical and petrochemical industry will play a significant role in making India a developed country. However, it must conserve the environment and find solutions for  sustainable development . He said the state govt will extend all possible help to the industry. He was speaking at the Chemical and Petrochemical Conclave 2024 by ASSOCHAM in Ahmedabad. India, he said, is on its journey to becoming a developed and self-reliant country by 2047. The industry has a crucial role to play in achieving this ambitious goal. ""The  chemical industry  should bring in solutions to ensure chemical waste is destroyed through scientific processes. Human life should not be affected under any circumstances,"" he said.  The state govt, he said, is committed to supporting initiatives such as deep-sea effluent discharge system for chemical waste and projects that aim at net zero emissions. ""After the success of Make in India, we are moving towards Made in India. When we aspire to be global leaders in different sectors, we should also focus on sustainable development and how we can take care of our environment in our daily life,"" he said.  ""That time is gone when we used to only think about growing our businesses. Today, I want to urge the chemical industry to find ways to ensure 100 per cent disposal of chemical waste in a scientific manner so that it does not affect the environment. There was a time when some units used to discharge chemical waste into drains, which is illegal,"" he said.  He reminded the chemicals manufacturers how the illegal practice had created problems for several units. ""We cannot just keep on growing our business at the cost of people's lives. If you find the cost of implementing a disposal system for chemical waste to be very high, then I want to assure you that the state govt will help you in every possible manner to have it in place. But first, you need to at least come up with solutions,"" said Patel.  Jagdish Vishwakarma, minister of state for MSME, said Gujarat is one of the safest and most policy-driven states, and it has more industrial policies than any other state in India. He said that the chemical and petrochemical sector's production will increase to $1 trillion by 2040.  ""The industry needs to prepare a detailed roadmap for 2047, focusing on aspects like water usage, treatment and solid waste sites. It must focus on increasing recycling in the coming years,"" he added. Chintan Thaker, chairman of ASSOCHAM Gujarat Council, attributed the state's leading position in the chemical and petrochemical sector to the ecosystem and policy framework. Today, Gujarat accounts for 62% of petrochemicals, 52% of other chemicals and 45% of pharmaceuticals produced in India. "
24,IITs develop eco-friendly geogrids inspired by Taj Mahal architecture,"INDORE: Researchers at IITs in Indore and Hyderabad have developed two new  geogrids  for  eco-friendly  construction and tackling  climate change . Inspired by the Taj Mahalâs architecture and the shell of the Indian star tortoise, these geogrids are designed to reinforce soil and other materials in various civil engineering applications. Named Multiaxial Diamond Anchored Octagonal Geogrid (MDAOG) and Multiaxial Concentric Octagonal Geogrid (MCOG), the geogrids can be used in the construction of flexible pavements, airport runways, railway track beds, tunnel construction, and more, according to a statement from the institutes. âThese innovations are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on innovative, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure. This new technology addresses climate change, resource scarcity, and waste management issues,â said Prof Suhas Joshi, director of   Indore. The geogrids can be manufactured using recycled or waste materials, like post-consumer plastics, thus aiding in waste management and reducing the need for new raw materials. They also help stabilize soil, control erosion, and enhance infrastructure resilience, making them crucial for climate-resilient infrastructure. The research team behind these developments included Dr. Baadiga Ramu of IIT Indore and Prof. Umashankar Balunaini of IIT Hyderabad."
25,India-made Ultraviolette F77 export to Europe begins: Details,"Bengaluru-based startup  Ultraviolette Automotive  launched the F77 Mach 2  electric bike  back in April in the Indian market. And now, the company flagged off the exports of the  India-made  F77 Mach 2 electric motorcycles to  European markets . The event was hosted by  Union Minister  of Heavy Industries HD Kumaraswamy and  's Minister of Industries and Commerce MB Patil at Ultraviolette's manufacturing facility in Bengaluru. Initially, only the top-of-the-line Recon variant with a 10.3 kWh battery pack will be available in Europe and the company said that it has plans to ship the entry-level version too. There are no changes made to the export model except for changes in software in the cluster and the number plate holder. These bikes in Europe will be priced between 9,000 to 11,000 euros.  Union Minister Shri H.D. Kumaraswamy stated, âThe expansion of Ultraviolette into the European market represents a defining moment for Indiaâs automotive industry, demonstrating our nationâs ability to compete on the global stage. This is a prime example of how Indian startups are driving innovation in critical sectors like  electric mobility . This export initiative aligns perfectly with our government's vision of making India a global  EV manufacturing  hub."" Shri M.B. Patil said âBengaluru is at the forefront of Indiaâs electric vehicle revolution, and Ultraviolette is the Tesla of India. Their success is a testament to our vibrant ecosystem for innovation and this export marks a new chapter in our stateâs journey toward  sustainable development  and technological leadership.â The F77 Mach 2 is powered by a 7.1 kWh battery pack paired with a 27kW motor whereas the Recon uses a larger 10.3 kWh battery pack paired with a 30kW motor. The standard variant has a claimed range of 211km and the Recon variant gets a 323km range. The Recon variant gets ten levels of switchable regenerative braking levels and the standard variant gets only three levels. In terms of features, the Mach 2 get three ride modes, a five-inch TFT digital cluster, auto-dimming lights, hill hold, ABS, and dynamic stability control. The top-of-the-line Recon variant additionally gets four levels of traction control. The bike also flashes the lights when itâs stationary as a safety feature when the motor is on."
26,Re-revision of NMC's CBME guidelines urged by experts,"The revised  Competency-Based Medical Education  (CBME) Curriculum Guidelines for 2024 published by the  National Medical Commission  ( NMC ) released recently again ruffled feathers with experts dubbing it as âregressive and biased against transgender and disabled individualsâ. The New guidelines released on September 12, 2024, have removed the term âunnaturalâ while listing sexual offences but the stakeholders are objecting to it for being not according to the minimum standards of the  World Federation for Medical Education  (WFME) and are even defying  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act , 2016 and The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019.  Dr Aruna Vanikar, president, Undergraduate Medical Education Board (UGMEB) says, âModified guidelines for the academic year 2025-26 onwards regarding admission of students with âspecified disabilitiesâ under the Rights of Persons With Disabilities Act 2016 concerning admission in MBBS will be notified separately.â The  CBME guidelines  mentioned that âThe disability guidelines stipulated under CBME Guidelines 2023 dated August 1, 2023, shall be applicable for the academic year 2024-25.â The omission of current and scientifically accurate content concerning LGBTQIA+ persons in the CBME Guidelines 2024 has reversed the positive changes made following the 2022 Madras High Court order that directed NMC to remove erroneous terminology, scientific inaccuracies and obsolete medico-legal information. Moreover, the guidelines have ignored the 2018 order of the Supreme Court (SC) on decriminalisation of same-sex relationships. L Ramakrishnan, vice-president, public health NGO SAATHII, Chennai told Education Times, âDevelopers of the medical curriculum and writers of medical textbooks must be updated with the progress in science. In 1990, the World Health Organisation (WHO) removed homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). However, medical textbooks and curricula in India continued to mention it as a psychosocial disorder. The 2019 curriculum contained the same problematic references and after certain amendments in 2022, the (NMC) adjusted the curriculum for two subjects â Psychiatry and Forensics Medicine. It seems like the commission has forgotten about it and has gone back to the older curriculum.â Learning about LGBTQIA+ individualsâ health necessities is important for all future medical practitioners and for that to happen, changes should be reflected in all areas of medical education. Merely pretending that all patients belong to heterosexual or cisgender groups and ignoring the rights of LGBTQIA+ category individuals will not solve the purpose of National Health Policy 2017, Ramakrishnan adds. Dr Vignesh Dhananjayan, transgender, non-binary individual, working as an intern at Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan Medical College & Hospital, Perambalur, Tamil Nadu says. âThe queer community were expecting inclusivity of LGBTQIA+ rights in the CBME Guidelines 2024 but were disappointed to see that it was completely omitted. After withdrawal, we again became hopeful that NMC will take more time to analyse, consult and meet stakeholders to eliminate the mistakes as people from the queer community were portrayed in a stigmatising and discriminatory way in the withdrawn competencies."" Dr Satendra Singh, founder, Doctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change and Director-Professor of Physiology at UCMS & GTB Hospital, Delhi, says, âThe disability act very clearly under sections 39 and Sec 40 says that inclusion of disability rights in the curriculum is mandatory for doctors, nursing and paramedical courses. It is strange to know that something which is sort of one of the best practices has been ditched. India in September 2023, at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) highlighted the inclusion of disability competency as one of the 17 lighthouse initiatives done by the country in achieving  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDG) 10. That is the kind of impact our government is trying to make. On the contrary, NMC has removed disability rights from the national medical education curriculum. Meanwhile, NMC has dedicated 8 hours to sports and there is no explicit mention of disability competencies in the MBBS foundational curriculum, which were allocated mandatory 7 hours in the CBME Guideline 2019.â Dr Singh wrote a letter to the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) expressing his dissatisfaction with the new guidelines. He informed Education Times that after receiving no response from NMC and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, he has now issued a letter to the Minister of Social Justice. Medical science evolves and accordingly, medical curriculum needs to be updated from time to time. âThe doctors and developers of the curriculum at NMC need to be aware of all changes and of the current state of research and scientific understandings, which needs to be reflected in all relevant areas of medical practices and education. The newly released guidelines, if not updated, will continue to negatively affect the people from the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as the medical students from the LGBTQIA+ community who will be subjected to inaccurate and stigmatised information,â says Ramakrishnan. To rule out unscientific and unethical medical practices, âThere is a need to highlight accurate information related to LGBTQIA+ persons in medical education, as this can eliminate unscientific and unethical practices to âcureâ something that is not even a disease. This is also against the Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA) 2017 in India. It becomes an ethical obligation of medical educators to stay up to date with the science and change the curriculum as per the new knowledge and reflect it in textbooks and teaching,â adds Ramakrishnan. Including LGBTQIA+ rights in the undergraduate curriculum is the best way to sensitise medical practitioners. âThe old curriculum guidelines and competencies were already a great injustice done to the queer community. To undo it we need wider sensitisations of senior faculties, resident doctors and medical postgraduates. I think the only chance to correct the past mistakes was to change the UG curriculum, which NMC has missed. Which makes us believe that NMC is no longer interested in making the medical curriculum inclusive, â says Dr Vignesh. The way forward is simple, NMC should reintroduce the earlier MCI-adopted disability competencies in the 2024 guidelines before the new batch joins, to honour Indian laws and WFME standards, else, will be forced to take legal actions, adds Dr Singh."
27,Success of humanity doesn't lie in battlefield: PM at UN,"Amid an air of despondency over the failure of UN and the multilateral system in meeting global challenges, notably the ongoing conflicts, PM Modi on Monday once again stressed the need for ""reforms in global institutions"", saying these are essential for worldwide peace and development. While he did not mention Gaza or Ukraine in his speech, Modi said the ""success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield"". Addressing UN's 'Summit of the Future' in New York, the PM said ""reform is the key to relevance"", adding, ""Permanent membership of the G20 for African Union at the summit in Delhi was an important step in this direction."" As he highlighted India's record in pulling people out of poverty, and its readiness to share the experience with Global South, Modi said a human-centric approach must be accorded highest priority in any deliberation on global future.   While prioritising  sustainable development , PM Modi said the global community must ensure  human welfare  and food and health security. Modi also raised the issue of terrorism in his address, saying while on the one hand the menace posed a serious threat to global peace and security, on the other, areas like cyber, maritime and space are emerging as new theatres of conflict. ""On all these issues, I will stress that global action must match global ambition,"" said the PM.  Modi emphasised the need for balanced regulation at the global level for the safe and responsible use of technology, saying the world needs global digital governance which ensures that national sovereignty and integrity are upheld. The PM said that  digital public infrastructure  should be a bridge, not a barrier for global good. ""India is ready to share its digital public infrastructure with the entire world. For India, one earth, one family and one future is a commitment. This is reflected in our initiatives like one earth, one health and one son, one world, one grid. India will continue to work in thought words and deeds to protect the rights of all humanity and for global prosperity,"" he said. The Summit adopted a 'Pact for the Future' that, according to the UN, will lay the foundations for a sustainable, just, and peaceful global order - for all peoples and nations. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the summit was meant to bring multilateralism back from the brink. Modi began his address by talking about what he described as the largest election held in human history in June, saying the people of India had given him the opportunity to serve them for the third consecutive term. ""Today, I bring the voice of one-sixth of humanity to you. By lifting 250 million people out of poverty, we have demonstrated that sustainable development can be successful. We are ready to share the experience of this success with the entire Global South,"" Modi said."
28,Pant university research student develops biofiber herbicide capsules to 'restore barren lands',"RUDRAPUR: A research student from  GB Pant University  of Agriculture and Technology in Pantnagar, US Nagar, has developed sustained-release  herbicide capsules  made from natural biofiber to ""help rejuvenate  barren land  and reduce labour and costs for farmers"". Jyoti Maheshwari, a research scholar in the chemistry department at CBSH College of Pant University, developed these herbicide capsules using coco peat and readily available biofiber under the guidance of professor MGH Zaidi and Samina Mehtab. The capsules aim to restore land fertility, which is increasingly threatened by rapid industrialisation. Speaking about her invention, Maheshwari said, âThe fibres I have used in these capsules can absorb up to 400 times their weight in moisture. By combining these fibres with herbicides using bio-hydrogel technology, barren land can regain the moisture and essential nutrients needed for farming.â Maheshwariâs research addresses maintaining land fertility amidst ongoing industrial expansion. Traditionally, farmers would undertake a two-phase process to restore barren land. However, these new herbicide capsules streamline the process, saving time, labour, and money. âThese capsules will dissolve in the field and, through the bio-hydrogel technology, release both moisture and the necessary fertiliser. This will help restore fertility to the land in a much shorter time,â added Maheshwari. Her research has drawn attention from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), which awarded her a fellowship under the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) 'Kiran' project. The fellowship, aimed at promoting research excellence among women aged 27-40, recognises Maheshwariâs innovative approach to a critical agricultural issue. Pant University is also in the process of filing a patent for this technology. Most herbicides available in the market today are synthetic, with a primary focus on restoring fertility to barren land. Maheshwariâs idea takes this a step further by combining herbicide with a moisture-retaining biofiber to enhance land productivity. âUntil now, the herbicides or solutions available in the market were synthetic,â she said. âI wanted to find a way to naturally generate moisture in barren land while providing the necessary nutrients. Thatâs how I came up with the idea of using natural fibres that retain moisture.â ""The invention holds significant promise for farmers, especially those struggling with infertile land, and could play a key role in  sustainable agriculture ,"" said professor Zaidi."
29,"Success of humanity lies in collective strength, not in battlefield: PM Modi at UNGA","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister  , addressing the  â landmark Summit of the Future on Monday, highlighted the importance of  collective strength  over conflict in shaping the future of humanity. Speaking to global leaders at the summit, PM Modi stressed that a ""human-centric approach"" must be the highest priority as the international community contemplates the path forward. âSuccess of humanity lies in our collective strength, not on the battlefield,â PM Modi said, notably refraining from mentioning any specific global conflicts, highlighting the need for peace and cooperation. PM Modi also pointed to  sustainable development  as a critical focus, saying that ensuring human welfare, along with food and health security, is essential. He highlighted Indiaâs success in  poverty alleviation , noting that the country has lifted 250 million people out of poverty, a testament to the potential of sustainable development. âBy lifting 250 million people out of poverty in India, we have demonstrated that sustainable development can be successful,â PM Modi said, offering to share Indiaâs experience with the entire  Global South . He called on the global community to prioritize similar efforts, highlighting the need for inclusive growth. In his address, PM Modi also reiterated the urgent need for reforms in global institutions to foster peace and development worldwide, suggesting that outdated structures must evolve to meet contemporary challenges. Prime Minister Modi addressed the serious threat of terrorism to global peace and security during his speech. He highlighted the emergence of new conflict areas, such as cyber, maritime, and space, and called for global action to match the level of ambition required to tackle these challenges.  PM Modi said, ""While on the one hand, terrorism continues to be a serious threat to global peace and security, on the other hand, cyber, maritime and space are emerging as new theatres of conflict. On all these issues, I will stress that global action must match global ambition."" The Prime Minister also discussed the role of technology in the modern era, highlighting the need for balanced regulation to ensure its safe and responsible use. He expressed India's willingness to share its Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for the global good, emphasizing that DPI should serve as a bridge rather than a barrier.  ""For safe and responsible use of technology, balance regulation is needed. We want such global digital governance in which sovereignty and integrity remain intact,"" PM added. At the UN Summit of the Future, world leaders adopted the Pact for the Future, which encompasses a wide range of critical issues, including peace and security, sustainable development, climate change, digital cooperation, human rights, gender equality, youth and future generations, and the transformation of global governance. The Pact also includes a Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations, demonstrating the international community's commitment to addressing the challenges of the present and ensuring a better future for all. Ahead of the summit, as part of his three-day visit to the United States, PM Modi met with leading industry figures to discuss Indiaâs potential as a global partner in business and innovation.

30,"Over 1.1 billion people living in acute poverty, India has most, Pakistan follows: UN","Over 1.1 billion people are living in  acute poverty  with India having the highest number of poor people followed by  , according to  's  Global Multidimensional Poverty Index  2024 released on Thursday. ""The five countries with the largest number of people living in poverty are India (234 million), which is medium HDI, and Pakistan (93 million), Ethiopia (86 million), Nigeria (74 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (66 million), all low HDI. Together, these five countries account for nearly half (48.1 percent) of the 1.1 billion poor people,"" the report said. The report said that approximately 584 million people under 18 are living in extreme poverty, making up 27.9% of all children globally, compared to 13.5% of adults. The findings also indicated that 83.2% of the world's poorest individuals reside in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Meanwhile, low- income countries which comprise 10.2% of the population covered are home to 34.8% of all poor people (400 million). Further, 65.2% of poor (749 million) live in middle- income countries. The report noted that 2023 witnessed more conflicts than at any time since World War II causing displacement of over 117 million people. ""In 2023 there were more ongoing conflicts than at any time since the Second World War.2 The number of people forced to flee from their homes due to violent conflict, disasters or other factors reached an all-time high of 117 million,"" it said. It studied the number of poor people in conflicted region. Nearly 40% of the 1.1 billion people live in povertyâapproximately 455 millionâare situated in countries experiencing conflict. This includes 218 million individuals residing in active war zones, 335 million in fragile or conflict-affected areas, and 375 million living in contexts characterized by very low or low peace. ""The conflict in Gaza has resulted in an estimated 83 percent of the total population being internally displaced, a condition further aggravated by the destruction of over 60 percent of Gazaâs housing stock, as of the end of 2023,"" the report noted. Since 2010, the UNDP and OPHI have released their Multidimensional Poverty Index annually, collecting data from 112 countries with a total population of 6.3 billion. The index utilizes indicators such as inadequate housing, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, nutrition, and school attendance."
31,"Follow protocol with public representatives, CS tells officials","Lucknow: In a meeting with divisional commissioners and district magistrates on Friday,  chief secretary  Manoj Kumar Singh issued strict directions to the officials to give ""full respect"" to  public representatives . Asking them to follow  protocol  with respect to public representatives, the CS said that their contact numbers should be saved in the officials' mobile phones so that they receive the calls of MPs, MLAs and MLCs, speak to them when they call and are able to return their calls if busy in a meeting. The CS added that at meetings organised at the division and district levels, where public representatives are invited, a respectful seating arrangement should be ensured for them as per protocol. He said that complaints and issues raised by public representatives should be resolved on priority and they should be informed accordingly. Discussing the implementation of the  Zero Poverty-Uttar Pradesh  campaign, the CS said that the data of approximately 1.81 lakh enumerators from 57,000 village panchayats had been uploaded to the portal by block development officers. The process of selecting the poorest families and uploading their information by enumerators will begin on Oct 25. Singh said that a campaign to identify and free encroached pastureland should be launched soon. Reviewing the progress on issuing ration cards to workers registered on the e-Shram portal, the CS said that the final date to lock verified data is Oct 25, 2024, and all districts must provide coverage reports by Nov 11, 2024. The CS told officials that the PCS-2024 examination is scheduled for Dec 7 and 8. ""Foolproof arrangements should be made to conduct the exam without cheating and with transparency. A booklet of instructions should be prepared by the commission and sent to the districts to ensure there is no possibility of any disorder,"" he said."
32,World Bank says 26 poorest countries in worst financial shape since 2006,"WASHINGTON: The world's 26  poorest countries , home to 40% of the most poverty-stricken people, are more in debt than at any time since 2006 and increasingly vulnerable to  natural disasters  and other shocks, a new   report showed on Sunday.  The report finds that these economies are poorer today on average than they were on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic, even as the rest of the world has largely recovered from Covid and resumed its growth trajectory.  Released a week before World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings get underway in Washington, the report confirms a major setback to efforts to eradicate  extreme poverty  and underscores the World Bank's efforts this year to raise $100 billion to replenish its financing fund for the world's poorest countries, the International Development Association (IDA).  The 26 poorest economies studied, which have annual per-capita incomes of less than $1,145, are increasingly reliant on IDA grants and near-zero interest rate loans as market financing has largely dried up, the World Bank said. Their average debt-to-GDP ratio of 72% is at an 18-year high and half of the group are either in  debt distress  or at high risk of it.  Most of the countries in the study are in sub-Saharan Africa, from Ethiopia to Chad and Congo, but the list also includes Afghanistan and Yemen.  Two thirds of the 26 poorest countries are either in armed conflicts or have difficulty maintaining order because of institutional and social fragility, which inhibit foreign investment, and nearly all export commodities, exposing them to frequent boom-and-bust cycles, the report said.  ""At a time when much of the world simply backed away from the poorest countries, IDA has been their lifeline,"" World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said in a statement. ""Over the past five years, it has poured most of its financial resources into the 26 low-income economies, keeping them afloat through the historic setbacks they suffered.""  IDA normally is replenished every three years with contributions from World Bank shareholding countries. It raised a record $93 billion in 2021 and World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming to exceed that with more than $100 billion in pledges by Dec. 6.  Natural disasters have also taken a greater toll on these countries over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2023, natural disasters were associated with average annual losses of 2% of GDP, five times the average among lower-middle-income countries, pointing to the need for much higher investment, the World Bank said.  The report also recommended that these economies, which have large informal sectors operating outside their tax systems, do more to help themselves. This includes improving tax collections by simplifying taxpayer registration and tax administration and improving the efficiency of public spending. "
33,"Youth facing unprecedented wave of violence, UN envoy warns","UNITED NATIONS: Young people are facing an unprecedented wave of violence and sexual abuse driven by war,  climate change , hunger, and displacement, the UN's special representative on violence against children has warned.  ""Children are not responsible for war. They are not responsible for climate crisis. And they are paying a huge (price),"" said  Najat Maalla M'jid , the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children. ""Violence against children has reached unprecedented levels, caused by multifaceted and interconnected crises,"" she said. M'jid, a pediatrician from Morocco, will on Thursday present a damning report to a  UN meeting  showing that brutal violence against children is rife, and that technology is facilitating crimes against young people as never before. ""Ending violence is possible, and it makes economic sense,"" M'jid told AFP, stressing that many people globally are committed to ending the scourge. ""The problem is how we can support them, to put all these (solutions) at scale."" But the situation is dire, her stark report shows. Over 450 million children lived in conflict zones as of the end of 2022, 40 percent of the 120 million displaced people at the end of April were children, and 333 million children live in  extreme poverty . That is compounded by more than 1 billion children who are at high risk of being affected by climate change, which M'jid calls a risk multiplier. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-19 year olds, with 46,000 people between the ages of 10 and 19 taking their lives every year. - 'Parents of the future' - Child marriage  is a widespread scourge, M'jid warns, with as many as 640 million victims of the practice. As many as 370 million women and girls were subject to rape or other sexual violence during their childhood, according to a separate report by Unicef.  ""Children could be victim of child exploitation, online or offline. They could be victims of child labor, of slavery, of many things... also of children in armed conflict,"" M'jid said. She warned that with fighting and lawlessness becoming embedded in several societies globally, such as Sudan and Haiti, ""violence becomes normal.""  ""When your children are experiencing violence since their early childhood, seeing only that... how are you going to deal with all this?"" Violence against children has a ripple effect, damaging their mental health, impairing their education and stymying their productivity later in life, the report argues. ""Even if you look at it from the perspective of the cost, it is 11 percent of the national GDP in some countries,"" M'jid warned. The solution lies in a coordinated approach to public spending, involvement of business and civil society, and engaging children themselves, she said. But squeezed budgets and the rise of conservative policies on sexual health and reproductive rights risk holding back efforts to combat violence against children, M'jid warned. ""The issue of the far-right wing and conservatism in many countries will also set back some forms of action regarding sexual reproductive health (and) gender issues,"" M'jid said. ""We are facing a very difficult moment,"" she added. ""These children will be the parents of the future generation."" "

36,"Crazy, Rich Singapore? Yes â¦ and No","Remember that movie,  ? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why donât you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem â by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into. That scene tells you everything about Singaporeâs wealth. It reinforced a certain image of the city-state.  Singapore  â everythingâs shiny, everyoneâs happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called â5Csâ, it defined Singaporeansâ aspirations â cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this. Plusâ¦ This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick. Butâ¦Singapore is not all shiny, happy. A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the worldâs top 100 restaurants) wonât probably see this, or even know about it â thereâs  poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And itâs a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing. Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesnât. Why? Singapore govtâs approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (âInequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poorâ) is âto reward citizens in alignment with the work that is doneâ. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants âcitizensâ¦to protect themselvesâ¦to do it themselvesâ. If thatâs your take on poverty, obviously thereâll be no official poverty line. Naturally, thereâs no official count of poor people either. With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (âA handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singaporeâ), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, âthere are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute povertyâ¦these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree householdsâ. Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesnât earn enough to cover basic needs. In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldnât think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty. Economists also use a concept called relative poverty â a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order). By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced âstagnating wages and an increased cost of livingâ. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But itâs also true for that island of gleaming high-rises. In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: âThe city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.â The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, itâs not race but class thatâs become the deepest social faultline. Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp  income inequality  in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons thatâs produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance â but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty. None of this invalidates Singaporeâs success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people donât know exists. To say  Singaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony."

Emphasising on the role of  digital technology  in expediting the entire process, officials said that the govt has introduced a dedicated portal and a mobile application to streamline the identification and on-site verification of the poorest families in rural areas. The digital tools will facilitate the rapid delivery of govt schemes from different departments to the identified families. The entire process, from the district to the state level, will be easily monitored through these platforms. The govt has issued guidelines focused on the effective use of digital technology and the smooth operation of portals and mobile apps. While the website, zero-poverty.in, will serve as the central portal, each department or autonomous unit will have their own subdomain (microsite) within the portal. The mop-up mobile app will be used by village-level employees and committee members to identify the poorest families. The app will display the records of identified families on the dashboard of a five-member village committee, enabling them to conduct on-site verification and submit feedback directly through the app. The tool aims to identify all the poorest families within each Gram Panchayat in just 30 days. The Rishta mobile app, operated by the livelihood mission under the rural development department, will monitor all processes related to BC Sakhi (business correspondent) along with detailed reports of banking transactions. The app will also display information on the poorest families identified by the mission's digital platform, as well as direct beneficiary transfer payments and related banking services. After a computer-based rating of the verified families, detailed information will be displayed on the microsite of the respective departments on the zero-poverty portal, ensuring swift implementation of govt schemes aimed at these families. The portal will also host a database of all village-level employees and committee members, enabling the CM helpline to make web-based calls and send alerts, notifications, and updates through the mop-up mobile app. The app will also include a voice messaging feature, allowing individuals from even the most remote areas of the state to share their feedback."

39,CS: Identify max of 25 poorest families at village level,"Lucknow:  Chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh  on Friday held a meeting with all divisional commissioners and district magistrates to discuss the implementation of the  Zero Poverty Uttar Pradesh  campaign.  He directed officials to assist in identifying a maximum of 25  poorest families  at the village panchayat level. ""CM   has pledged to identify the poorest families in the state and bring them out of poverty in a timely manner. The selected families will be provided with food, security, clothing, education, health facilities, and housing. Employment and self-employment opportunities will be provided for their regular income. Those unable to work will be supported through existing pension schemes,"" Singh said. The final list of the selected poorest families will be posted at several locations in the village panchayat secretariat for 15 days.  The CS said the assessment of poverty will be two-tiered. ""The first will include landless persons, those lacking livelihood options, uncertain income, and dependence on daily wage, agricultural labour, persons lacking economic resources, and constant scarcity of food and clothing in the family,"" he said. The second level, he said, will include abandoned or widowed women without govt aid, families where the earning member is disabled, aged 65 or above, a migrant labourer, or where a family member is suffering from a serious illness. It will also include those residing in disaster-affected areas, having a livelihood based on handicrafts, no member skilled in any livelihood, and not being a member of a self-help group. While reviewing the Take Home Ration Unit, Singh said all units should be operational, make timely deliveries, and all vendors paid on time. He stated that chief development officers should be held accountable for this and that they should regularly inspect such units. "

41,Uttar Pradesh targets to achieve âZero Povertyâ status in one year,"LUCKNOW: The decision to make UP the first âZero Poverty' state in the  country  was announced officially, on Gandhi Jayanti on Wednesday.  Govt  launched its roadmap to meet this target, under which it will work in âmission mode' to uplift the poorest families from each gram panchayat and integrate them into the mainstream in the next one year. In a detailed action plan provided by chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh to all DMs, he has specified that all impoverished families in UP will receive essential support, including food, clothing, quality education, healthcare, and housing facilities.  Govt will address the issue of a stable source of income for such families.Singh has said that impoverished families will be identified at three levels. Information about the poorest 10-25 families in each gram panchayat will first be collected. A three-tier, hybrid method will be used for the selection of such families, where employees, officers, and officials of the gram panchayats involved in each stage of selection will be held accountable. ""At the first level, the poorest families will be identified using the Mop-up mobile app, based on four key criteria. As per this, these should be families which are either homeless or live in kutcha houses, landless families reliant solely on agriculture for their livelihood, families dependent on daily wages or agricultural labour who have irregular incomes, and families lacking financial resources,"" the CS said. These families will be identified by village-level employees and cadres. Each employee will maintain detailed registrations on the Zero Poverty Portal, which will allow for precise mapping of the families they identify. At the second level, a village-level committee will be established in each gram panchayat, comprising five members: the gram pradhan, a former gram pradhan, the headmaster of the local school, and the head of the two oldest self-help groups.  If there is no self-help group, then ASHA worker and Anganwadi Sevika will serve as alternate members. At the third level, following identification by the cadre and the recommendations of the village-level committee, families will receive an automated vulnerability rating through a digital system. A Performance Support Unit, established at the CS level, will conduct on-site investigations of any suspicious records. If any discrepancy is found, action will be taken against the responsible cadre and the village-level committee. Following the identification procedure, govt will provide benefits of various schemes to the families. This includes ration cards, housing, school admissions, uniforms, textbooks, and other essential resources, medical facilities, including the Ayushman Bharat Insurance Scheme and schemes linked to the labour department.  Benefits under schemes like the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, MNREGA, Skill Development, State Rural Livelihood Mission, Women and Child Development, Nutrition, Jal Jeevan Mission, Namami Gange, etc., will also be extended to the families. ""Families will be supported by the skill development schemes of the State Skill Development Fund and UP Top Up Fund, as well as the Apprenticeship Training Scheme and other govt department initiatives. Additionally, they will benefit from programmes run by CSR initiatives and other non-governmental organisations,"" said a govt spokesperson. The chief secretary said that Zero Poverty portal will be integrated with the Family ID portal. This will help govt identify the poorest families which are not beneficiaries of the National Food Security Mission or who have not yet received a Family ID. ""To create a tailored plan for sustainable income sources for the selected poorest families, students from reputable educational institutions in the respective districts will be engaged with these families. After discussions with the identified families, considering the local conditions and available livelihood opportunities, a project will be developed to explore specific economic possibilities,"" the spokesperson said. The chief development officer will serve as the nodal officer for implementing the scheme at the district level. A multi-sectoral expert team will be established at the state level by Project Concern International India to assist with the implementation, operational support, and monitoring of the scheme."
42,Elon Musk calls Vinod Khosla 'dumb' in Twitter feud over Argentinaâs economy,"Tesla CEO  Elon Musk and Indian-American billionaire  Vinod Khosla  clashed in a fiery social media spat that quickly went viral. The tech titans locked horns over Argentinaâs economy, specifically President  Javier Milei 's conservative policies.  Musk, a well-known fan of Milei's libertarian ideals, didnât hold back when Khosla criticized the Argentinian leader's  austerity program . Musk fired off a blunt reply, calling Khosla âdumbâ and sparking a heated exchange. It all began when Khosla shared a Financial Times article, accusing Milei of wrecking Argentinaâs economy with Trump-like policies. ""Argentina's unemployment rate soars to 52% under Mileiâs dictatorial austerity program,"" Khosla tweeted, warning that Trump's return to power could lead to similar economic turmoil. His post triggered a flurry of reactions, with Musk at the forefront, disputing Khoslaâs claim with a sharp âdumbâ retort. Khoslaâs alarming statistic turned out to be inaccurate. Xâs community notes quickly fact-checked the claim, showing Argentinaâs unemployment rate at 7.6%, not the outrageous 52% Khosla suggested. The slip-up didnât stop Khosla from doubling down, however, as he fired back at Musk, calling out the âmacho brainsâ of the tech mogul and accusing him of being biased on his own platform, X (formerly Twitter). The feud took another twist when Musk sarcastically chimed in on a user comment mocking Khosla for the massive error. Khosla, refusing to retreat, responded, ""Poverty is gross underemployment. Too nuanced for macho brains to understand,"" accusing Musk of pushing false narratives while enjoying selective immunity from community comments. As the online skirmish unfolded, CNN added fuel to the fire with a report highlighting Argentinaâs skyrocketing  poverty rate  under Milei. The country has seen 3.4 million more people fall into poverty in 2024 alone, with nearly 53% of Argentinians now affectedâa number that has set social media ablaze as Musk and Khosla continue their digital brawl."
43,From poverty to self-reliance:How SHGs are changing lives,"Till 2018, like many other members of the  Vantangiya community , Reshma too lived in dire poverty. Her husband, a daily wager, struggled to find steady work due to which the family was under constant financial instability. Looking after six children and an elderly father-in-law, the future seemed bleak and uncertain to her. Things changed for the better when from a state of obscurity and dependence, Reshma emerged as a respected and independent figure in her community after joining a self-help group in 2018. ""Earlier, people knew me by my husband's name but today, I am known as Reshma Bano,"" she says. Her empowerment and newfound confidence became a beacon of inspiration for other women in her village, encouraging them to seek livelihoods, improve sanitation, and adopt better hygiene. The change in Reshma's financial and social condition is a result of the initiatives of the govt which is bringing marginalized communities, like the Vantangiyas and Musahars, into the mainstream. Although Reshma didn't receive formal business training, her connection with the SHG exposed her to a wealth of information about govt schemes and services. This newfound knowledge, combined with her determination, gave her the courage to take risks and explore new opportunities for her family's livelihood. Inspired by her husband and father-in-law's interest in fish farming, Reshma ventured into this business, which proved to be a turning point in her life. She also began small-scale goat rearing, diversifying her sources of income. Once grappling with poverty, Reshma now contributes Rs 60,000-70,000 to her family income annually. ""Hadn't I joined the SHG, this would not have been possible. Today, I can dream of a better future for my children. My confidence has grown, and I am no longer afraid of taking risks. Every woman from our community should such missions of the govt,"" she says."
44,"Poverty no excuse, says HC as lawyer refers to poem to justify false rape case","Kolkata: A poem by a former railway magistrate came up during the hearing of a rape case, in which the allegations turned out to be false, in  Calcutta High Court  on Wednesday. As the lawyer of the mother and daughter who had made the allegations under âpolitical pressureâ and âdue to extreme povertyâ referred to the poem in which the judge acquitted a poor boy who sold tea in a train without licence, the division bench said  poverty  couldnât be an excuse to lodge false complaints. While noting that the mother-daughter duo had lodged the complaint due to abject poverty, the bench of justices Arijit Banerjee and Apurba Sinha Ray stated, âSuch a case (that of the poem âThe Tea Seller and the Judgeâ written by  Bharat Chugh ) cannot be equated with the present case since no innocent person was booked under criminal laws on the basis of activities of the young tea-seller. He violated the provisions of law due to his poverty. We must reiterate that poverty cannot be a ground for lodging false complaints against innocent persons.â Three Behrampore residents â Rajbul Sk, Makarul Sk and Asadul Sk â have been languishing in jail for a year following the  false rape case . The complaint was registered by police in Aug, 2023, under   since the daughter was allegedly a minor. The mother has revealed that they had lodged a false complaint due to tremendous pressure from local netas. While tendering unconditional apology, the mother stated that her husband was bed-ridden and the family was dependent on state govt schemes. She claimed that the local netas offered enhanced grants under the scheme, and under mounting pressure from them, she decided to lodge a false complaint. The accused in the case alleged that the girl had been married twice and could not be a minor.  The HC held that prima facie it appeared that the duo had fabricated false evidence. âIt is true that minor victims have been protected by Section 22(2) of the Pocso Act, 2012 even if they make false allegations. But, if a victim misleads the authority regarding her age and persuades the authority to take legal action against an innocent person by claiming that she is a minor, we think that the benefit...is not available to such victim who is not a minor at the time of lodging false complaint,â HC said. The HC directed that after the conclusion of trial, the special judge at Behrampore will inquire into the allegations and if it was found that the alleged survivor was an adult at the time of the complaint, action would be taken."
45,"Success of humanity lies in collective strength, not in battlefield: PM Modi at UNGA","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister  , addressing the  â landmark Summit of the Future on Monday, highlighted the importance of  collective strength  over conflict in shaping the future of humanity.

46,Where is the freedom in poverty or fear?,"The Road to Freedom:  Economics  and the Good Society by Joseph Stiglitz, makes the case that economic and political  freedom  are inseparable. It seeks to take back the rhetoric of freedom from conservatives and libertarians. Freedom has been interpreted by Western politicians like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and economists like Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. Financial deregulation was named âliberalisationâ, to connote this freeing. After the fall of communism, this neoliberal consensus swept the world. It says accept claims of market efficiency as a matter of belief, never asking, for instance, why US healthcare is the most expensive in the advanced world, with the worst outcomes. Any failure is ascribed to external factors, not flaws in the system itself. This book argues with those ideas, from a 21st century perspective. Deregulation caused the biggest financial crisis in 75 years, free trade accelerated deindustrialisation, and free corporations exploited consumers, workers and the environment. As philosopher Isaiah Berlin put it, âfreedom for the wolves has often meant death for the sheep.â People struggling with scarcity and fear are not free, the book points out. For Stiglitz, freedom lies in oneâs âopportunity setâ, the range of choices actually available to you. What does the right to vote mean to a starving person?2008 may have been the apex of  neoliberalism , when govts rescued the banks, and the cost to the rest of us exceeded the banksâ gains. This is the signature move of the system: losses are socialised, gains are privatised. If this system has led to galloping inequality, thatâs not coincidental. Its first patrons were billionaires and big corporations. We cannot divorce the current distribution of income and wealth from the current and historical distribution of power. Our social problems are not laws of nature or economics â they are choices, the result of rules and regulations governing the economy. Neoliberalism is not only inefficient and unstable, it generates corrosive inequalities and a narrowing of vision, the book says. Adam Smithâs metaphor of the âinvisible handâ, the idea that pursuing self-interest leads to social well-being, has been debunked by the experience of the last quarter-century. Instead of growth and better lives for all, it has brought monopolisation and concentration of economic power. Questions of distribution and questions of efficiency are not separate: even IMF and OECD emphasise that economies with greater equality perform better. The flaw with the libertarian position is that it does not acknowledge actual tradeoffs. To understand freedom, we must understand that we are not islands, our actions affect each other. And when the promise of faster growth and high living standards, widely shared, does not pan out, the loss of hope has political consequences. Fascist and authoritarian govts are a result of the state not doing enough for its citizens, not of it doing too much. Neoliberalism is cracking under its own strains. What this book proposes is a tempered vision of âprogressive  capitalism â, or a rejuvenated social democracy. It would focus on reducing inequality, reining in corporate power, valuing humans and nature as well as GDP and balance sheets. In some sectors, cooperatives or non-profits might work better than profit-maximising companies. Market and state would act in balance, and there would be a key place for collective action, with the aim of truly expanding human freedom."

52,Orry claims to have lost 23 kilos with this simple change in diet: All about it,"Orhan Awatramani, popularly known as Orry has recently claimed that a strict  zero-sugar diet  helped him lose almost 23 kilos. Orry weighs 50 kgs right now.  In an episode of Arhaan Khan's podcast, Dumb Biryani, Orry revealed his  weight loss  journey, diet, lifestyle and more. Arhaan Khan is the son of Malaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan. He said his morning begins with an egg white omelet. He skips meals throughout the day and has dinner occasionally. He stressed on his zero-sugar diet and said he aims to lose 2-3 kilos more. Sugar plays a key role in keeping the overall weight stable. Reducing  sugar intake  is key to effective weight loss. Sugar is high in calories but offers little nutritional value, and leads to weight gain if consumed in excess. When you eat sugar rich foods, they cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, which can trigger insulin release. Insulin encourages fat storage, particularly in the abdominal area.  Sugar can increase hunger and cravings, leading to overeating and making weight loss harder. See more:  Instead of cutting down sugar all of a sudden, take baby steps. Cutting back on added sugars, like those or processed foods, will cut calories and boost general health. Foods like fruits and vegetables contain the natural sugars, fiber, vitamins, and minerals that facilitate digestion and prevent sudden spikes in blood sugar. Replacing sugary snacks with protein-rich foods, healthy fats, or whole grains may fill you up longer and keep unwanted calories off your body. Read product labels carefully because sugar could be labeled under many other names such as fructose, sucrose, or corn syrup in most processed foods. Diet plays a key role in weight gain. There are certain signs you must pay attention to. Frequent hunger or cravings even after eating, suggests that your diet is unhealthy and is causing you weight gain. Too much refined carbohydrates or sugar intake causes spikes and crashes in blood sugars, which stimulate overeating. Low energy is another manifestation of unhealthy diet usually caused by a diet of more processed foods and less nutrients. Feeling bloated or having digestive problems can also be linked to high intake of salt or incorrect selection of foods. You could gain weight in case your serving sizes were more than what the body requires and only eating such healthy foods."

She conveyed a special message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lauding the foundation's unwavering commitment to eradicating hunger and nourishing humanity. The event, held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, underscored India's dedication to global well-being. Kamboj emphasised India's progress in tackling poverty, with over 415 million people stepping out of poverty, significantly ahead of the 2030 target. ""India is taking bold steps, especially in eradicating poverty. Our actions today are painting the canvas of tomorrow. It's a journey of hope, a journey of change and we've already made history. Over 415 million people in India have stepped out of poverty among the 25 countries that halved their multidimensional poverty within 15 years, much ahead of 2030,"" she said. She reiterated India's mantra of ' Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ' - One earth, one family, one future, illustrating the country's holistic approach to sustainable development. ""But we are not stopping here. Our mantra, 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'-One earth, one family, one future guides us. At the  G20 summit  last year, we showcased millets, our heritage crop to the world,"" she added. The Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (PM POSHAN) Yojana initiative, highlighted by Kamboj, exemplifies India's commitment to achieving  Zero Hunger  (SDG 2). By nurturing over 100 million children across 1 million schools and incorporating millets into their diet, the initiative is a giant leap towards ensuring food security and nutrition for all. ""The Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (PM POSHAN) Yojana initiative is a giant leap towards zero hunger. It's nurturing over 100 million children across 1 million schools, incorporating millets, marking a stride forward in the global fight against hunger,"" said Kamboj. Furthermore, Kamboj commended Akshaya Patra for its innovative approach to solving hunger and achieving educational goals. Recognized by institutions like Harvard Business School, the foundation aims to feed 3 million children by 2025, driving both SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 4 (Quality Education).

54,"35,000 step out for first edition of Gurgaon marathon, UP runner wins title","GURGAON: In a state envied for its sporting heritage and lauded for its international success across disciplines, the tremendous response to the  inaugural Gurgaon Marathon  was hardly surprising. Little wonder the  district administration  was so intent on promoting it.  The event's theme, ' run for zero hunger ', was noble enough. But the appetite and passion for running has grown so strong that upwards of 35,000 registered for the marathon. Not all, as it turned out, could be accommodated, and maybe the organisers stretched themselves in trying to do too much in too short a time window. For instance, some of those who had entered for the marathon informed TOI that despite registering and paying for their kits, they received nothing in return. ""My friends and I were here since 4am, but we did not get our kits because of which we couldn't participate - I feel the arrangements could have been better,"" said a disappointed Himanshu.  Still, for all organisational hiccups, the first  Gurgaon Marathon  on Sunday brought the Millennium City together in a rousing celebration of fitness. People of all ages and from many walks of life - including school and university students, and executives from private and public organisations - could be seen revelling in their hometown's newest experience by testing their levels of stamina. It was motivating enough for those not yet converted, to consider registering next year.  Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, alongside the event's brand ambassador Shikhar Dhawan, flagged off the 10km and 5km runs. The CM then boarded an open jeep and cheered for the participants for a part of the route, which was certified by the Association of International Marathon and Distance Races (AIMS).  Apart from disclosing that the Gurgaon Marathon will become an annual affair - to be held on the last Sunday of February - Khattar announced plans to hold similar events in each district headquarters every month, to aid in spreading the culture of running, and also in growing awareness of the benefits of the activity, throughout the state. Indeed, a related event will be held in Faridabad next Sunday, the CM added.  That many thousands turned up to run, Khattar said, was a reflection of the city's evolving brand identity. Yet, for all the feelgood vibes, plenty remains to be done to bring the marathon up to global standards. Manisha Srivastava, who has twice run the Boston Marathon, believes the city's cosmopolitan vibe, corporate identity and economic heft - as well as the upward mobility of a working population that prioritises healthy living and pursues endurance sports - makes it a magnet for such events. But for that to happen, the government needs to get its act together to improve the quality of life.  ""Before such an event can be conducted, the city infrastructure, especially roads, needs to be upgraded, and the traffic needs to be better organised,"" she said. ""In short, the quality of the event should not be compromised."" Something, then, for the authorities to seriously mull over before they start planning for next year.  Nonetheless, the dedication of the volunteers, cops and many others ensured the debut edition passed off with as little disruption as possible. And alongside the action on the roads were cultural performances through which the organisers sought to convey important social messages, including advocating for a drug-free Haryana. Among those who took to the stage were Haryanvi singer MD Desi Rockstar and radio jockey Naved.  Winners across categories celebrated, of course, but each one of those who registered and took part was key in making the event a success. Indians took much of the acclaim on the day, but the international contingent also enjoyed their moment in the sun, including Ethiopians Chaltu Gonfa (winner in the women's half marathon) and Mikiyas Yemata Lemlemu (second runner-up in the men's full marathon).  Kiran, who is from Rohtak, and Ajay Kumar of UP won the women's and men's full marathon events respectively, for which they took home Rs.1.5 lakh each. In the half marathon, Chaltu Gonfa and Prashant Choudhary (UP) finished first, earning Rs.1 lakh, while in the open 10km, Ruby Kashyap and Abhishek - both from UP - were declared the winners and awarded Rs.50,000 each. Altogether, cash awards worth some Rs.13 lakhs were handed out to the top finishers. "
55,Experts for establishing hunger-free & zero-carbon Bihar,"Patna: In a joint initiative aimed at fostering  sustainable agriculture  and mitigating  climate change  impacts, the   State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) and Tata-Cornell Institute (TCI) on Friday organised a consultative meeting here with a focus on the project titled âTowards a  Zero-Hunger ,  Zero-Carbon  Food System for Bihar.â The Zero-Hunger Zero-Carbon (ZHZC) project, led by TCI, Cornell University, is a two-year endeavour spanning from 2021 to 2023. The project is designed to assess the potential of establishing a food system in Bihar that is both hunger-free and carbon-neutral. TCI utilised expert consultations, extensive field assessments, and district-level data to model scenarios under which Bihar could achieve a zero-hunger and zero-carbon future. The consultative meeting unveiled the final findings of the project, highlighting critical interventions in the crop and livestock sectors with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without compromising farmer yields. At the inaugural session, state agricultural department secretary Sanjay Agarwal spoke on the impact of climate change on agriculture and soil. He outlined measures being taken for both mitigation and adaptation, emphasising the challenges faced by south-eastern Bihar, including erratic rainfall distribution and high temperatures affecting paddy yield. Agarwal discussed the state governmentâs commitment to tackling climate change in the agriculture sector, citing the allocation of Rs 1,62,000 crore for promoting sustainable agriculture under the Agriculture Road Map. He also mentioned chief minister Nitish Kumarâs directives for flagship schemes like Jal Jivan Hariyali and Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA), including a focus on organic farming in the Ganga river belt. BSPCB chairman D K Shukla highlighted the significance of the ZHZC project in the context of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs announcement of providing free rationed food to 21 crore people in India from January 1, 2024. Shukla emphasised the need for sustainable food production without harming the environment and called for funds to address challenges associated with emission reduction in the food system. TCIâs founding director Prabhu Pingali dwelt upon the relationship between climate and agriculture, emphasising the importance of addressing the adverse impacts of climate change through adaptation and mitigation measures. He identified the opportunities for pursuing ZHZC and outlined the projectâs objectives for the next three years. District-level analyses under the ZHZC project revealed varying trends in greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting the need for district-specific strategies to achieve âZero-Hunger, Zero-Carbonâ goals. The findings also identified districts with the greatest potential for a decline in GHG emissions without compromising productivity and household income. The consultative meeting concluded with a commitment to pursuing the identified opportunities over the next three years, working towards a sustainable and resilient food system for Bihar. BSPCBâs member secretary S Chandrashekar proposed a vote of thanks."
56,5 million meals for children through #RunForZeroHunger,"NEW DELHI: For every kilometre covered by the participants of the  Vedanta Delhi Half Marathon , over five million underprivileged children received nourishing meals. The second edition of the race saw more than 35,000 participants racing past the streets of Delhi. They weren't merely running for personal glory; rather, they were united in a shared mission to combat hunger, aligning with Vedanta's #RunForZeroHunger initiative in which the company's flagship social impact program, Nand Ghar, pledged to provide a nutritious meal to children in 14 states for every kilometre run by the racers. Speaking to TOI, Priya Agarwal Hebbar, non-executive director, Vedanta Limited, said, ""The marathon today was a testament to the immense impact of participatory sports for the sake of fun, fitness, and, most importantly, a noble cause. It is the dream of Anil Agarwal, our chairman, to ensure that every child in India goes to sleep on a full stomach."" The 6,000 Nand Ghars, which serve as modernised anganwadis, are working to transform the lives of women and children in Vedanta's commitment to a malnutrition-free India. They act as catalysts at the grassroots-level, focusing on health, nutrition, preschool education, women's empowerment, community involvement of women and child development. Hebbar said over the next five years, Vedanta aimed to extend the care and support of Nand Ghars to 100 million women and children. ""The ultimate dream is to convert the 13,000 anganwadis into Nand Ghars,"" she revealed. In a pre-run to the marathon, the event sponsors saw nearly 30,000 employees raising money for 3.5 million meals, a third of the target. ""While some employees ran in Delhi, others engaged in mini-marathons in their business locations and contributed to the grand event through the StepSetGo app,"" said an organiser."

58,West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee threatens hunger strike after EC sacks DIG,"NEW DELHI/KOLKATA:   on Monday removed Murshidabad deputy inspector-general (DIG) of police Mukesh following two violent incidents there, which EC attributed to 'lack of supervision' by law and order authorities. ""The Commission has decided to remove DIG Murshidabad (in rank of inspector-general) in context of two violent incidents reported there involving use of weapons and explosives and lack of supervision in immediately preventing follow-up incidents,"" EC sources told TOI.  The move led to strong reactions from  West Bengal  chief minister  . She said she is ready to go on  hunger strike  outside EC office. ""If I can fast for farmers for 26 days, I can go on a hunger strike for 55 days outside your office as well. I will see how many jails you have. How many cops you have. And how many people you will thrash. I have been assaulted a lot of times. I know how to fight. I am not a coward! Remember this,"" said Banerjee. The DIG's transfer to a non-election-related posting with immediate effect is in line with EC's declaration during its pre-poll visit to West Bengal that there will be zero tolerance of poll violence and any incident will see fixing of responsibility at the higher levels. EC issued a notification asking West Bengal govt to suggest three eligible officers as probable replacements for Mukesh by 5pm on Monday. The state has proposed three IPS officers - Syed Waquar Raza, currently posted with Kolkata police as Joint CP (crime), Ranendra Nath Banerjee, DIG (IB), and Debasmita Das, DIG (STF) - for EC to choose from. The transfer comes after violence in Murshidabad's Beldanga, after which prohibitory orders had to be clamped and 10 people were arrested. ""Today one of our DIGs has been changed following BJP's instruction. If   take place in Murshidabad and Malda, EC will have to take responsibility. I know who can pacify riots. You did it knowingly after listening to BJP. Ab chun chun ke officer change kar rahe hain (Now they are changing select few officers). If there is even a single instance of riot, we will hold you responsible as you are in-charge of law and order maintenance now,"" Mamata said while campaigning in Dimdima for Alipurduar candidate Prakash Chik Baraik. Since the announcement of Lok Sabha polls, EC has ordered a slew of transfers in West Bengal, including that of DGP Rajeev Kumar and non-cadre district magistrates Bidhan Chandra Roy from Purba Bardhaman, Tanvir Afzal from Purba Medinipur, Purnendu Kumar from Birbhum, and Sunil Agarwala from Jhargram. Additionally, the poll body has relieved two senior officers, additional chief electoral officer   Chowdhury and joint chief electoral officer Rahul Nath, of poll management duties in West Bengal."
59,Over 1 billion food meals wasted in a day while 783 million people affected by hunger: UN Report,"BATHINDA: Households across all continents wasted over 1 billion meals a day in 2022, while 783 million people were affected by  hunger  and a third of humanity faced  food insecurity .  Food waste  continues to hurt the  global economy  and fuel  climate change , nature loss, and pollution. These are the key findings of UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) report published on Wednesday, ahead of the International Day of Zero Waste. The UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2024, co-authored with environmental charity, waste and resources action programme (WRAP), provides the global estimate on food waste at retail and consumer levels. It provides guidance for countries on improving data collection and suggests best practices in moving from measuring to reducing food waste.  In 2022 there were 1.05 billion tonnes of food waste generated (including inedible parts), amounting to 132 kilograms per capita and almost one-fifth of all food available to consumers. Out of the total food wasted in 2022, the 60 per cent happened at the household level, with food services responsible for 28 per cent and retail 12 per cent. âFood waste is a global tragedy. Millions go hungry as food is wasted across the world. Not only is this a major development issue, but the impacts of such unnecessary waste are causing substantial costs to the climate and nature. If countries prioritise this issue, they can significantly reverse food loss and waste, reduce climate impacts and economic losses, and accelerate progress on global goalsâ, said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. Since 2021, thereâs been a strengthening of the data infrastructure with more studies tracking food waste. Globally, the number of data points at the household level almost doubled. Nevertheless, many low- and middle-income countries continue to lack adequate systems for tracking progress to meet Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 of halving food waste by 2030, particularly in retail and food services. Only four G20 countries (Australia, Japan, UK, USA) and the European Union have food waste estimates suitable for tracking progress to 2030. Canada and Saudi Arabia have suitable household estimates, with Brazilâs estimate expected late 2024. In this context, the report serves as a practical guide for countries to consistently measure and report food waste. The data confirms that food waste is not just a ârich countryâ problem, with levels of household food waste differing in observed average levels for high-income, upper-middle, and lower-middle-income countries by just 7 kg per capita. At the same time, hotter countries appear to generate more food waste per capita in households, potentially due to higher consumption of fresh foods with substantial inedible parts and a lack of robust cold chains. According to recent data, food loss and waste generates 8-10 per cent of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions â almost 5 times that of the aviation sector â and significant biodiversity loss by taking up the equivalent of almost a third of the worldâs agricultural land. The toll of both food loss and waste on the global economy is estimated at roughly USD 1 trillion. Urban areas are expected to particularly benefit from efforts to strengthen food waste reduction and circularity. Rural areas generally waste less food, with greater diversion of food scraps to pets, livestock, and home composting as likely explanations. As of 2022, only 21 countries have included food loss and/or waste reduction in their national climate plans (NDCs). The 2025 NDCs revision process provides a key opportunity to raise climate ambition by integrating food loss and waste. The Food Waste Index Report underscores the urgency of addressing food waste at both individual and systemic levels. Robust baselines and regular measurement are needed for countries to show changes over time. Thanks to implementation of policies and partnerships, countries such as Japan and the UK show that change at scale is possible, with reductions of 31 per cent and 18 per cent respectively. âWith the huge cost to the environment, society, and global economies caused by food waste, we need greater coordinated action across continents and supply chains. We support UNEP in calling for more G20 countries to measure food waste and work towards SDG12.3,â said Harriet Lamb, CEO of WRAP. âThis is critical to ensuring food feeds people, not landfills. Public-Private Partnerships are one key tool delivering results today, but they require support: whether philanthropic, business, or governmental, actors must rally behind programmes addressing the enormous impact wasting food has on food security, our climate, and our wallets.â UNEP maintains tracking country-level progress to halve food waste by 2030, with a growing focus on solutions beyond measurement towards reduction. One such solution is systemic action through public-private partnerships (PPPs): Bringing the public sector, private sector and non-government to work together, identify bottlenecks, co-develop solutions, and drive progress. Appropriate financing can enable PPPs to deliver farm-to-fork reductions in food waste, drive down GHGs emissions and water stress, while sharing best practices and encouraging innovation for long-term, holistic change. PPPs on food loss and waste are growing worldwide, including in Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and in the UK where they have helped cut over a quarter of household food waste per capita from 2007-18."
60,Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ends his 21-day hunger strike,"NEW DELHI: Climate activist  Sonam Wangchuk  ended his 21- day  hunger strike  to  demand statehood  for  Ladakh  and its inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, on Tuesday. Earlier Sonam Wangchuk made a fresh appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fulfil promises made to the people. In a post on X, Sonam wrote, ""21st Day OF MY #CLIMATEFAST 350 people slept in - 10 Â°C. 5000 people in the day here. But still not a word from the government. We need statesmen of integrity, farsightedness & wisdom in this country & not just shortsighted characterless politicians. And I very much hope that Narendra Modi ji and Amit Shah ji will soon prove that they are statesmen..."" Sonam Wangchuk, an engineer and education reformer, began his protest on March 6, demanding statehood for Ladakh. His protest on March 6 was held at an altitude of 3,500 metres with sub-zero temperatures.  He has been highlighting the damage from industrialization to the region's fragile ecology and the impact on glaciers. One of his demands is the implementation of the sixth schedule to ensure land protection and autonomy for tribal areas in Ladakh. Gradually, his protest is gathering support and media attention across India. In the last 20 days, Wangchuk said, around 60,000 of Ladakh's 3 lakh residents have participated in the hunger strike demonstrating their pain but ""no word came from this government""."
61,Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy: Most of you have not experienced hunger. I have ...,"Infosys founder  NR   said that he âexperienced hungerâ for 120 hours non-stop when he was  hitchhiking  in Europe 50 years ago. Murthy said the same while addressing a special event 'Achievements in  Food Security : India's Strides Towards Sustainable Development Goals', hosted by the Permanent Mission of India to the UN at the UN headquarters. Commemorating the milestone four billionth meal served by Indian NGO -- The  Akshaya Patra Foundation  --, the event showcased India's innovative strategies, policies and achievements in food security and nutrition and their alignment with SDGs, particularly the target of zero hunger. âMost of you have not experienced hunger. I have,â Murthy said while addressing an audience of UN diplomats, officials, academia, civil society organisations and members of the Indian diaspora during the event. He said that 50 years ago, âI experienced hunger for 120 hours non-stop when I was hitchhiking in Europe and at a place called Nish, a border town between Bulgaria and what was then Yugoslavia and today Serbia,â Murthy said. âMost Indians here and I have received good quality and highly subsidised education from the Indian government. Therefore, as civilised people, we must show gratitude to our nation and help the future generation of these helpless, poor children to get (a) good education,"" he said. Adding that success is bringing a smile to the face of helpless people, Murthy said, ""Akshaya Patra is hugely successful by that count. If our poor children lose hope and faith in our society, they will turn to violence and destroy all the good that India has achieved and is hoping to achieve.â The Infosys founder emphasised that India has been making good economic progress due to the success of the government's economic policies, vision and the hard work of Indian entrepreneurs and citizens as well as the foreign direct investment from multinationals. He noted that the government of India runs the world's largest food security programme, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), which benefits over 800 million people. As part of it, the school feeding programme PM POSHAN (Poshan Shakti Nirman) scheme directly benefits over 118 million children. Murthy said he is ""very impressed"" that Akshaya Patra has used technology in a big way to ensure that food is clean and delivered hot and dust-free. ""Any rational discussion on such an initiative would make people say it is impossible. However, the Akshaya Patra leadership and the team have proved that a plausible impossibility is better than a convincing possibility,"" Murthy said. (With agency inputs)"
62,âBijnor now linked to mainstream devptâ,"Lucknow: Participating in a  Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra  in  Bijnor  on Saturday,  Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath  said that after having been linked with the  mainstream development , Bijnor is progressing towards becoming an exemplary district in western Uttar Pradesh. The CM spoke about his governmentâs  zero tolerance policy  towards crime, saying that it had put an effective end to it in the state while âunder previous governments, riots and curfews were a regular affairâ. The Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra is a central government initiative to reach out to people ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and publicise its ongoing schemes and to increase the number of beneficiaries under them. âPrevious governments used to ignore the poor, leading to hunger, illness and a lack of housing. They only listened to a few selected people. Young people also struggled to find jobs. When it came to organising the Kanwar Yatra, legal cases had to be filed. Today, the Kanwar Yatra is taking place, and a grand temple of Lord Ram is being built in Ayodhya,â the CM said.  Highlighting the development in Bijnor, the CM said that both government and private medical colleges were being established in the district. Under the central government schemes, he added, free housing facilities have been provided to 4 crore poor people in just 9.5 years. Along with this, facilities such as free toilets, gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme, ration, free tests during the Covid-19 pandemic, free treatment and free vaccines were provided, he said, adding that industrialisation and income generation received a boost through initiatives like âOne District One Productâ(ODOP). The Centre is giving life insurance benefits to businessmen and annual health insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh to every poor person, the CM said. The insurance scheme, he claimed, was being availed by 50 crore people in the country, and 10 crore people in just UP."
63,Brazil election: A clash of titans as Bolsonaro faces Lula,"RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazil's presidential election on Sunday is being contested by 11 candidates but only two stand a chance of reaching a run-off: former President  Luiz Inacio  Lula  da Silva  and incumbent Jair  Bolsonaro . Both are political titans, and eight of 10 Brazilians will vote for one of them, according to pollster Datafolha. That leaves little space for challengers and means that in lieu of fresh proposals and detailed programmes, the two frontrunners have mostly harped on their experience and railed against each other.  ""Both candidates are very well known, the vote is very crystallized,"" said Nara Pavao, who teaches political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco, adding that most voters made up their minds long ago.   Sunday's election could signal the return of the world's fourth-largest democracy to a leftist government after four years of far-right politics led by a president criticised for challenging democratic institutions, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that killed nearly 700,000 people and an economic recovery that has yet to be felt by the poor.   Polls show da  Silva  with a commanding lead that could possibly even give him a first-round victory without any need for a runoff.   But even if that doesn't happen, the vote itself marks an improbable political comeback for da Silva, a 76-year-old former metal-worker who rose from poverty to the presidency - then just four years ago was jailed as part of a massive corruption investigation that targeted his Workers' Party and upended Brazilian politics.   Da Silva's conviction for corruption and money laundering sidelined him from the 2018 race that polls showed him leading, and allowed Bolsonaro - then a fringe, far-right lawmaker - to cruise to victory.   A year later, however, the Supreme Court annulled da Silva's convictions amid accusations the judge and prosecutors manipulated the case against him, which has allowed him to run again now.   In many ways, Sunday's vote is the race that should have been in 2018. And many voters are acutely aware of that.   Among them is Antonio dos Santos, who voted for Bolsonaro in 2018 but will cast his ballot for da Silva this time.   ""What I'm most upset about is when the pandemic started, (Bolsonaro) seemed to be taking it as a joke,"" said dos Santos, a 55 year-old hairdresser who lives in the working-class Rio neighbourhood of Rocinha.   ""Children dying, women losing their husbands. He's not the man I thought he was.""   ""What matters to me is to see Brazil doing well, everyone working, everyone eating,"" he said.   Throughout his campaign, da Silva has sought to remind working class voters like dos Santos that his 2003-2010 presidency was marked by social advancement propelled by a massive social welfare programme that helped lift tens of millions into the middle class.   That isn't what Bolsonaro, who frequently refers to da Silva as a ""thief"" and an ""ex-jailbird"", wants voters to remember.   A former army captain, he campaigned in 2018 on an anti-corruption platform while defending a show-no-mercy approach to crimefighting, traditional family values and national pride. His 2018 slogan - ""Brazil above all, God above everyone"" - is back this year.   But this time around Bolsonaro's campaign has met fresh headwinds, in part due to his COVID-19 policies that a Senate investigation said warranted criminal charges to hold him responsible for Brazil's 685,000 pandemic deaths.   Women in particular have turned their backs on him. Many were dismayed by his apparent lack of empathy during the pandemic as he spurned vaccines and largely ignored their plight as the primary caretakers of children and the elderly while Brazil was ravaged by the virus.   ""Bolsonaro was already rejected by women in 2018, but it got worse,"" said Carolina Botelho, a researcher with the Institute of Social and Political Studies at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.   In that demographic, da Silva still enjoys a 20-point lead over Bolsonaro, who has sought to improve his standing among women and others by highlighting his administration's generous pandemic welfare programme.   But tough times remain. As elsewhere in the world, Russia's invasion of Ukraine stoked inflation and food insecurity in Latin America's largest nation.   Bolsonaro has softened the blow by lowering taxes on fuel and supporting Congress' push to extend and increase welfare payments for millions of struggling Brazilians.   Da Silva has denounced the latter measure as a temporary fix, given it ends in December. He promises to fight hunger and poverty the way he did during his presidency, through his globally acclaimed  Zero Hunger  strategy.   His pick for running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, a center-right former rival, was a nod to financial markets - more recently bolstered by an endorsement from a former central bank governor who highlighted sound macroeconomic policy in a previous da Silva administration.   Bolsonaro's four years in office have also been marred by the Amazon rainforest's worst deforestation in 15 years.   But no single Bolsonaro claim has driven moderates to rally around da Silva like the current president's insistence that Brazil's electronic voting system is prone to fraud.   His claim, for which he has presented no evidence, has raised concerns that he could reject election results and attempt to cling to power.   Earlier this month, Bolsonaro said in an interview that if he doesn't win Sunday's first round, ""something abnormal has happened within the electoral court"".   Bolsonaro has even accused top members of the electoral authority, who are also Supreme Court justices, of working against him. Such comments fuel a sense among Bolsonaro's avid supporters that the race is rigged, reflected in comments online and with political violence increasingly spilling into real life.   ""Bolsonaro is seen as a threat beyond political divergencies, but also to democracy and institutions,"" said Mario Braga, political analyst at Control Risks, adding that it helps explain why da Silva has garnered a bevy of endorsements.   Among the few demographics where Bolsonaro is polling in front are evangelical Christians, who represent nearly a third of the population. Evangelicals helped carry him to power in 2018, and he proceeded to tap members of their churches for important ministries and for a Supreme Court nomination.   Bolsonaro has shored up their support this time around with a campaign to portray the nation as spiritually ill and arguing only he can safeguard the Christian faith. His targeting of da Silva includes linking him to the country's Afro-Brazilian faiths.   Bolsonaro and his supporters have argued this year's polls underestimate the far-right leader's popularity.   ""The ideas of the right have always been ours: family, religion, education, sexual boundaries. ... We are conservative,"" said Maria do Carmo, who will vote for Bolsonaro again on Sunday.   Echoing many other Bolsonaro backers, do Carmo added that she mistrusted polls and the country's electronic voting machines."
64,Hunger returns to haunt Brazil amid divisive vote,"POCO DA CRUZ: In a small cement house crumbling to ruins in  Brazil 's parched Sertao region, Maria da Silva, a graying matriarch struggling to feed her family, opens her empty refrigerator and breaks down in sobs.  The 58-year-old widow, whose creased brown face betrays her burdens, lost her family's main breadwinner when her brother, who worked in Sao Paulo, died of Covid-19 last year.  Now she and her family of eight, who are squatting in an abandoned shack, are among the 33.1 million Brazilians living in hunger.  The figure -- a 73-percent increase in the past two years, according to the Brazilian Network for Research on Food Security -- has become the subject of a bitter political battle as Latin America's biggest economy heads for elections on October 2.  Holding a nearly empty can of powdered milk for the three young grandchildren who live with her, ages three, two and 15 months, Da Silva gives a tour of her dilapidated house, which has no bathroom or running water.  ""There are times when (the children) ask for food and I don't even have a biscuit or bread to give them,"" she says through tears on the small plot of land the family farms in Poco da Cruz, in the northeastern state of Pernambuco.  Soaring food prices have forced the family to turn to begging, she says.  ""I just pray to God to end my suffering.""  The presidential front-runner, leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio  Lula  da Silva, regularly attacks far-right incumbent Jair  Bolsonaro  over the fact Brazil reappeared on the World Food Programme's ""Hunger Map"" last year, with 28.9 percent of the population living in ""moderate or severe food insecurity.""  It is a major setback for a country that had been removed from the map in 2014, after an economic boom and landmark social programs helped lift 30 million people from poverty during Lula's administration (2003-2010).  Bolsonaro has aggressively counter-attacked, accusing Lula of bankrupting Brazil with corruption.  Courting low-income voters, the incumbent has upscaled and rebranded Lula's signature welfare program, and is campaigning extensively in the impoverished northeast, home to a quarter of Brazil's 213 million people.  Sprawled across the northeastern interior, the Sertao, or hinterland, is a semi-arid expanse of brown-and-olive-green scrubland.  Known for cyclical droughts, it is a harsh but beautiful land with an outsize role in Brazilian literature, music and film.  Each generation here remembers its worst drought -- 1960, 1993, 2010 -- and the misery it caused.  Joao Alfredo  de Souza , a community leader in the rural township of Conceicao das Crioulas, weathered all those.  ""It cost us a lot of sweat and tears to overcome,"" says De Souza, a spry 63-year-old who heads a community founded by ex-slaves in the 18th century.  Gesturing from his front porch to a paved street lined with neat, trim houses, De Souza describes Lula's time in office as a watershed of ambitious programs promoting housing, electricity, water, welfare, education and "" Zero Hunger .""  But the retired farmer says times have been ""very tough"" since Covid-19 hit Brazil, killing 680,000 people and triggering an economic implosion followed by soaring inflation.  He says Bolsonaro has won some northeasterners' support by super-sizing Lula's ""Family Stipend"" welfare program -- rebranded ""Auxilio Brasil.""  Bolsonaro recently tripled the average payment from Lula's day, to 600 reais ($115) a month, and is now pledging to increase it to 800 reais.  De Souza is unimpressed by the election-year spending spree.  ""Why is he doing this only now? It's shameful,"" he says.  He says Lula, a Pernambuco native, ""understands the northeast,"" where he leads in the polls in every state.  ""He's one of us.""  A half-hour drive away down a bone-jarring dirt road, in Regiao de Queimadas, a settlement still dotted with traditional mud-and-stick houses, signs of progress are harder to find.  A team of officials in four-by-four trucks from the federal government's National Health Foundation is going door-to-door asking whether people have bathrooms.  Many don't.  ""This place is the Africa of Brazil,"" says one of the officials, reflecting a widespread perception of the region among government bureaucrats in Brazil.  The program's ostensible goal is to build adequate facilities for those who need them.  The head of the local farmers' association, Edineia de Souza, is skeptical.  ""These guys only come around at election time,"" says the 40-year-old corn and bean farmer.  ""We're still waiting on the bathrooms from last time.""  De Souza, who helps organize food donations for needy families with a grass-roots charity called Amigos no Sertao, hopes things will change if Lula wins.  ""When he was in office, projects got done,"" she says.  But she doesn't place much faith in politics.  ""Politicians never even come here,"" she says."
65,"Under Covid lockdown, Xinjiang residents complain of hunger","BEIJING: Residents of a city in Chinaâs far west   region say they are experiencing hunger, forced quarantines and dwindling supplies of medicine and daily necessities after more than 40 days in a virus lockdown. Hundreds of posts from Ghulja riveted users of Chinese social media last week, with residents sharing videos of empty fridges, feverish children, and people screaming from their windows. The dire conditions and food shortages are reminiscent of a harsh  lockdown in Shanghai  this spring, when thousands of residents posted online, complaining they were delivered rotting vegetables or denied critical medical care. But unlike in Shanghai, a glittering, cosmopolitan metropolis of 20 million people and home to many foreigners, the harsh lockdowns in smaller cities such as Ghulja have received less attention. As more infectious variants of the coronavirus creep into China, flare-ups have become increasingly common. Under  China's 'zero-Covid' strategy , tens of millions or people are experiencing rolling lockdowns, paralyzing the economy and making travel uncertain. The  lockdown in Ghulja  is also evoking fears of police brutality among the Uighurs, the Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang. For years, the region has been the target of a sweeping security crackdown, ensnaring huge numbers of Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities in a vast network of camps and prisons. An earlier lockdown in Xinjiang was particularly tough, with forced medication, arrests, and residents being hosed down with disinfectant. Yasinuf, a Uighur studying at a university in Europe, said his mother-in-law sent fearful voice messages this weekend saying she was being forced into centralized quarantine because of a mild cough. The officers coming for her reminded her, she said, of the time her husband was taken to a camp for over two years. âItâs judgement day,â she sighed, in an audio recording reviewed by The Associated Press. âWe donât know whatâs going to happen this time. All we can do now is to trust our creator.â Food has been in short supply. Yasinuf said his parents told him they were running low on food supplies, despite having stocked up before the lockdown. With no deliveries, and barred from using their backyard ovens for fear of spreading the virus, his parents have been surviving on uncooked dough made of flour, water and salt. Yasinuf declined to give his surname for fear of retribution against his relatives. He hasnât been able to study or sleep in recent days, he said, because the thought of his relatives back in Ghulja keeps him up at night. âTheir voices are always in my head, saying things like Iâm hungry, please help us,â he said. âThis is the 21st century, this is unthinkable.â Nyrola Elima, a Uighur from Ghulja, said her father was rationing their dwindling supply of tomatoes, sharing one each day with her 93-year-old grandmother. Another relative, her aunt, was panicking because she lacked milk to feed her 2-year-old grandson. Last week at a news conference, the local governor apologized for âshortcomings and deficienciesâ in the governmentâs response to the coronavirus, alluding to âblind spots and missed spots,"" and promised improvements. But even as authorities acknowledged the complaints, the censors worked to silence them. Posts were wiped from social media. Some videos were deleted and reposted dozens of times as netizens battled censors online. Multiple people in the region told AP the posts online reflected the dire nature of the lockdown, but declined to detail their own situations, saying that they feared retribution. On Monday, local police announced the arrests of six people for âspreading rumorsâ about the lockdown, including posts about a dead child and an alleged suicide, which they said âincited oppositionâ and âdisrupted social order."" Leaked directives from government offices show that workers are being ordered to avoid negative information and spread âpositive energyâ instead. One directed state media to film âsmiling seniorsâ and âchildren having funâ in neighborhoods emerging from the lockdown. âThose who maliciously hype, spread rumors, and make unreasonable accusations should be dealt with in accordance with the law,â one notice warned. The AP was unable to independently verify the notices. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As the authorities mobilize, conditions have improved for some. One resident, reached by phone, said food deliveries resumed after stopping for a couple of weeks. Residents in her compound are now allowed to talk walks in their courtyard for a few hours a day. âThe situation is gradually improving, itâs gotten a lot better,â she said. Authorities have ordered mass testing and district lockdowns in cities across China in recent weeks, from Sanya on tropical Hainan island to southwest Chengdu, to the northern port city of Dalian. In the city of Guiyang, in mountainous southern Guizhou province, a zoo put out a call for help last week, asking for pork, chicken, apples, watermelons, carrots and other produce out of concern they could run out of food for their animals. Elsewhere in the city, residents in one neighborhood complained of hunger and missing food deliveries, prompting a surge of comments online. Local officials apologized, saying that despite their best efforts, they were overwhelmed. âDue to lack of experience and inappropriate methods,â they said in a public notice, âthe supply of basic necessities wasnât enough, bringing inconvenience to everyone. We are deeply sorry.â"
66,"Kolkata: 'Bhookh se Azaadi' drive with 75,000 meals","KOLKATA: Having pledged to serve 75,000 meals in the 75 days leading up to the 75th  ,  IHA Foundation , an organization involved in various community development and philanthropic activities, completed its target ahead of schedule on Saturday.  The food drive has been a part of the programme, 'Freedom from Hunger', organised by  IHA  Foundation to shed light on the persisting malnutrition and hunger crisis widespread in India, even after 75 years of Independence.  Along with the meals served to the underprivileged, essential rations were also delivered to over 7,500 families, the elderly and over 750 underprivileged children.  IHA chairman Satnam  Singh Ahluwalia  has been consistently working towards project  Zero Hunger , with initiatives like Langar on Wheels, which served meals to over thousands of beneficiaries by the end of the first year of Covid. ""We believe that only when we all ensure the people near our homes have their food and nutrition looked after and made self-sustainable, then our nation can be free from hunger,"" said Ahluwalia. He also informed that while the mission's target has been reached, IHA Foundation would carry on with the drive to feed as many malnourished people that come their way. "
67,Naveen Patnaik shares Odishaâs achievements in food security at United Nations World Food Programme,"BHUBANESHWAR: Chief minister   on Friday shared the transformational progress made by Odisha in strengthening livelihoods and food security, with a specific focus on marginalized communities and women, at the United Nations World Food Programme ( WFP ) headquarters in Rome. Naveen, who is currently in Rome at the invitation of the WFP, delivered an address in the presence of WFP executive director  David Beasley  and interacted with senior WFP functionaries on existing partnerships and programmes between Odisha and WFP in India for âZero Hunger.â âOver the last two decades, Odisha has been through a transformational journey in the field of food production, food security, livelihoods, disaster management, and so on. By attaining food sufficiency, initiating large-scale development programmes designed around creating climate resilient livelihoods and nutrition, and focussing on partnerships, the state is moving consistently towards sustainable development goals and inclusive development,â Naveen was quoted by his office as saying at the WFP. âIt would be our pleasure to share our experience across the world through WFP and its partner agencies,â he added. The Chief Minister also expressed appreciation for the partnership with WFP on several fronts that have not only been effective in the state but have also been scaled up nationally. Beasley said the joint goal of strengthening livelihoods and food security across Odisha is being translated into action with a series of ambitious projects to support inclusive development and new economic opportunities, especially for women. âItâs exciting to see how our collaboration is helping to drive Odishaâs progress towards achieving  Zero Hunger  and the other  UN Sustainable Development Goals ,â he said. The WFP executive director said WFP recognizes and appreciates the transformational work of Odisha government in the fields of disaster management, food production, and food security. âThe success story of Odisha can provide learning insights for other similarly placed countries. We have discussed, today, that the Government of Odisha and WFP will collaborate to take forward this learning experience and provide a global training platform,â he added. WFP and the Government of Odisha have signed four partnership agreements and initiated six new projects in 2021. Some of the ongoing work includes the transformation of the public distribution system and paddy procurement, the Grain ATM and smart mobile storage units, the use of evidence on food and nutrition security for planning; programme monitoring partnership with Odisha Millet Mission, secure fishing with fisheries and animal resource development and partnership with the   programme â a formidable network of seven million women formed into six hundred thousand women self-help groups."
68,Tripling RE capacity ok but about phasing out coal,"BATHINDA: The institutions and organisations working into climate change though have welcomed strong support for the  Paris Agreement  and its targets including the 1.5 degree C warming limit mainly tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 and voluntary doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030, the language on   from billions to trillion dollars, making an effort to shift the discourse from mitigation - only finance- to resilience and adaptation but they are pessimistic on no agreement on phasing down  coal . For the first time in  G20 , recognises the quantum for climate finance - gives a figure of USD 5.8-5.9 trillion needed by pre 2030 for NDC achievement, and USD 4 trillion annually for achieving  Net Zero  by 2050, which has been welcomed.  Encourages  capacity by 2030 and voluntary doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030.The agreement to triple renewable energy globally will be a huge boost to the clean energy sector if it can be matched with technology and finance.  - maintains the status quo. G20, home to 93% of global operating coal power plants and 88% of new proposed unabated coal power plants failed to agree to end new coal power plant construction. Recognize the importance of  sustainable biofuels  in zero and low- emission development strategies, and note the setting up of a Global Biofuels Alliance. No specific progress on phase down of coal but announced the establishing of a Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre steered by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and also mentions derivatives like ammonia. Although it recognises the need to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030 (relative to 2019 levels) and notes that global peaking must occur before 2025 (as prescribed by the IPCCâs AR6 Synthesis Report), it mentions that this doesnât imply all countries must peak according to this timeline. This shows that while there is acknowledgement of climate science and policy inputs, principles of CBDR- RC remain alive when it comes to climate action.  Strong support expressed for MDB reforms, including Sustainable Finance Working group recommendations for scaling up blended finance and risk-sharing facilities and the enhanced role of MDBs in mobilising climate finance, especially through concessional resources.  Calls for an ambitious second replenishment process of the Green Climate Fund for its upcoming 2024-2027 programming period  With extreme weather events hitting hard this year, climate change remained high on the geopolitical agenda. There were high expectations, and also differing views on the level of climate action which must be urgently taken across major emitting countries, which include historical emitters like US and Europe but also large economies like China and India. The big climate wins come with the agreement on tripling renewables targets by 2030 and putting a number to the need for climate finance for the first time in G20. The UNFCCCâs first ever Global Stocktake report yesterday reiterated that the window to meet the 1.5 degree C target is closing fast. The Delhi Declaration gives hope towards climate action from the worldâs major emitters responsible for 85% of emissions, however, they missed agreeing on phasing out unabated fossil fuels. Ajay Mathur, Director General, International Solar Alliance (ISA) Through the year, the International Solar Alliance has worked with the G20 Presidency towards fast tracking development, in the G-20 countries and globally, while also mitigating climate change by promoting solar utilization. This can be done in three ways. First, we need to build the knowledge and capacity of all countries to produce, transport and use low and zero carbon hydrogen. ISA has launched the Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre to enable this action. Second, we need to enable solar mini grids to provide universal energy access, especially where grid extension is too expensive. Guarantees help in crowding-in private sector investment into solar mini grids. We need new partnerships â between International Organizations and countries, and in between International Organizations as well, to accelerate solarization. Madhura Joshi, India Lead, E3G, Climate think-tank âWe have seen a landmark decision to support tripling global renewable energy capacity, important for both development and climate goals; support for doubling the rate of energy efficiency, crucial for energy transitions; and for reforming multilateral banks, which can help unlock affordable finance for implementation. Reiterating language from the last G20 on efforts to phase down coal just maintains the status quo. Increasing renewables must be backed by phasing down fossil fuels â both are indispensable for just transitions and a net-zero world. We need stronger bolder action from leaders on both sides. All eyes now on COP28 â can the leaders deliver?â Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends âThe agreement to triple renewable energy globally could be a big boost to the clean energy sector. There is also a pledge to increase the capacity of multilateral development banks to lend more and utilise existing funds better, and a number agreed on the funds required for energy transition but falls short of a clear commitment to increased finance. The language on accelerated phasedown of unabated coal is from last year. In the context of tripling renewable energy, it assumes even greater significance because not calling for phase down of fossil fuels will mean stranded power assets in the near future.ââ Vibhuti Garg, Director, South Asia, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, (IEEFA) âThe Leaders Declaration captures all the ingredients for restricting global temperatures to 1.5 degrees by highlighting the need for countries to develop pathways that are aligned with this goal. It also rightly says the need for tripling of renewable energy and access to low cost finance as the need for finance are estimated to the tune of USD4 trillion annually, the agreement is on facilitating and not committing to it. While the progress is good, a time commitment on both the renewable energy target and allocation of finance to energy and developing countries would have strengthened the commitment from nations on the issue of climate crisis which all the countries have been subjected to.â No further commitment on increasing the availability of finance to developing countries beyond USD 100 billion. The net zero target needs much higher investment and if that commitment is not enhanced, it will be difficult for countries in the global south to achieve their climate goals. On Tripling of Renewable Energy Aditya Lolla, Asia Programme Lead, Ember âThis is a significant and surprising step forward by the G20. A tripling of global renewable capacity by 2030 is the biggest single action that would keep 1.5 degrees within reach. It creates two important precedents. First, it dramatically increases the odds that a global goal to triple renewables can be agreed at COP28 in December. Second, and most importantly, it creates a necessity for countries to go back and reassess their own plans to make sure they are consistent with a tripling of global renewables. Developed countries have a responsibility to help facilitate low-cost financing for renewable energy in emerging countries, so it was great to see the G20 also mention the importance of this. For Saudi Arabia and Russia to now lend support to renewables is welcome. On Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Shruti Sharma, Senior Policy Advisor, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) âThe G20 leaders declaration has acknowledged the significance of addressing fossil fuel subsidies, but there has been no progress in the text since the Bali declaration. For the past 15 years, G20 leaders have consistently reiterated their commitment to reforming fossil fuel subsidies, but failed to deliver tangible progress in terms of transparency, timelines, and subsidies reduction. The absence of a well-defined deadline for phasing out of fossil fuel subsidiesâsuch as 2025 for developed countries and 2030 for emerging economiesâreduces the accountability of the G20 in delivering its 2009 commitment to phase out this support.â On Global Biofuel Alliance Devinder Sharma, Trade and Food Policy Analyst ""At a time when the UN has set a goal to achieve 'Zero Hunger' by 2030, to form a global biofuel alliance would be nothing short of a historic blunder. Political leadership must think of feeding humans first, automobiles can wait. Food should never be diverted for activities which have nothing to do with domestic food security. Interestingly, we are getting to a stage when the food we produce will go to feed automobiles, and it will be left to companies to produce synthetic food in the labs for the human population."" Purva Jain, Energy Analyst, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, (IEEFA) ""The formal launch of the Global Biofuels Alliance at the G20 Summit in Delhi reflects Indiaâs commitment to clean fuels. Archana Chaudhary, Senior independent journalist ââOverall itâs a good move if it helps nations cut reliance on expensive fuel imports. But is not exactly good news for some agricultural economies because it will push farmers to produce more crops that support ethanol and similar biofuels, diverting farm land away from pure food production, affecting food security.ââ "
69,"Social movements, indigenous people oppose UN food systems summit","BATHINDA: Ahead of next weekâs United Nations Food Systems Summit stocktaking event, the largest global food justice movements, small-scale food producer organisations, and Indigenous People have released a new statement denouncing the United Nationsâ approach to tackling hunger and malnutrition. Representatives from the People's Autonomous Response to the  UN Food Systems Summit  (UNFSS) highlighted the urgent, coordinated actions that are needed to overcome the global  hunger crises , and respond to the rights and demands of those most affected by the hunger, climate and health crises.  âThe UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) has not only overlooked our rights and the structural causes of the crises,â says SaÃºl Vicente from the International Indian Treaty Council adding the intention of the Summit organizers is to sell us the corporate and industrial project as transformation. The movements and organizations opposing the Summit call for an urgent shift away from corporate-driven industrial models and towards bio-diverse, agro-ecological, community-led food systems that prioritize the public interest over profit-making.  âThe rights of people to access and control land and productive resources must be guaranteed, and agroecological production models and peasant seeds promoted.â Ibrahima Coulibaly, President of the Network of West African Farmers and Agricultural Producersâ Organizations (ROPPA) Two years ago, the UN Summit sparked an unprecedented global counter mobilization. The main concern of the Summitâs critics was â and remains â the escalating influence of corporations and their proxy organizations within the United Nations.  âDonât appoint the goat as gardener, a peasant proverb saysâ, Patti Naylor from the National Family Farm Coalition warns: âThe corporate agriculture, food and data giants donât care about democratic governance in the UN â they just use it for their profits. Like the goat, corporations will eat the salad and the roses, if you donât stop themâ. Real food systems change for people and the planet is urgently needed and possible, but with the current hunger figures, the UN will not meet their Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030. This ongoing and systemic crisis is a product of policy failures and omissions, and a result of pursuing a problematic path that leads to the exacerbation of inequalities and dependencies, destruction of environments and biodiversity, and spillover effects aggravating the global debt and  climate crises .  âOver the past two decades, people from all over the world have presented concrete, effective strategies for addressing the climate and food crises based on respect for social and racial diversity, justice, and human and collective rights. Foremost among these are  food sovereignty , agroecology, revitalisation of biodiversity, territorial markets and a solidarity-based economy,â says Shalmali Guttal, from Focus on the Global South. âThe evidence is overwhelming â the solutions devised by small-scale food producers and  Indigenous Peoples  not only feed the world but also advance gender, social, economic justice, youth empowerment, workersâ rights and real resilience to crises. Why are policy makers not listening to them and providing them with adequate support?â A new FIAN report released in parallel to the statement âFood Systems Transformation -- In which directionâ, calls for an urgent overhaul of the global food governance architecture to guarantee decision-making that prioritizes the public good and the right to food for all. âThe communities in the front lines of the food crisis are being used by corporations as an alibi to increase profits. The tragedy is that policy makers at the food system summit are ignoring social movementsâ far more effective ideas about how to end hunger.â Raj Patel âIn these times of growing hunger and multiple crises, it is more urgent than ever that governments and the UN listen to usâ says Perla Ãlvarez from La VÃ­a Campesina. âWe call on you: change direction, and support our demands and efforts for a food sovereign future based on human rights and the principles of agroecology, care, justice, diversity, solidarity and accountability.â"
70,A bond of love: How pets affect our well-being,"The bond between people and animals has been strong for eternity, as is also illustrated in ancient sculptures, carvings, and murals of various cultures. It is a fact that  pets  offer more than just companionship. Over the past three decades of research, it has been discovered that animals have a long-lasting and deep influence on our mental as well as physical wellness. In this article, Dr. Anureet Sethi, Chairperson Co-founder at Trijog â Know Your Mind Pvt. Ltd., shares how pets can enhance our  well-being : Whether playing fetch, taking a long walk, or simply sitting together, pets leave you feeling loved and happy. Studies conducted worldwide have long established that being around furry friends has a two-pronged effect on our brains. The first is the decrease in cortisol, or the stress hormone, due to interaction with pets, which lowers blood pressure. Secondly, being with your pet prompts the release of oxytocin by your brain, a chemical which has popularly been called the 'love hormone'. Many hospitals and health professionals are using  pet therapy  as an effective and impactful mode to hasten the healing of patients. Pets are like emotional anchors in today's fast-moving, busy world where more people are becoming disengaged from each other. They elicit mindfulness and are an essential component of well-being because they make humans live in the present by providing a grounding influence. Their need for care promotes empathy and provides an opportunity to destress. Small and simple acts like stroking a pet's head, cuddling them, playing with them, or just seeing a fish swim around can help lower your anxiety and help induce calmness in your daily life by replacing negativity with positivity. This is particularly useful for trauma patients, the elderly, children, and especially beneficial to those struggling with severe mental challenges.  The daily routine of living with a pet can be extremely rewarding and satisfying. Taking them on daily walks has physical benefits - not only do you stay fit, it can also lead to new friendships that can help you socially. Unlike complex relationships, pets are not judgemental and provide unconditional support whether you are a success or failure. This provides an emotional safety net where an individual can express themselves freely, which helps build psychological wellness. Their presence helps ease social burden and act like a stabilizing force that cultivates emotional balance and well-being.  Humans keep pets for various reasons, such as companionship, service dogs to help with illness, watchdogs, and more. Whatever the reason, the profound impact of a pet on the well-being of a human goes beyond these reasons. The gratification that a companion animal delivers is like none other. In today's era, families are becoming smaller, and pets are integral to the family. There is a reason why pet owners call themselves âpet parentsâ. Their presence gives a sense of purpose and routine that elevates psychological well-being and resilience.  It is not necessary to always use verbal communication to elevate a personâs mood or  mental health . Non-verbal communication, like a lick or a snuggle by your little friend can significantly elevate one's mood, leading to a deeply satisfying life and balanced mental health. The welcome you get when you return home from a hard day at work is usually reward enough for the work you need to put in to maintain your pet. If you have a pet, count your blessings, and if you donât have one- you must explore adopting a pet to make your life happy and complete."
71,Workplace Wellness: How employers can promote mental health and reduce stress-related risks,"""As the societies have evolved, so have the stressors and this has resulted in a very different set of problems being faced by employees of today. India is experiencing several unfortunate events where employees are succumbing to a toxic mix of extreme stress both at workplace and beyond,"" says Jitin Bhasin, CEO and Founder, SaveIN. In this article, he writes about how employers can promote better  mental health  at their workplace and reduce  stress-related risks  for their employees. He adds, the stark reality of todayâs fast paced, ever connected world with relentless pressure to meet targets and stiff deadlines is taking a toll on the physical and mental well-being of employees and thereby their productivities at work. Data also shows that there is a worrying correlation between chronic workplace stress and rising incidents of health-related complications causing premature deaths. As this issue assumes greater importance, it is critical to assess the deep impact of workplace stress on an employeeâs health and the need for organizations to prioritize mental wellness. While a set of companies in India offer  corporate health insurance  to their employees, it is no longer enough to offer only hospitalization coverage; the focus needs to be on preventive care, elective treatments, work-life balance, and overall  wellness programs  with inbuilt response mechanisms to deal with emergency situations. To build effective wellness programs that would be relevant for today, companies should start by listing comprehensive health initiatives that can be undertaken commensurate to resources that can be allocated. These programs should be well-planned, with dedicated teams and must involve the managerial and leadership teams along with HR function, to ensure they are both sustainable and impactful. A wellness program designed for the needs of today should go beyond hospitalization coverage and must address day-to-day well-being, including physical fitness, mental health, preventive check-ups and elective treatments. It has been observed that including health and wellness as a Key Performance Indicator within an employeeâs performance assessment, along with offering incentives for fitness goals, encouraging planned vacations, and promoting healthy work habits can go a long way in making wellness a mainstream subject in an organization. Encouraging walking meetings, team activities, healthy food options, and support for families like daycare or elder care services can also be significant additions to wellness programs. Employees face enhanced stress on account of business targets, personal challenges, long commutes, constant digital connectivity, and sedentary lifestyles. Organizations and managers can make a significant difference by setting realistic goals, holding periodic discussions and performance improvement exercise, offering structured breaks, and career planning sessions. A  hybrid work system , that balances on-site and work from home can also be a great way to enable employees to manage work and life commitments. Additionally, there are new age AI-based tools which can be used to monitor  employee well-being  and providing access to professional counsellors where needed.  In the event of an unforeseen event, safety protocols also become equally important; employers should establish emergency plans, install first aid kits and defibrillators, and train staff to handle health emergencies such as heart attacks or strokes. It is important for the leadership teams to realize that promoting a culture of health and fitness is a constant commitment that needs to be led by the those in the capacity to influence change. By focusing on these areas, companies can create a healthier workplace with highly productive and happy workforce.  Prioritizing  employee health  may seem difficult and expensive in the near term, but has a compounding impact in the medium to long term and it is time that India Inc. embraces this fact and makes a step in the right direction."

75,Astrology and Mental Health: How the Planets Impact Emotional Well-being in a Post-Pandemic World,"In a world forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have turned to  astrology  for guidance, particularly when it comes to  mental health  and  emotional well-being . As we collectively recover from the emotional turbulence of the past few years, the cosmic movements of the planets are being examined with greater interest. Astrology offers a unique lens to understand not only personal mental health struggles but also collective emotional shifts. How exactly do the planets play a role in influencing our moods, emotions, and mental resilience in this  post-pandemic  landscape?  Each planet in astrology governs different areas of life and influences particular emotions. The Moon, for example, is known to be the ruler of our emotional landscape, moods, and inner feelings. It shifts every two to three days, making it a key player in our day-to-day emotional fluctuations. After months of isolation, fear, and uncertainty during the pandemic, many have become more in tune with their emotional cycles, looking to the  Moon  for clarity. New Moons and Full Moons are especially significant as they mark times of new beginnings and emotional culmination, respectively.  Meanwhile, the outer planets, like Saturn and  Pluto , which take years to move through a sign, are associated with longer-term cycles of transformation and healing. Saturn, known as the taskmaster planet, can signify challenges and restrictions. During the pandemic, Saturn's transit through Capricorn and Aquarius reflected the isolation, structure, and responsibility that defined this era. However, its placement in a birth chart can also point to how an individual manages discipline, resilience, and recovery. For many, recognizing these patterns has helped them navigate difficult emotions during lockdowns and restrictions.  Neptune, the planet of dreams, illusions, and healing, has played a profound role in post-pandemic emotional recovery. Often associated with spirituality and introspection, Neptune encourages people to escape from the harsh realities of life through creativity, imagination, or spiritual practice. As the world adjusted to a new normal, many found solace in these areas, from reconnecting with creative hobbies to exploring meditation, yoga, and astrology itself.  Pluto, the planet of transformation and rebirth, is equally important in understanding how the pandemic has led to personal and societal transformation. It governs deep psychological shifts, unearthing trauma and buried emotions that need to be confronted for growth. The post-pandemic world has seen a rise in mental health awareness, therapy, and self-care practices. Many individuals have experienced deep emotional shifts, with Pluto guiding them through phases of destruction and rebuilding. Astrology offers insight into how these processes unfold on both an individual and collective level.  Ah, Mercury retrogradeâthe astrological phenomenon that most people associate with chaos and confusion. Mercury, the planet of communication, thinking, and mental processes, goes retrograde three or four times a year, often throwing peopleâs minds into a whirlwind. While Mercury retrograde can disrupt technology and communication, it also presents an opportunity for reflection and introspection, particularly regarding mental clarity. During the pandemic, when uncertainty reigned, Mercury retrogrades offered moments to step back, reanalyze, and process what was happening around us.  Post-pandemic, these retrograde cycles can be seen as an invitation to reassess how we communicate, cope, and think about mental health. Mercury retrograde has helped many individuals take a pause and reflect on how they manage stress, anxiety, and emotional overload.  Jupiter, the planet of expansion, optimism, and growth, plays a crucial role in balancing the emotional challenges brought by the pandemic. Its energy promotes hope, positivity, and emotional resilience. Jupiter transits often align with moments of personal growth, encouraging us to expand our perspectives and embrace new experiences. In a post-pandemic world, Jupiterâs influence is a reminder to seek joy, practice gratitude, and focus on emotional abundance after a period of fear and contraction.  For those looking for mental health guidance through astrology, Jupiter can offer insights into how to nurture  emotional growth  and recovery, whether through therapy, mindfulness practices, or simply embracing hope for the future.  Astrology doesnât replace professional mental health care, but it does offer a unique way to understand emotional patterns and navigate lifeâs challenges. For those who feel overwhelmed by the post-pandemic world, the planets provide a symbolic map for emotional well-being and healing. As we continue to rebuild and recover, the stars remind us that emotional shifts are cyclical, and with each planetary movement, we are offered new opportunities for growth, healing, and emotional clarity. In these times, looking up to the cosmos can be a grounding and empowering experience."

99,Only 26.8% of Indian youth in the academic age group have internet browsing skills: Can this impact quality education?,"A recent survey conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) under its Comprehensive Annual Modular Survey (CAMS) has revealed troubling data regarding the digital capabilities of India's youth. Less than one-third of individuals in the 15-29 age group can perform basic internet functions such as searching for information, sending or receiving emails, and conducting online transactions. This critical finding exposes a significant digital divide in India, a country where access to the internet is increasingly synonymous with access to quality education and knowledge. The survey highlights three key age groups: 15-24 years, 15-29 years, and individuals aged 15 and above. The results show significant variation between urban and rural populations, with urban males leading in digital proficiency while rural females lag far behind. As per the report, only 26.8% of persons aged 15-24, 28.5% of those aged 15-29, and 25.0% of individuals aged 15 and above can simultaneously search for information online, send or receive emails, and perform online banking transactions. The gender divide is particularly stark, with only 14.5% of rural women aged 15-29 being able to perform these tasks. The report also underscores large state-wise disparities, with states like Goa and Kerala performing much better than regions such as Meghalaya and Tripura, where less than 10% of young people can complete these basic digital tasks. These findings reflect not only on the digital gap but also raise concerns about how this divide may be impacting the quality of education in different parts of India. While the national average of students who can browse the internet, send emails, and conduct online transactions stands at a mere 28.5% in the 15-29 age group, some states show relatively better performance. Goa leads with 65.7% of young people being able to perform these tasks, followed by Kerala (53.4%), Tamil Nadu (48%), and Telangana (47.2%). Here is a look at the state-wise internet skill levels of the Indian population. On the other end of the spectrum, Meghalaya has the lowest share (7.5%) of individuals capable of using these essential digital skills, followed by Tripura (8.2%), Chhattisgarh (11.9%), and Uttar Pradesh (16%). This disparity not only reflects varying levels of internet access but also reveals significant gaps in digital literacy and educational opportunities between states. The digital divide in India, as reflected in these statistics, highlights the urgent need for improving digital literacy across the country. Without this, many students risk being left behind in the rapidly evolving world of technology and education. The internet is a powerful tool that can drastically enhance the quality of education in several ways. Here are a few ways in which digital literacy can contribute to improved education: The internet provides access to a wide array of resources that students can use for self-study. Educational websites, research papers, and online libraries offer information on every subject imaginable. This access can supplement traditional classroom learning and provide students with in-depth knowledge. Online platforms can provide personalised educational experiences. Adaptive learning technologies help students focus on their weaknesses and strengths, offering tailored resources to help them understand complex subjects at their own pace. The internet facilitates collaboration between students, teachers, and experts from across the globe. Students can participate in forums, share ideas, and collaborate on projects with their peers, enhancing their learning experiences and helping them build networks beyond their immediate surroundings.  Many reputed universities and educational institutions offer free or affordable online courses. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other educational platforms such as Coursera and edX provide students in remote areas with the opportunity to access high-quality education, levelling the playing field. With the rapid digitisation of industries, students who are proficient in digital skills have a competitive advantage in the job market. Learning to navigate the internet effectively and mastering online tools is crucial for preparing students for future employment opportunities in a technology-driven world. In the context of a globalised education system and an increasingly competitive academic environment, the ability to browse the internet is indispensable for students. Here are a few reasons why this is so: In an era of globalisation, students in India must compete with their peers worldwide. Access to online resources allows them to keep up with international academic standards, stay informed about global trends, and gain knowledge that is relevant across borders. Browsing the internet helps students carry out independent research, which is essential for academic excellence. In todayâs world, research is no longer limited to textbooks; it involves reading papers, exploring academic journals, and staying updated on the latest developments in various fields. Many students in India prepare for competitive exams, and the internet provides access to past papers, mock tests, and educational resources that can help them succeed. Furthermore, it offers platforms where students can enrol in exam-specific coaching, improving their chances of success. With rapid advancements in technology, staying up-to-date with the latest tools and platforms is essential. From learning coding languages to mastering digital tools, the internet provides a wealth of resources that are critical for students in technical and scientific fields. Regular browsing of the internet exposes students to diverse viewpoints and problem-solving approaches. By interacting with different sources of information, students can develop critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential for both academic and professional success."

102,Overburdened professors affect quality of education at Rudrapurâs SBS Degree College,"Rudrapur: Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Degree College in  Rudrapur  is grappling with a severe shortage of teaching staff, impacting the quality of higher education. With over 8,000 students enrolled, the college has only 52 sanctioned posts for professors, leaving each professor responsible for more than 160 studentsâdouble the   (UGC) standard of one professor for 80 students. The situation is particularly dire in the science departments, where the outdated UGC norm of one professor for every 60 students has become unsustainable. Many education experts now suggest updating the standard to one professor per 50 students to better reflect current needs. ""This puts an immense strain on both professors and students,"" said Principal Sarvjit Singh. ""Our faculty members are forced to conduct both morning and afternoon classes, leaving little room for personalised attention."" Out of the 52 sanctioned posts, 40 are filled by regular faculty, while 12 are covered by contractual staff. However, with three positions currently vacant, only 49 professors are left to handle the overwhelming student body. Singh said that despite repeated requests to the university administration, no action has been taken to address the staffing crisis. Lavneet Singh, an undergraduate student, expressed frustration over the impact on education quality. ""The large class sizes make it difficult for professors to effectively manage their workload across two shifts, diminishing the overall learning experience. Both students and teachers are being let down by an outdated system that fails to meet modern educational demands,"" he said."

Itâs an attempt to do in sales and service what it has already kicked off in manufacturing â bring in  gender equality  across its operations, including in blue-collar jobs.  âWe envision having 50% women in our workforce across all divisions by 2047,â says V G Sakthikumar, CMD, Schwing Stetter India. âInspiring the next generation of women engineers and technicians is pivotal to shaping Indiaâs infrastructure landscape, and we want to lead the way,â he adds.  At the new service centre, the all-women team will service and overhaul a range of concrete pumps and mixers. Their responsibilities will include everything from troubleshooting component malfunctions and carrying out preventive maintenance to providing comprehensive machine servicing. Since the inauguration of the service centre, three machines have been serviced, including two seven-cubic-metre transit mixers and one stationary pump.  âThe requirements for the machines have been gearbox and hydraulic system related,â said a member of the Poonamallee team. The work includes taking out workable parts from old machines and re-incorporating them into a new one as part of the refurbishment process.  âThe  all-women service centre  is a testament to our belief in the capabilities of women in manufacturing and infrastructure sectors,â says Sakthikumar. âWe wanted to show that a  construction equipment  company can have part of its operations run entirely by women,â he adds.  The company has also been steadily increasing the number of women in its factory floor operations. âOur new plant at Sipcot Cheyyar started operations in 2021, and already women make up 28% of our factory assembly line,â he says. Of them, 70% are from Tamil Nadu, while the rest are from Kerala, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal.  Currently, welding, assembly line, quality, service, and spares divisions have all become gender neutral. The company also invites top engineering institutions such as VIT, SRM, and Anna University to offer engineering courses and degree certification on its premises, allowing a section of the women workforce to become fullfledged engineers as well.  âThe factory experience with the women workforce has been very good, with one woman employee winning the national award for welding as well,â says Sakthikumar. âWhat we started in production three years ago, we are now expanding to sales and service as well,â he adds.  Will Schwing Stetter have more all-women service centres? The company aims to open similar facilities across India, and the numbers will depend upon customer feedback. âIf the customer experience is good, we will take this concept forward very quickly,â says Sakthikumar.  Like the factory workers â who have a womenâs hostel nearby and company buses for commute â the service centre is also incorporating a women-friendly work environment, from sanitary pad vending machines to the centre itself being conveniently located next to the Tuticorin bypass.  The company provides transportation and other support services, including on-site medical assistance. In the typically macho world of the big yellow machines, the women of Poonamallee are pioneers of sorts."
115,"1 year on, BHU suspends 13 who stood against gangrape on campus","VARANASI: Nearly a year after an  IIT-BHU  student was allegedly gang-raped on the campus, 13 students of the university have been suspended for 15 to 30 days for ""indiscipline"" and ""disruption of the academic environment"" during a protest over the incident last year. BHU spokesperson  Rajesh Singh  said the action was taken on the recommendation of the university's probe committee. The suspension order was issued on Sep 26. Those suspended include members of various student organisations. Protesting the suspensions, a group of students submitted a memorandum to BHU administration on Thursday, demanding immediate revocation of the order. They warned of a protest if the suspensions were not revoked. Terming the university's action ""a vile attempt to intimidate students"", a suspended student said ""we will continue to be vocal on issues of  women's safety  and  gender equality "". Meanwhile, a group of Congress-backed NSUI members claimed they went to the parliamentary office of PM Narendra Modi in Varanasi to submit a memorandum in protest against the suspensions, but the administration refused to accept it. ""We were stopped under govt pressure and the memorandum was not accepted. In protest, we tore the memorandum in front of the administration, and announced that we would be compelled to stage a bigger protest,"" said NSUI's eastern UP president, Rishabh Pandey. Congress, too, condemned the university's move. City Congress president Raghvendra Chaubey alleged that the accused in the gang rape case, out on bail, openly campaigned in the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections for two months, while students protesting against the criminals had been suspended.  The survivor had alleged that she had gone out of her hostel with a friend on the night of Nov 1, when three men came on a motorcycle, forcibly took her to a corner and gagged her after separating from her friend. The accused then allegedly stripped her, made a video of her and clicked photos.Three accused - Kunal Pandey, Abhishek Chauhan and Saksham Patel - were arrested in the case."
116,'Doug Emhoff became enraged and slapped ex-girlfriend Jane',"Vice President  's husband,  Doug Emhoff , was alleged to have assaulted his ex-girlfriend in a violent altercation, according to three friends who spoke to DailyMail.com. Emhoff reportedly struck the woman so forcefully that she spun around while they were waiting in a valet line after attending a 2012  Cannes Film Festival  event in France. One friend shared that the woman, referred to under the pseudonym ' Jane ', called him immediately after the incident, crying in a cab and recounting the assault. A second friend recalled that Jane had mentioned the violence at the time, and a third noted that Jane first spoke about her relationship with Emhoff in 2014, recounting the full story of the alleged abuse in 2018, coinciding with then-Senator Harrisâs involvement in the Senate hearings concerning Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The three friends, who provided photos and documents to support Jane's story, described the incident in which Emhoff allegedly became enraged over perceived flirting and slapped Jane in the face after they both had been drinking. The friends further revealed that Jane had spoken of Emhoffâs past, including an affair with his daughterâs nanny, which had resulted in a pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage. Emhoff reportedly paid the nanny a settlement and had her sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Despite this, Emhoff continued to present himself in public as an ally to women and a supporter of their rights, which the friends found hypocritical given his alleged past behaviour. Jane's friends felt it was important to bring these allegations to light, as they believed the public deserved to know more about Emhoff's true character, especially in light of his prominent public role and the image of benevolence promoted by the Harris campaign. However, Jane herself has declined to comment on the matter. The alleged incident took place in May 2012 during the Cannes Film Festival in France. Doug Emhoff and his then-girlfriend, referred to as 'Jane', had attended a high-profile event, the Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) Gala Dinner at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes, southern France. After the event, while they were waiting in a valet line, Emhoff allegedly became enraged, believing Jane was flirting with a valet attendant, and slapped her violently across the face. Both had reportedly been drinking at the time. The accusations are being made indirectly by Janeâs three close friends, who have come forward to share what Jane confided to them about the alleged assault. Jane herself, a successful  New York attorney , has not commented publicly. The three friends provided DailyMail.com with corroborating evidence, including photos of Emhoff and Jane together during that time and other communications. They chose to speak out anonymously due to fears of retaliation. Mainstream media has consistently portrayed Doug Emhoff in a positive light. He is frequently described as a 'wife guy' who is deeply supportive of his spouse, Vice President Kamala Harris. Emhoff has cultivated an image of being an ally to women, speaking out against  toxic masculinity  and positioning himself as an advocate for  gender equality . For example, during a recent interview with MSNBCâs Jen Psaki, he was praised for reshaping public perceptions of masculinity. This benevolent image has been carefully nurtured through media interviews, portraying him as a modern, progressive partner and a strong supporter of womenâs rights. These allegations could be damaging to Kamala Harrisâs image as a staunch advocate for womenâs rights and gender equality. Harris has built much of her political identity on supporting women, speaking out against sexual violence, and advocating for victims of abuse. The accusations against Emhoff, however, create a stark contrast between his public image as a supporter of women and the private actions described by Janeâs friends. If the allegations gain wider attention, it could raise questions about Harrisâs credibility as a pro-woman candidate. "

Currently captivating viewers as Saroj in  Saajha Sindoor , she recently shared how her parents' relentless support has shaped her personal and professional journey, helping her achieve success in life. Opening up about the support she received from her parents, Sangita Ghosh shared, ""My parents, I think, managed that beautifully. They never questioned me about anything and gave me a lot of freedom and liberty, which is why I am where I am today. I'm happy in life, and my thinking and outlook have developed in a way that they never drew distinctions between a boy and a girl."" She further added, ""My brother and I were raised equally. I was never asked to do certain things just because I was a girl, nor was he treated differently. For instance, he wasnât told to go out and play while I was expected to stay home and focus on other things. It was never like that. I remember playing cricket, kabaddi, and football with the boys. They never imposed restrictions on me because of my gender. Whether it was my studies, wanting to work, or going out, they always trusted me. They never questioned me for coming home late or for having male friends in my circle. Because of the freedom they gave me, I became much more responsible. For that, Iâm incredibly grateful. They allowed me to live my life freely with them, and I feel truly blessed to have such parents."" The Saajha Sindoor actress also reflected on how relationships between parents and children have evolved. She shared, ""These days, it's common for parents to want to be friends with their children, probably to break that barrier or thaw the ice, or however you'd describe it. But Iâm not sure how Iâll be with my daughter as she grows up. That said, I believe thereâs a very fine line to maintain. You have to be a parent first, before anything else."" Sangita, who plays Saroj, the stepmother to Gagan (played by Sahil Uppal) in Saajha Sindoor, also discussed the difficult decision she made to leave her daughter behind for the role. ""It wasnât just about playing a negative character. There were many factors, especially thinking about my daughter. I had to leave her in Jaipur while I travelled to Mumbai, so I wanted to make sure the role was truly worth it. I had immense trust in the team, and thatâs ultimately why I chose to move forward with it."" Saajha Sindoor, airing at 8 PM, explores the grandeur and complex relationships within a  royal family  in  , featuring Stuti Vinkle, Sangita Ghosh, Sahil Uppal, Neelu Vaghela, and Krutika Desai."
120,"Will withdraw duty-hour curbs on women, WB says after SC rap","NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday took exception to the gender-discriminatory circular of the  West Bengal health department , issued 10 days after a woman doctor's rape-murder on Aug 9 night at the RG Kar Hospital, advising hospitals to limit  women doctors ' duty to 12 hours and avoid assigning them night duties. A bench of  CJI D Y Chandrachud  and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the West Bengal govt, how a state could impose such restrictions on women doctors when women as pilots and as part of the armed forces are doing duties in the night. ""How can you discriminate against women, and suggest to govt medical colleges and hospitals to assign only 12-hour duty to women doctors, when their male counterparts would be doing 36 hours of continuous duty,"" the CJI-led bench asked. An unflinching advocate of  gender equality  both in his judgments and speeches delivered outside the court, the CJI said, ""Women professionals do not want concession. They want equal opportunity with security. If it is a 12-hour shift, let it be for all resident doctors irrespective of their gender. The state govt must correct this circular."" Even though the circular was not mandatory but in the shape of an advisory, Sibal and advocate Astha Sharma said the circular will be amended and these two clauses, objected to by the court and the resident doctors, would be withdrawn. The bench cited the SC's judgment in the Anuj Garg case which involved a challenge to the validity of Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act prohibhiting the employment of women on premises (bars) where people consume liquor or intoxicating drugs. In the 2007 judgment, SC ruled that ""instead of prohibiting women employment in the bars altogether the state should focus on factoring in ways through which unequal consequences of sex differences can be eliminated"". ""It is the state's duty to ensure circumstances of safety which inspire confidence in women to discharge the duty freely in accordance with the requirements of the profession they choose to follow,"" SC had ruled. Deprecating the Delhi govt's opposition to employment of women in bars citing the Jessica Lal murder case, SC had had allowed men and women below the age of 25 to take up jobs in bars, saying these youngsters graduate in hotel management courses at the age of 22 or 23 years and cannot be prohibited from taking employment in the relevant industry."
121,Schools slow to form Sakhi Savitri committee for studentsâ wellbeing,"Pune: There has reportedly been slow progress in formation of the  Sakhi Savitri committee  in schools, despite the govt issuing guidelines last month. The state education department said the committee is responsible for students' safety and well-being and to ensure  gender equality . It was being established in over 4,861 primary and secondary schools in the district. The Sakhi Savitri committees would act as a vital platform to address concerns and challenges students faced on school premises. Education department officials said schools had been sent reminders to form the committee at the earliest and submit information regarding it. Additionally, the committee would offer counselling sessions to students and parents to raise awareness about govt education schemes and provide career guidance. It would also conduct self-defence training programmes for girls and ensure a healthy and abuse-free environment in schools for boys and girls â protecting students from harassment and discrimination. Joint director of the state education department Dilip D Jagdale said, ""Some schools have been lazy to form the committees, while some have done it but not reported back. We have appealed schools to ensure the guidelines are followed diligently and there are no lapses."" The Sakhi Savitri committee would also assist dropout students to re-enter the education system, promote healthy habits, raise awareness about risks of child marriage and support education of children from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The committee was expected to hold monthly meetings, create awareness about the e-box facility created by the national commission for protection of  child rights  under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, the Chirag app and the 1098 child helpline number. The education department made it mandatory for all schools in Maharashtra to set up the committee with immediate effect following outrage over the alleged sexual abuse of two kindergarten girls at a school in Badlapur in Aug."

123,"75+ Happy Daughter's Day Messages, Greetings, Wishes, and Quotes for 2024","National Daughterâs Day is a celebration dedicated to appreciating and honouring the contributions, influence, and impact of daughters in the lives of people. This year, the festival falls on September 22. This nationwide celebration is a tribute to daughters who go the extra mile for their families and become strong figures within them. In a patriarchal society, boys are traditionally seen as the heirs of the family, the gender that will carry forward the family name. However, times have changed, and daughters are no longer seen as a burden but as a blessing for families. People now know that daughters can be relied upon, not just for emotional support but also for financial needs. Daughters bring joy, creativity, compassion, and love to a family. They teach us how to be sympathetic and kind. This day is also a testament to the changing times and the dying of old stereotypes that reduced daughters and women to mere props and decorations.  Gender equality  is a reality and one that wonât ever be pushed into darkness again. Equality begins right at home. Whether through heartfelt notes, gifts, or wishes, we should all take the time to celebrate the irreplaceable roles of daughters and women in our lives on this day.

124,Mindset must change from making concessions for women to recognising their entitlements: CJI,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India,  DY Chandrachud , delivered a powerful keynote address at the  SheShakti  event in New Delhi on September 16, 2024, organized by a media outlet. He emphasized the need for society to move beyond making concessions for women and, instead, to recognize their  entitlements . Addressing the larger issue of  women's rights  and safety,   Chandrachud pointed out that while legal provisions exist to safeguard women's interests in both public and private spaces, changing societal mindsets is crucial for real justice. He opened his address by discussing the broad challenges facing women today, which include the need for equal opportunities and dignity. The CJI stressed that women's rights are not just a women's issue, highlighting how he had personally learned valuable lessons from his female colleagues. CJI Chandrachud referenced the important role women have played in shaping India's rights framework, mentioning feminist Hansa Mehta, who drafted the Indian Women's Charter of Life before the adoption of the Indian Constitution. He further stated that women's equal participation in governance and leadership roles leads to better development outcomes. However, to achieve this, the ongoing issue of gendered domestic labour must be addressed. For true  gender equality , the focus must be on leveling the playing field and understanding women's lived realities, beyond just statistical representation."
125,Kings & queens glam up to spark social change,"By day they are tech professionals and entrepreneurs; by night they are dazzling queens and kings, donning glittering outfits, vibrant wigs, and bold makeup. Meet Hyderabadâs  drag artists  who are trying to make a difference in society by initiating critical conversations â from politics to  gender equality ,  queer rights , and  civic duty  â one performance at a time. Among them is  Patruni Sastry , a 32-year-old IT professional who has been performing as a drag queen since 2018, the same year they came out as non-binary-trans bisexual. On stage, Patruni is popular as Sas. âDrag is an art form that involves dressing in clothing, jewellery, makeup, and wigs of a different gender and performing for entertainment,â Sas explains, carefully blending eyeshadows to perfect their look. âMost individuals turn into drag queens by adopting highly feminine personas, while some performers transform into drag kings with exaggerated male personas.â Sasâ love for makeup and flamboyant clothing dates back to their early days as a trained Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam dancer. âI always loved putting on makeup and wearing exaggerated clothes, but there were limitations in the costumes for male classical dancers compared to female dancers,â they recall. âIt took me a while to come to terms with my identity, and in 2018, I finally came out to my family. My life has completely changed since then. Drag has taught me to go out there and feel completely free and at peace,â adds Sas, whose performances largely hinge on civic duty, issues of the queer community such as adoption, samesex marriages, and more. But off-stage, Sas is a family person. âIâm married and have a one-yearold son. We lead a normal life. My wife and son even accompany me to all my shows,â they add. Another prominent figure in the cityâs drag scene is Aryan Patra â  KHeMaya  on stage. Her story started from begging on the streets of Bhubaneswar to becoming Odishaâs first trans drag artist. Now, sheâs making her mark in Hyderabad. âI left my village at the age of 14 and joined a  transgender community  in Bhubaneswar, where I started begging,â she recounts, her glittering outfit catching the light as she speaks. âI always loved dressing up as a woman, and I saved every bit of money I earned from begging to join a makeup course. From there, I never looked back.  I was always fond of dancing, as Iâm also a trained Odissi dancer. But after joining the trans community, my passion for dance took a back seat.â Inspired by the Indian drag artist and actor Sushant Divgikar, aka Rani Kohinoor, KHeMaya began exploring drag in Bhubaneswar before moving to Hyderabad. âI researched what Sushant was doing and started performing in Bhubaneswar. After moving to Hyderabad, I contacted the drag community here.  I have done over 100 shows to create awareness about the transgender community, their problems like reservation, employment, etc.,â she says. Perfecting her eyeliner â matching each wing with precision â she goes on to explain the significance of KHeMaya. âK stands for Kalingaâthe ancient name of my homeland; He represents the identity I was born with; and Maya means the attractiveness of your talent.â According to these artists, Hyderabadâs drag scene is still in its infancy, with only six active performers who bring their art to life during weekends at various stand-up shows, open mics, and queer community events across the country. âCities like Mumbai and Bengaluru have embraced drag on a larger scale, with each city boasting around 20 drag artists,â shares Hephzibah Smith, known as Firangi Local, an entrepreneur and drag king. âDelhi has about as many artists as Hyderabad, while Chennai has two or three.â Smith is relatively new to the drag scene but is determined to make her mark. However, Smith acknowledges the challenges the community faces in Hyderabad. âWhen we talk about drag, people donât understand what it is.  There are still only a handful of places in the city that allow us to perform.â Sas shares the same sentiment, pointing to the scarcity of opportunities as a reason for the limited number of active drag artists in Hyderabad. Despite these hurdles, Sas and their fellow performers are committed to creating an economy and environment where drag is respected and invested in. âMany people think weâre trying to be too Westernized, but drag has deep roots in Indian culture,â says KHeMaya. âIn Odisha, we have a dance form called Gotipua, where men dress up as women. Even in Lavni, men used to wear Paithani and dance. My grandfather used to tell me that in villages, men played all the female roles, including Sita in the Ramayana. This is an Indian art form, and we will make it big one day,â KHeMaya adds."

Through the pioneering efforts of Sail Training Ships INS Tarangini and INS Sudarshini and  circumnavigation  onboard INSVs Mhadei and Tarini, the Indian Navy has taken a centre stage in  Ocean Sailing  expeditions. Continuing with the celebration of maritime skill and adventure, two Indian Navy  women officers  Lt Cdr Roopa A and Lt Cdr Dilna K would be embarking on the extraordinary expedition of circumnavigating the globe - Navika  Sagar Parikrama  II onboard  INSV Tarini  very shortly.The duo have been preparing themselves for this expedition for the last three years. The officers as part of the six member crew had participated in trans-oceanic expedition from Goa to Rio de Janeiro via Cape Town and back last year. Thereafter, the officers undertook a  sailing expedition  from Goa to Port Blair and back in double handed mode. Further, the duo successfully undertook a sortie from Goa to Port Louis, Mauritius again in dual handed mode early this year. Sagar Parikrama would be a grueling voyage requiring extreme skills, physical fitness and mental alertness. The officers have been training rigorously and gained thousands of miles of experience under their belt. They are also being trained under the mentorship of ace circumnavigator, and Golden Globe Race hero, Cdr Abhilash Tomy (Retd), KC, NM. The circumnavigation of INSV Tarini will be a significant step forward in India's ocean sailing enterprise and maritime endeavours, showcasing the nation's growing prominence in global maritime activities and  gender equality  on the high seas. Signifying the importance of this historic event in the maritime calendar, Indian Navy proudly unveils the Logo of the expedition . The octagonal shape in the centre depicts the Indian Navy, while the sun signifies a celestial body and the compass, guiding the sailors through the challenging seas.  The sail boat making its way through vastness of the ocean symbolises the spirit of adventure and resilience of the voyagers. The all women crew of the expedition is the testament to the Indian Navy's commitment to fostering gender equality and excellence."
127,Church calls for change in mentality to empower girls,"The  Church in Goa  has appealed for a change in mentality to empower the girl child in the latest issue of its pastoral bulletin, âRenovacaoâ which is focussed on the girl child. The  Archdiocese of Goa and Daman , in its bulletin urged all parents, brothers, and sisters to accept a girl child from birth âas an equal partner in the familyâ. âWhether in nourishment, or in education, or in socialisation, the girl child has to be treated as a human person with a different gender. Hence, in the family and every strata of society, we need to walk with the girl child treating her with  gender sensitivity ,â stated Fr Aleixo Menezes, editor of the magazine in the editorial âSynodality with the Girl Child.â âThe person and the personality of the girl child wishes that she is not treated as a dumb ox but a human person, who has a brain to think, a voice to speak, and decide what she wants. Hence, we have to walk with the girl child with open eyes, open ears, assisting hands, and a respectful attitude,â the editorial stated. In Goa, where the literacy rate is 88%, women are still considered inferior to men, the editorial stated, adding that although the custom of giving dowry is technically forbidden by law, the âdotâ/ âdennemâ tradition still continues, whereby the bride is made to feel that she is being handed over to her husband with bag and baggage. âBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme was launched by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi in 2015 seems to be a piece for archives. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act seems to be a toothless tiger. The Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act 2003, has not been able to control/prohibit the falling female child sex ratio. The Prohibition of  Child Marriage Act  has not reached rural Indiaâ âStatistics speak for themselves: India is still plagued by the malice of girl foeticide,â the editorial states. It also states that even among the Catholic community, many prefer the firstborn to be a boy or at least one boy child. âThere are/will be multiple numbers of laws to respect, protect, and defend the rights and dignity of a girl/woman. Let us not treat girl child and woman as baby dolls to be played with and discarded after use,â the editorial stated."

129,90-day special sanitation drive in Guntur,"Guntur: Taking a leaf out of the devastation caused by the recent  floods in Vijayawada ,  Guntur municipal corporation  (GMC) has taken up a 90-day special sanitation drive in the city. The drive is aimed at clearing all the open drains, ensure free flow of storm water and keep the city garbage free. GMC commissioner  Puli Srinivasulu , who oversaw the relief and rescue operations in some areas of Vijayawada during the recent floods, has resolved that Guntur should not face such a threat. He designed the special sanitation drive with an aim to resolve several issues he came across during the relief operations in Vijayawada.  ""We can save any city from floods and inundation only with the active participation of public. We have set a target to make Guntur city the cleanest and safe city in the state,"" Srinivasulu told TOI. He appointed 22 special officers to closely monitor the drive in 22 sanitation divisions. All sanitation workers and senior officials were directed to be in the streets by 5:30am. ""There is no exception to anyone for three months. From senior officials to workers, everyone must be in the field by 5:30am. I will also be there to monitor the work,"" said Srinivasulu.  The special officers have been directed to supervise water supply and quality of water. They must identify encroachments on drains and take measures for their removal."
130,A lifetime in muck - for a few bucks more,"NEW DELHI: By day, Anil toils in the dingy confines of a  public washroom  in west Delhi, scrubbing away the grime of countless strangers. At night, with the city agleam in light, the 35-year-old descends into darkness - literally and figuratively - to clean sewers, braving the treacherous turns and  toxic fumes .  His story is mirrored in the lives of hundreds of others trapped in a struggle for survival. They juggle multiple jobs, their days a blur of  backbreaking labour , their hope, a few extra rupees at the end of the day. Behind the grimy facade of the public washroom, a clandestine network thrives. Anil and his fellow  sanitation workers  converge to snag the ""off-the-books"" jobs. They seize the fleeting chances to have some extra earnings to send home, often as lifelines to loved ones awaiting sustenance. Each successful sewer-cleaning stint earns them Rs 1,500-2,000. But these workers share a bond of tragedy, having lost many family and friends to toxic sewer gases. The deaths are ironic since the compensation pay-out brings monetary solace to grieving families. When TOI spoke to these workers, their stories were of unimaginable adversities. Anil, for example, lost his mother to an illness when he was merely 12 and this family tragedy compelled him to shoulder responsibilities far surpassing his years. He was forced to abandon his schooling after Class VIII and to undertake various menial jobs in his village in Haryana. All his adolescent dreams of a comfortable urban life rapidly disintegrated to expose him to a fraught existence. After his marriage, Anil relocated to Delhi, where he initially grappled with securing stable employment and toiled as a labourer. It was during this period that his father-in-law, who was engaged in  manual scavenging , exposed him to the grimness of cleaning gutters and sewers in the metropolis. Anil recalls his mother's agony and the financial hardships his family endured, remembering the profound regret etched in his father's eyes - an emotion he ardently strives to shield his own children from experiencing. Regardless of how arduous or perilous the work may be, he willingly descends into the sewer lines to provide for his family, resolute that they should never endure the hunger he faced as a child. On most days, Anil can be found at the public toilet in JJ Colony, Raghubir Nagar, where he has been allocated a small room to share with his family. He harbours dreams of securing a superior job - one that commands respect, offers a dependable income and lessens the incessant worry of whether he will return home unscathed each day. In a shack on Nala Road in the same locality lives Gangaram, a 67-year-old man. After years of toiling as a labourer and being coerced into cleaning gutters and sewers by thekedars, his contractors, he began developing severe health problems and was ultimately diagnosed with tuberculosis. ""I lost my govt identity cards,"" lamented Gangaram. ""I had to move from Noida to Raghubir Nagar after my illness. I'm unfit to perform any physical labour now and have to beg on the roads to have enough to feed myself."" There's a sense of defeat in his voice when he adds, ""With whatever money I got when I worked, I had to buy medicines for myself. But even that has ceased now."" Asked about manual scavenging and  sewer cleaning , Gangaram's response was, ""When I was younger, I was willing to undertake any work to earn something for that day. I was born in a jhuggi in Dhaula Kuan and will die in a jhuggi here in Raghubir Nagar. What choice did I have from the beginning of my life?"" Gangaram earns a little bit these days acting as a middle-man, connecting those wanting to have their blocked sewers, drains and gutters cleaned with those who are desperate for some money for sustenance.. People who hire such cleaners range from contractors to residents' welfare associations, sometimes homeowners with dysfunctional pipelines and gutters. Anil disclosed that if someone wanted their sewers cleaned, word was informally spread and almost any day the hirers would find the person to do their work. The payment rates are not fixed. For whatever sum they are offered, these labourers enter danger zones without safety gear whatsoever, not even masks. Most of the able-bodied labourers in the locality, according to Om Prakash, a 40-year-old caretake of a public toilet, are anyway compelled to do sewer cleaning work by their contractors. These contractors, the sub-surface workers confided, threaten to withhold payment for work if they refuse to go down into the sewers and drains. Om Prakash said that he had also worked in this fashion for more than two decades of his life. He said, ""It's not that the foul smell of the sewers doesn't bother me, but because I am anyway responsible for cleaning toilets in an overpopulated jhuggi habitation with little to no help, barely functioning water pipelines and broken infrastructure, I'm resigned to my circumstances. So, cleaning sewers only means I will have some extra rupees in my pocket."" Next: Matchstick, survival and the desperate need to make some money"
131,Comprehensive probe into the spread of diarrhoea in Gurla,"VIZIANAGARAM: The special chief secretary rank officer and senior IAS officer K. Vijayanand, appointed by the state govt as the inquiry officer, visited the district on Tuesday to investigate the  diarrhoea outbreak  in the  Gurla  mandal centre, which led to several deaths. He met with district collector Dr BR Ambedkar and other concerned district officials, including those from the Panchayat Raj, Rural Water Supply, and Medical and Health departments, to gather comprehensive information on the causes of  water contamination ,  sanitation conditions  in the village, and  medical assistance  provided to diarrhoea victims. He specifically inquired about the actions taken by all these departments' staff immediately after the incident. He also learned about diarrhoea cases recorded in nearby villages before the outbreak in Gurla. He investigated the response of the Medical Health Department to the outbreak and the medical assistance provided and gathered details on when the first case was reported in Gurla. Lab tests on  drinking water quality  revealed the presence of bacteria responsible for the diarrhoea outbreak. The Special Chief Secretary also inquired about the causes of drinking water contamination in the village. He examined the lab report results following water tests. He checked whether overhead tanks were regularly chlorinated. He questioned Rural Water Supply SE Umashankar about the possibility of contamination in water supplied by the SSR Peta drinking water scheme. He noted that water could be contaminated due to leaks in drinking water pipelines and suggested the immediate replacement of pipelines in drains. He asked how often overhead tanks were cleaned and the stage at which drinking water became contaminated. He learned that  open defecation  was occurring in the village and inquired about the number of families without individual toilets. District Panchayat Officer Venkateswara Rao reported that 180 out of 918 families lacked toilets, and some families with toilets used them for other purposes. He inquired whether the constructed toilets in the village were built with proper design. He also gathered details of sanitation management in the village. He mentioned that raising public awareness, regular chlorination of drinking water sources, changing people's habits, and promoting personal hygiene could prevent the spread of diarrhoea. He visited the Gurla village and inspected the drinking water scheme at SSR Pet in Nellimarla mandal. He also visited the Gurla Primary Health Centre, spoke with patients receiving treatment for diarrhoea, and inquired about medical care."
132,Swachh Bharat campaign becoming new path to prosperity: PM Modi,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday hailed the   as the largest and most successful people's movement of the 21st century, emphasising its impact on  public health  and prosperity. Speaking at an event to mark 10 years of the mission, Modi said that mass participation had transformed the campaign into a new path to  prosperity  for India.  ""You all made the Swachh Bharat Mission a success,"" the prime minister said while noting that over 28 crore people took part in more than 27 lakh events organised in just 15 days during the 'Sewa Pakhwada'.  He said chief ministers, ministers, and other representatives played key roles in this national effort and underlined that ""continuous efforts can only lead to a  .""  During the event, the prime minister inaugurated projects worth around Rs 10,000 crore under the Swachh Bharat and AMRUT 2.0 missions, which include water and sewage treatment plants across several states.  ""When people talk about the 21st-century India even after 1,000 years, they will definitely remember the Swachh Bharat Mission,"" Modi said, emphasising the mission's lasting legacy.  The prime minister also criticised previous governments for neglecting basic  sanitation .  ""They never considered dirt and lack of toilets as national issues. It was like they made dirt a part of their lives,"" he said.  ""The first job of a prime minister is to make the lives of the common man easy. I talked about toilets and sanitary pads, and today, we see the results,"" he said.  The prime minister highlighted that more than 60 percent of the population was forced to defecate in the open a decade ago, which he called as an insult to Dalits, backward classes, and tribal communities, and a major source of inconvenience for women. Modi also cited studies and reports that underline the positive outcomes of the mission.  An international study has shown that the Swachh Bharat Mission is saving the lives of 60,000 to 70,000 children annually, while a  UNICEF  report indicates that over 90 percent of women feel safer due to construction of household toilets, he said.  Additionally, the   has credited the mission with saving 300,000 lives between 2014 and 2019 by reducing deaths from diarrhea, Modi added.  The prime minister also noted a shift in attitudes toward sanitation workers, stating that the Swachh Bharat Mission has brought them respect and pride.  ""Cleanliness is not just a one-day task but a lifelong value,"" he said, urging citizens to pass on the value of cleanliness from generation to generation and treat their surroundings with the same care as places of worship."
133,"Why Swachh Bharat is a Clean Mission, but a Dirty Job","The   promotes 'garbage-free cities', yet workers â predominantly from marginalised communities â continue to face hazardous, stigmatised labour. They manually sort unsanitary waste like nappies and menstrual products, often without adequate safety gear. The Swachh Bharat Mission Urban 2.0 guidelines promote door-to-door waste collection, urging residents to separate waste, including menstrual products wrapped in newspapers or bags for safe disposal. It aims to standardise disposal, collection, and transportation across urban areas. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) encourages residents to segregate sanitary waste before disposal, integrating this practice into a broader framework for sustainable  waste management . However, the implementation of these guidelines often places undue pressure on  sanitation workers . In Chennai, waste collection in 12 of the GCC's 15 zones is managed by private operators Urbaser Sumeet and Chennai Enviro Solutions Limited, with further privatisation planned. Supervisors within the GCC and private companies further impose tonnage-based waste collection targets on sanitation workers to achieve the performance goals stipulated in their contracts. For instance, in one of the zones managed by one of the operators, sanitation workers reported their supervisors mandate each worker to bring 5kg-7kg of sanitary pads and nappies daily, with similar targets set for other types of waste, including food waste and plastics. Sanitation workers play a key role in waste management, collecting garbage that should be segregated by households into wet, dry, and  hazardous waste . However, when the public fails to do so, workers must manually sort unsegregated waste on their battery-operated vehicles before transporting it to disposal sites. This hazardous, stigmatised labour often falls on workers from scheduled caste backgrounds. One worker described using her bare hands to collect sanitary waste: ""When I question the practice, I am told it is my job."" The GCC must urgently address these issues, starting by reviewing the collection targets imposed on sanitation workers. Target-based waste collection, especially under privatisation, focuses on outcomes in simple, quantified terms, ignoring the labour-intensive processes reliant on marginalised workers. Manually segregating waste to meet tonnage requirements is unsustainable, particularly as household-level segregation in Chennai is estimated to be as low as 25%. The safety and health of sanitation workers need urgent attention. Workers handle waste with inadequate protective gear. ""I get two cloth gloves a month but still get cuts from glass,"" says Suresh (name changed), a worker employed with a private operator. ""We need more sturdy gloves to protect us from toxins in wet waste."" Many buy extra gloves and masks to safeguard themselves and their families. The GCC and private operators must ensure all workers are equipped with proper, high-quality safety gear. The health of sanitation workers must be regularly monitored, with comprehensive preventive care provided. Many workers say they self-medicate with painkillers or alcohol to cope with the unsanitary conditions. A GCC supervisor reported several deaths among workers aged 38-45 due to alcohol overuse. Tuberculosis and asthma are common but often undiagnosed and untreated. Permanent GCC employees have limited health insurance, which covers emergencies but not regular check-ups, and this is at risk with privatisation. Informal workers, meanwhile, lack any health insurance, and none receive adequate preventive care for occupational diseases. The GCC provides one annual vaccine for Tetanus Toxoid (TT) and Hepatitis B. However, a corporation doctor noted that it maintains no health record of the diseases or the treatment received at the urban primary health centres. ""Sanitation workers need health cards and regular health camps to monitor and prevent diseases such as TB and asthma,"" says R Geetha, advisor to the Unorganised Workers Federation. Workers also regularly raise concerns about the lack of water, toilets, and changing facilities at work, along with pay discrepancies and limited pension access. The GCC needs to also ensure consistent waste segregation at source across the city. Segregated waste collection varies, with some neighbourhoods relying on street bins rather than door-to-door collection. The GCC needs to explain to the public why these discrepancies exist. There is also no signage for sanitary waste like nappies and menstrual products at common disposal sites such as bins on vehicles, street bins, or public toilets. While the GCC has been creating awareness on segregating sanitary waste through their information, education & communication (IEC) activities, the lack of signage puts an added burden on the sanitation worker to request menstrual waste at the door-to-door collection or manually sort through the street garbage bins for sanitary waste. The GCC and private operators must clearly communicate this burden to the public. Effective communication through IEC activities will help inform the public about sanitation workers' specific waste collection schedules. Workers have notebooks with detailed maps and schedules. Public awareness can help coordinate segregated waste collection. ""We need more awareness on waste segregation,"" says Suresh. ""Otherwise, supervisors blame us for the public's ignorance."" **Piling Up** - GCC claims to collect 6,150 metric tonnes of waste every day. - Chennai city generates 0.71kg of solid waste per day per capita, the highest per capita amount of waste generated in India according to a 2022 Chennai Circularity Assessment Protocol report. - According to a 2021 govt report, 68% of Chennai's solid waste is generated by residents, 18% by commercial enterprises, 14% by institutions and businesses, and the rest by construction and demolitions.

134,"âFront runnerâ in clean water and sanitation, lags in gender equality","Bhubaneswar:   has emerged as a âfront runnerâ state in providing  clean water  and  sanitation , which corresponds to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, attaining the highest score of 88, according to the  SDG India Index  2023-24 released by NITI Aaayog recently. On the other hand, it received the lowest score of 39 in ensuring  gender equality  (SDG 5), being ranked an âaspirantâ state in the parameter.  The percentage of rural households with piped water connections in the state stands at 72.97, according to the report. The percentage of households with an improved source of drinking water in the state stands at an impressive 99.42. The state has also attained 100% coverage in number of toilets installed in households and districts declared open defecation-free. Srikant Tripathy, a former senior official in the rural development department, said the success in ensuring sanitation in rural areas is linked to the proper implementation of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). âUnder the central scheme, major milestones have been achieved,â he said. He said concentrated efforts were made in the villages, which cover more than 60% of the stateâs area. âPublic participation too made a difference in achieving success in proper water supply and sanitation,â he added. The report revealed the stateâs sex ratio stands at 894 per 1,000 males, falling short of the NITI Aayogâs target of 950. The national sex ratio stands at 929. Moreover, the ratio of wage or salary earnings of women to men is 0.59, while 30.3% of married women experience spousal violence, the report said. The ratio of female to male labour force participation is 0.58, and only 60% of women are satisfied with modern family planning methods, it said. There are 216 women per 1,000 men in managerial positions, while the percentage of women with land holdings is a meagre 4.06. Only 50% of women in the state possess mobile phones, the report revealed. Experts attributed the low score in SDG 5 to various factors, including a lack of awareness about initiatives designed for women and girls. Human rights activist Biswapriya Kanungo emphasised the need for the govt to popularise initiatives aimed at women empowerment. âState-specific schemes should be extensively launched for women and girls, particularly in rural areas. There are persistent gaps in education, employment and societal participation for women, which need to be addressed,â the activist said.  Swikruti Mishra, a student of Rama Devi Womenâs University, said there is a need to introduce specialised schemes for girls in education and startup sectors."
135,DDA finalises plan for upkeep of Jasola HIG flats,"New Delhi: After receiving an encouraging response for the flats offered in the three  housing schemes  launched in Jasola in Aug,  Delhi Development Authority  ( DDA ) has finalised a comprehensive plan for the maintenance and upkeep of civic services in various pockets, including 9A, 9B and 6, in phases. While DDA is still corresponding with Municipal Corporation of Delhi to take over the  sanitation services  in these pockets, it has decided to choose agencies to perform these tasks for a year for the convenience of the residents. The project includes the maintenance of 320 high-income group (HIG) multistoryed flats in Pocket-9A by desilting internal sewer lines using super-sucker machines, in addition to cleaning drains. DDA will also assign tasks for day-to-day cleaning, sweeping, and cleaning of internal roads and common areas at Jasola Heights.  An agency will be in charge of the day-to-day maintenance and attend to the complaints related to external and internal services at DDA HIG flats in Pocket-9B for a year. The repair and maintenance of the local shopping centre and a community hall in Pocket 6 are part of the comprehensive project. ""There have been regular complaints from residents regarding the lack of proper cleaning of internal lanes in their flat areas, and we aim to resolve all sanitation issues and make this place a perfect place to live,"" said an official.  In Aug, DDA conducted a survey of the area and decided to completely overhaul the roads, drains and footpaths in Jasola. The authority has finalised a separate proposal for the repair of roads and constructing missing drains and footpaths at District Centre Jasola and in Pocket I and II, with an estimated cost of Rs 3.3 crore.  ""The project will include repairing perennial waterlogging points, damaged roads and constructing missing drains to avoid water accumulation. We will re-invite tenders for the project soon,"" said an official. The project, which will also have another phase, was initiated after discussions with residents welfare associations and residents in the areas.  The open area behind the district centre, near the parking lot, faces the problem of waterlogging and the drain network and footpaths are also missing opposite the centre, the survey stated. The project also aims to provide pedestrian walkways throughout the colony. ""On Church Road, connecting to Jasola Village Road, DDA made concrete stretches around nine years ago. But due to the movement of heavy vehicles and trucks to the sewage treatment plant, it has been damaged in many places, and there has been a long-standing demand to repair it properly,"" an official said. DDA will also reconstruct damaged drains before the road repair till Jasola Sports Complex Road, he added. "
136,MCG takes pvt firmâs help to clear Swachh test,"Gurgaon: After finishing 140th out of 446 cities in the  Swachh Survekshan  rankings released in Jan this yearâits worst performance since the rankings were introduced by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in 2016âthe   is gearing up for the next survey with a series of initiatives. On Tuesday, a special orientation workshop was held at the municipal office to provide detailed information and training for Swachh Survekshan, one of the largest  urban sanitation  and cleanliness surveys.  To raise awareness about source segregation and waste minimisation, the MCG has hired a private agency. Planned initiatives include zero waste events, water plus initiatives, source segregation, interpersonal communication, waste-to-wealth activities, clean ward competitions, and self-reliant wards. Rakesh Bhatt, an expert from the agency, said his team will provide technical assistance to the MCG, including data collection, fieldwork, document preparation, and information, education, and communication (IEC) activities. ""The agency will focus on educating the public and promoting best practices in  waste management  to reduce overall waste generation in the city. This time, the corporation will ensure maximum citizen participation as part of a public movement,"" Bhatt added. Under Swachh Survekshan, the MCG has identified 9,500 points in Gurgaon, divided into three categories: 5,705 points for service level progress, 2,500 points for certification, and 1,295 points for public movement activities. ""Service level progress includes segregated waste collection, waste processing and disposal, and used water management,"" said an MCG official. Explaining how cities are classified based on population brackets, the official said last year, Gurgaon was placed in the over 1 lakh population category and ranked 19th among 382 cities surveyed. This year, it falls into the 1-10 lakh population bracket.  ""The city lagged in source segregation and waste processing, this year,"" the official added."
137,War-torn Gaza faces rising child health threats: Hepatitis and skin diseases surge amid water crisis,"In  Gaza , a region devastated by conflict, numerous young children are suffering from serious medical conditions, including   and various skin ailments. These  health problems  are primarily attributed to the  scarcity  of  clean water  suitable for drinking and bathing purposes. The dire situation has left many children vulnerable to preventable illnesses, as the lack of access to safe water sources continues to pose a significant threat to their well-being. The ongoing war has severely impacted the region's infrastructure, making it difficult for families to obtain the clean water necessary for maintaining proper hygiene and health. Gaza's  water infrastructure , including desalination plants and water wells, has been severely damaged since the war with Israel. According to NBC News,  Oxfam International  reported that all desalination plants and 88% of water wells have been destroyed or damaged, along with all wastewater treatment plants and 70% of sewage pumps.  As a result, the available water in Gaza has dropped by 94%, leaving residents with less than 5 litres per person daily. Humanitarian organisations  are working to repair infrastructure, install septic tanks, and distribute clean water and chlorine tablets, but their access to the area is limited.  Residents are forced to consume and bathe in untreated seawater contaminated with sewage, without access to soap or disinfectants. This has led to a significant increase in cases of hepatitis A, acute respiratory infections, acute diarrhoea, jaundice, skin rashes, and scabies. The United Nations has reported efforts to restore electricity to a desalination plant in southern Gaza, which could provide clean water to approximately one million people.  However, the health threats associated with contaminated water continue to escalate, with the  polio virus  being detected in wastewater samples in June.  Although no new cases have been confirmed, the World Health Organization warns of a high risk of polio spreading in Gaza, as the virus can be transmitted through drinking water contaminated with faeces from an infected person. According to health officials, skin diseases are spreading rapidly in Gaza. They attribute this to the deplorable conditions in overcrowded tent camps housing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians, along with the summer heat and the breakdown of sanitation, resulting in pools of open sewage amid Israel's 10-month bombardment and offensives in the territory. The World Health Organization reports that doctors are dealing with over 103,000 cases of lice and scabies and 65,000 cases of skin rashes. The United Nations Development Program says that among Gaza's population of approximately 2.3 million, more than 1 million cases of acute respiratory infections, over half a million cases of acute diarrhea, and more than 100,000 cases of jaundice have been recorded since the war began. Palestinians say that maintaining cleanliness is impossible in the makeshift tents, which are essentially wood frames covered with blankets or plastic sheets, packed closely together over large areas. Over 1.8 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been forced from their homes, often relocating multiple times in the past months to escape Israeli ground assaults or bombardment. The majority are now crowded into a 50-square-kilometre area of dunes and fields on the coast with virtually no sewage system and limited water. UN officials report that the distribution of humanitarian supplies, including soap, shampoo, and medicines, has slowed to a trickle because Israeli military operations and general lawlessness in Gaza make it too dangerous for relief trucks to move. ""Israel launched its campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its October 7 attack on southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 350 abducted. Israel's assault has killed more than 39,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities."""
138,"60 more mechanical sweepers needed for road cleaning, CAQM told","New Delhi:   (MCD) requires at least 112 mechanical road sweepers â 60 more than it has currently â to ensure the effective cleaning of 6,730km of roads for  dust mitigation , the civic body said in its report submitted to  CAQM  on Monday. ""MCD has 52 mechanical road sweepers. With each machine capable of covering a 30-35 km area per day, we are able to cover 1,700km of roads and collect 150 MT of waste. Running short of its requirement, MCD is enhancing the frequency of 52 machines to meet the requirement as per GRAP norms,"" said an official. ""But to ensure city roads more than 60 feet wide are covered efficiently, we need better infrastructure and more machinery. The process for procuring 18 machines has been hindered due to lack of permission from the standing committee for inviting a new agency,"" said the official. On the requirement for the remaining 42 sweeping machines, MCD stressed on adequate funding. ""The matter was discussed in a recent meeting. It was stated that the demand should be shared with Centre as these  mechanical sweepers  are important to clean roads. Right now, we are sweeping with machines alternate days. If cleaning starts on a daily basis, we will need 250 machines. This was calculated after taking into account that some machines may become non-functional due to glitches,"" said the official. For sweeping of internal roads (12 feet wide) that cover 15,582km, MCD has deputed 57,000 sanitation workers. ""They have been asked to wear protective gear to save themselves from dust pollution and sweep twice a day in commercial areas and markets. They collect 8-12 MT of waste per day,"" he added. MCD has also deployed 225 water sprinklers, including 28 mobile machines. ""Of these, 130 are deployed daily and cover 1,400km. We are using treated water for sprinkling,"" said the official. The civic body has also deployed anti-smog guns at 20 sites, including waste-to-energy plants, dumpsites and C&D waste processing units. Moreover, 15 static anti-smog machines are installed at highrises and another 32 at major construction sites. The CAQM advisory has directed executive engineers to incorporate the special terms and conditions in tender documents. For example, all vehicles carrying construction material should be fully covered, and debris must be stored at the site, not dumped on roads, footpaths or in the open. ""Unpaved surfaces and areas with loose soil shall be adequately sprinkled with water to suppress dust. All C&D waste shall be recycled or transported to an authorised recycling facility,"" MCD said.

139,Pakistan: Lahore records heaviest rainfall in years,"A record amount of rain fell on  's second city of  Lahore  on Thursday,  flooding  houses and hospitals. Some areas of the city, which is close to the border with neighboring India, saw 353 millimeters (14 inches) in a matter of hours, the  water and sanitation agency  said. That broke a previous record of 332 millimeters over three hours in the city in July 1980, according to authorities. Pakistan Meteorological Department 's (PMD) deputy director, Farooq Dar, described the deluge as ""record-breaking  rainfall "" in the region, according to AFP news agency. Schools and offices remain closed in Lahore At least one person is reported to have died in Lahore after being electrocuted. The city's commissioner has declared a state of emergency in the city, keeping all schools and offices closed for the day. The heavy downpour quickly flooded many streets and rainwater entered some wards in the Jinnah and Services hospitals in Lahore, causing problems for patients undergoing treatment there. An official in Lahore said the government had dedicated all resources to make sure clean-up operations were underway at the hospital and in the city. Elsewhere, the mountainous northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa also saw heavy rainfall the last three days. At least 24 people have died there, according to the provincial disaster management authority. Heavy rainfall is common in the region in the monsoon season between June and September in Pakistan. But the country, especially the south and the north of the country, faced catastrophic rainfall in 2022, with scientists linking the extreme weather event to climate change, or a long-term shift in weather patterns."
140,AAP demands raise in school sanitation allowance,"Surat: Elected councillors and workers of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held a protest at a school run by the  municipal school board  (MSB) of the  Surat Municipal Corporation  (SMC) in the  Lakshman Nagar  neighbourhood of Kapodra on Tuesday, demanding a higher sanitation allowance for each school.  AAP  members said a minimum of Rs 1,300 to a maximum of Rs 3,800 is paid as sanitation allowance per school per month.  ""The allowance paid to schools is too little and it is difficult for any school to get work done for that amount of money. Schools are paid the allowance based on their number of students,"" said Rakesh Hirpara, a member of the MSB.  AAP had demanded an increase in this allowance earlier as well. As the matter remained unresolved, party workers resorted to the demonstration. At the Lakshman Nagar school, 20-odd AAP workers cleaned the school lobby, passage and ground. The passages were washed using water.  ""School No. 98, where we held the protest, gets only Rs 1,400 as its monthly sanitation allowance. Due to this, the school campus, building and toilets are filthy on most days,"" said Hirpara.  AAP workers got complaints from several teachers about how they must do the cleaning on their own. ""We were told by teachers and principals many times that instead of working in a dirty school campus, they do the cleaning on their own. We have been demanding an increase in the allowance, but the municipal authorities are not resolving the issue,"" said Payal Sakariya, leader of the opposition in the SMC.  At a few schools, there are peons who do the cleaning work on a few days, while for the cleaning of toilets, school officials must hire workers.  ""The shortage of teachers is not the only issue at municipal schools. Students are even deprived of the basic need for a healthy study environment,"" added Sakariya. "
141,"PCB directs industries, hotel to switch from coal to clean fuel","Indore: In an effort to monitor and maintain the  air quality  in  Indore , one of the non-attainment cities, prior to the onset of the winter season, the  Pollution Control Board  (PCB) has directed industries, hotels, and restaurants that utilize coal to transition to cleaner fuel sources. The PCB has implemented a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to ensure optimal air quality in the city in the forthcoming weeks. SN Dwivedi, the regional officer of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board in Indore, said, ""We are monitoring activities that could potentially harm the environment and deteriorate air quality. Industrial units, hotels, and food establishments that rely on coal have been instructed to adopt cleaner fuel alternatives. We have also collaborated with the Indore Municipal Corporation to coordinate our efforts."" The regional Pollution Control Board has communicated with the Indore Municipal Corporation, requesting the formation of a team of officials in each zone to take action against individuals who engage in open garbage burning. ""We have also issued a public appeal, urging citizens to adhere to best practices and refrain from polluting the air by burning waste in the open. Open waste burning significantly pollutes the air and emits harmful gases that have detrimental effects on human health. The hazardous pollutants released from waste burning affect everyone, particularly the elderly and children,"" Dwivedi said. Furthermore, the PCB has directed the civic body to educate sanitation workers about the harmful consequences of open waste burning and its impact on air pollution. The board has also instructed the authorities to sprinkle water on roads and raise public awareness about air pollution. From April to September, the average Air Quality Index (AQI) in Indore city has ranged between 86 and 55. However, in the last 15 days of October, the average  AQI  has reached 87. AQI values between 0-50 indicate good air quality, while levels between 51-100 are considered satisfactory. AQI values between 101 to 200 are moderate, and above 200 falls into the poor category. Indore and Dewas are among the 122 non-attainment cities in the country, selected based on the air quality index and set parameters. "
142,8.5% water samples in Belagavi Rural areas deemed unfit for drinking,"Belagavi: Around 8.5% of water samples from rural areas in Belagavi District were found unfit for drinking, according to the drinking water and sanitation department. Out of 36,372 water samples tested across various labs and Water Quality Field Testing Kits (WQFTK), 3,013 samples were reported unfit. The alarming results have prompted further scrutiny and action. Every year, the  rural drinking water  and sanitation department conducts tests for water used for drinking at the gram panchayat level. There are five labs in Belagavi district for testing water. Accordingly, this year too, a total of 15,000 water samples were collected from the water bodies that people depended on for drinking from more than 500 village panchayats of Belagavi district. Out of this, 8,056 samples were collected and tested for water purity and safety, in collaboration with the health department. A total of 668 samples, including 63 samples in Belagavi, 136 in Chikodi, 222 in Savadatti, 220 in Athani, and 27 in Gokak, were found to be impure. Through WQFTK kits, one can measure various chemical constituents of the water sample in the field. Commonly, these samples are analysed in laboratories. On the other hand, a total of 28,316 samples of the district were tested through WQFTK kits by the local GP staff, out of which 25,971 samples were found to be potable and 2,345 samples were found to be non-potable. According to the officials of the rural drinking water and sanitation department, each water sample is tested on a total of 10 parameters, including fluoride, nitrate, chloride, and iron content, to ensure quality. High levels of calcium, magnesium, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, and fluoride in water can cause serious adverse health effects. Therefore, if there is a variation in these limits in the test report, such water is considered impure and non-potable. Due to the risk of contracting diseases like dysentery and cholera by drinking this water, steps have been taken to supply water from alternative sources to the people of this region. A ZP official said that as part of the campaign, samples of drinking water used for cooking and cleaning in schools were tested. Strict instructions have been given to the heads of the respective schools not to use impure water. There are many reasons for water to lose its purity, including climate change, filtration of sewage including drains, and soil quality in pipeline water. ZP CEO Rahul Shinde stated that it is instructed that unfit sources of water should not be used for any reason. Arrangements have been made to supply water from alternative sources with quality water. After a few days, the water sample will be tested again, and action will be taken based on the report."
143,Goa stays 4th in Nitiâs sustainable goals index,": While Goa improved its composite score by five points to 77, the state remained in its fourth position in  âs sustainable development goals (SDG) index for 2023-24. While the state managed to meet most SDG targets, it has been woefully inadequate in reducing   and minimising waste, the report said. Goa remains just two points shy of the top post, bagged by Uttarakhand with 79 points out of 100. NITI Aayog has categorised Goa as a frontrunner in achievement of the  sustainable goals , the same tag that the state bagged in the previous 2020-21 edition, when Goa stood fourth with 72 points. The  SDG index  ranks the  performance  of states based on achievements in 16 goals. States are given a goal-wise score for progress made in each parameter and are classified as achiever, frontrunner, performer, and aspirant, with this being the lowest rung. A state can bag the achiever status only after meeting 100% of the targets set in each of the 16 goals. According to NITI Aayogâs SDG India index 2023-24 report, Goaâs strong point remains access to  clean water  and sanitation. However, the stateâs low score in promoting green economy and sustainable infrastructure played a role in preventing the state from breaking into the top three ranks. Goa is the top performer among states and the only one to achieve 100% towards the SDG 6, clean water and sanitation. Two states â Tamil Nadu and Goa â achieved the national target of 100% access to basic infrastructure (electricity and drinking water). When it comes to SDG 12, which focuses on promoting resource efficiency, green economies, and sustainable infrastructure, Goa has the lowest score among states, with a score of 47. One of the reasons for Goaâs poor showing in SDG 12 is the fact that Goa generated the highest waste with 18.9 tonnes of plastic per annum, followed by Telangana which generated 12.6 tonnes per annum, per 1,000 population. Goa also consumed the most fuel of 526kg per capita. For Goa to improve its score, the state needs to halve its per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030, and reduce food wastage. Plastic waste generation and fossil fuel consumption also need to be drastically reduced, the report suggests. The NITI Aayog report has also recommended that Goa, which has only 3.5% of its area under aquaculture, needs to focus on aquaculture development along its coastline."
144,Waterborne disease cases spiked after flood in Vadodara,"VADODARA: The flood here last month seems to have left behind disease after the water receded. Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) teams have been pressed into action to ensure timely  medical aid  is available to citizens of affected areas.  With nearly a quarter of the city under floodwater, sanitation and the risk of an outbreak had become a major concern. Cleaning of affected areas was prioritized and home minister  Harsh Sanghavi , who is also the minister in charge of Vadodara, visited the affected areas when they were being cleaned.  Cases of  waterborne diseases  - particularly  acute diarrhoeal disease  (ADD) - have been rising consistently.  In the aftermath of the flood, these numbers rose by more than three times on certain days, compared to before the flood. Between Aug 21 and 27, this number was between 43 and 70 cases. After the flood, the numbers rose to as high as 194 on a single day, Sep 2. Till Sep 10, the daily number of ADD cases remained over 101.  VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said all efforts were made to ensure there was no major outbreak. ""The high number is also because our teams actively went on surveys in these areas and camped there to ensure all sick people got treatment and that preventive measures were in place,"" he said.  Patel added that the number of cases is also higher because more cases were being identified and enumerated by VMC teams. ""Earlier, such patients may have never approached a doctor and hence were not part of the data,"" Patel added. The numbers have started going down again significantly since last week.  Sources said the increase was expected as water gets contaminated and living conditions are unsanitary in the immediate aftermath of floods. ""Floodwater has sewage and other contaminants in it, which causes this situation,"" an official said. "
145,Clean-up begins at Cutbona after cholera outbreak,"The  Cutbona jetty , a crucial hub for the fishing industry in South Goa, has been undergoing a much-needed  clean-up  and sanitisation process since Tuesday.  The clean-up comes on the heels of a visit by the environment minister,  Aleixo Sequeira , who toured the jetty with senior officials from the district administration on Monday. Sequeira said he was satisfied with the progress in improving conditions at the jetty. Asphalting work near the old jetty and repair works to illuminate the jetty have been successfully completed. The minister also announced that the installation of a new water supply line is nearing completion, which will provide the jetty with a dedicated water supply pipeline by the public works department (PWD).  Currently, water is being supplied to the jetty through tankers. The recent  cholera outbreak  at Cutbona jetty has been a cause for concern, as it claimed several lives and led to the hospitalisation of numerous workers employed on fishing trawlers. The incident underscored the importance of maintaining proper sanitation and hygiene standards at the jetty to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Official sources said that by addressing the issues of infrastructure, water supply, and sanitation, the state aims to create a safer and more conducive environment for the fishing industry.âOur endeavour is to set a high standard for hygiene, sanitation, and overall working conditions,â a senior official said. "
146,"Vijayawada floods: Retaining wall to prevent flooding from Budameru on cards, says Andhra Pradesh minister P Narayana","VIJAYAWADA:  Municipal administration  and  urban development  minister Dr P Narayana has said that the state govt is contemplating taking up the construction of a  retaining wall  to protect  residential areas  in the city from future floods. He mentioned that chief minister  Chandrababu Naidu  had already directed the water resources department to increase the height of  Budameru  bunds to prevent additional flooding. Narayana, along with MSME minister  Kondapalli Srinivas , visited the flood-hit areas in the city on Sunday and enquired with the locals about the sanitation and  relief measures . He assured the locals of extending the fullest possible support to the residents until they fully recovered from the situation. He said that there was no need for the locals to worry about colonies getting inundated once again due to the rains. âThere is no chance of flooding into the city once again. The arrest of Budameru breaches stopped flood flow into the city and the increase of the bund height will completely prevent the floods into the city,â said Narayana. He stated that the encroachment of irrigation canals resulted in such massive damage to the city. He said that the supply of food and essentials would continue for a few more days as the people were struggling to come to terms with the situation. He assured that the govt would be with them until they completely recovered. He mentioned that essential commodities kits would also be supplied to each and every household. Additionally, they were supplying vegetables and drugs to the households. He said that chief minister Chandrababu Naidu directed them to supply food packets five times the actual number of victims to ensure that there is no shortage. He noted that the situation in some of the lanes in Singh Nagar, Old RR Pet, New RR Pet, Indira Nagar, and Payakapuram was still grim as water had yet to recede. He assured that flood water would completely recede by Monday. âWe will clean all the houses within 24 hours of the flood water receding in the colony. The fire services teams are working overtime to clean the colonies and houses,â said Narayana. He added that they would take up sanitation work, bleaching, and fogging soon after the cleaning of mud."
147,Southern Africa's cholera outbreak is a multinational fight,"In Brondo in the southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), accessing  clean water  is essential for survival. Despite enjoying rich rainfall for much of the year, the region lacks proper water treatment. For residents like Betty, access to  sanitation  and treated water therefore is extremely limited. ""We drink the unclean water. There are overflowing septic tanks and rainwater that brings the city's garbage into the houses,"" Betty told DW. Health experts have issued renewed warnings about surging cholera cases in the region. The disease is spreading rapidly in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and the DRC, with neighboring countries keeping a watchful eye on their borders. Yet most longterm remedies against the outbreak are to be found at the local level. In Zimbabwe, the situation has reached a critical point. Since the beginning of the outbreak, more than 22,000 cases and over 450 deaths have been repoted. Doctors have criticized a lack of awareness about preventive measures among communities. ""People are not keen on treating borehole water,"" Michael Vere, an epidemiologist at Harare Central Hospital, said in reference to water extracted through narrow shafts bored into the ground. ""They assume that borehole water is safe, but the water is not safe.""  In Zimbabwe's capital, the issue is further exacerbated by the population density in certain areas, such as the Highfield suburb. Communities are now facing a shortage of safe playing areas for children, as raw sewage continues to flow in backyards and on the streets. Chiedza Zulu, a concerned mother of four, summarized the fear that has been gripping the community. ""Cholera cases are cropping up around us. We now keep oral hydration salts in case we contract the disease. Sewage is flowing, and refuse is not being collected. Flies, rodents, and mosquitos are plenty here. This is unbearable,"" she told DW. Vere emphasized the importance of addressing inadequate water and sanitation conditions to protect local residents. ""We encourage people to treat all water, regardless of source,"" he said. With suspected and confirmed cases reported in 61 out of 64 districts, Zimbabwe's government has now taken action to address the outbreak head-on. Health authorities have set up 153 cholera treatment centers and have initiated a cholera vaccination campaign. However, a global shortage of the cholera vaccine has been hampering Zimbabwe's efforts to vaccinate a large portion of its population. Douglas Mombeshora, Zimbabwe's Health and Child Minister, said the vaccine was not a quick fix for ending the cholera crisis. ""The vaccine is not an end to cholera,"" Mombeshora told reporters. He added that it rather amounted to ""a temporary response which should be complemented with tangible investment in safe water provision."" According to a UNICEF report, Zimbabwe is facing a shortage of investment in water and sanitation infrastructure. As a result, only about one in three households have access to treated water sources and sanitation. Mozambique appears to be in a similar situation as Zimbabwe, with around 40,000 cholera cases and 151 resulting fatalities reported so far. However, Mozambique's numbers reach as far back as September 2022, marking a slow march towards endemic propotions. Similarly, the DRC is also currently grappling with a longer-lasting  cholera outbreak . Despite ongoing efforts to strengthen disease surveillance and response activities, there have been nearly 300 cholera cases recorded in the DRC's southeastern Haut-Katanga province since the beginning of the year. Albert Tambwe, director of the School of Public Health at the University of Lubumbashi, attributes the rise in cases to overall unsanitary conditions. ""The conclusion is that our water is indeed 52% contaminated, but with salmonella and other germs,"" he said, highlighting the daily struggle people face whenever they turn on their taps. Tambwe, however, added that there wasn't any notable rate of cholera bacteria in the water â yet. Meanwhile in neighboring Malawi, there have only been 58 cholera cases reported so far. However, health experts are calling on the government to nevertheless allocate more funds towards water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs, and not be appeased by lower case numbers compared to its neighbors. Maziko Matemba, a public health expert in Malawi, highighted the need to improve access to safe and clean water in a bid to curb the spread of the disease. ""If it is not well supported in terms of buying commodities and other necessities, I think it will be challenging,"" Matemba told DW. The Ministry of Health in Malawi has actively been monitoring the disease since the start of its national campaign to end cholera in 2023. Adrian Chikumbe, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, says the government has a comprehensive set of measures aimed at containing the spread in place, including intensified communication efforts and enhanced surveillance. Matemba believes this is not enought. He underscored the magnitude of the persistent cholera risk in Malawi, and cited factors like limited access to clean water and the urgent need for substantial support in terms of resources as solutions to a ""ticking time bomb."" Malawi's Minister of Water and Sanitation Abida Mia believes that it is not so much the quality of the water itself but rather its use that needs be highlighteed in campaigns. She believes that promoting better hygiene practices are key components of the ongoing efforts to combat the disease. ""Hygiene is the main problem that we are facing regarding the spread of cholera,"" she told DW. In response to the escalating health crisis, leaders of the intergovernmental organization the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have devised a collective strategy to combat cholera. They have pledged to increase investment in water and sanitation infrastructure in the region. ""The public health crisis plaguing our region poses a serious threat to sustainable development and the well-being of our peoples,"" said Angolan President Joao Loureco, who currently chairs the rotating presidency of SADC. ""Cholera knows no borders and requires a regional approach to address it,"" Loureco added. In a virtual summit, SADC leaders agreed to provide efficient waste management and a sustainable supply of clean water. They also recognized that at least 40 percent of the region's population lacked access to safe water."

The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against  climate change  through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.   With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.   Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as  clean energy  is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.   ""The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,"" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.   A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.   Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, ""This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.""   Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal's Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power."

158,India could be a green energy powerhouse,"In the race to combat climate change, India is emerging as a dark horse contender to become a global  green energy powerhouse . With ambitious targets, innovative technologies, and a diverse energy portfolio, the worldâs most populous country is positioning itself at the forefront of the  renewable energy revolution . As nations worldwide grapple with the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, Indiaâs multifaceted approach to green energy development is garnering attention. âIndia has set an ambitious net zero goal to achieve by 2070,â says Sanjukta Subudhi, associate director of microbial  biofuels  and biochemicals at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). As Sanjukta puts it, all forms of green energy molecules  solar , bio-based, hydrothermal, and other biomolecules are seen to play a key role in achieving this net zero goal. One of the cornerstones of Indiaâs green energy strategy is its push for biofuels, an energy source that gets far too little attention. The country has rolled out several programs, including the ethanol blending program and the SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme, aimed at increasing the production and use of biofuels. Sanjukta says India has set a target of achieving 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2030, which will cut down our dependence on costly and polluting fossil fuels. The development of biofuels in India goes beyond just ethanol. Researchers are exploring various sources of biomass, including agricultural waste, forest residues, and even coconut fibre, to produce a range of biofuels and valuable byproducts. Sanjay Kumar Kar, professor at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, says this diversified approach is the only way a country as large as India can effectively utilise its natural resources to cut oil imports. While biofuels represent a significant portion of Indiaâs green energy portfolio, solar and  wind power  are leading the charge in terms of installed capacity. According to Bragadesh Damodaran, VP and energy transition & utilities industry platform leader at Capgemini India, the countryâs installed renewable energy capacity has surpassed 180 gigawatts as of 2024. âIndia has set an ambitious target of achieving 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030, including 280 gigawatts from solar and 140 gigawatts from wind,â Bragadesh said. This massive expansion plan in renewable energy infrastructure is attracting substantial investments from both domestic and international sources. Perhaps the most exciting development in Indiaâs green energy landscape is its foray into green hydrogen production. The National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to pro duce at least 5 million metric tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030, with the potential to double that figure. âBy 2030, India will emerge as the worldâs largest producer and exporter of green hydrogen, revolutionising global energy markets and positioning itself as a central hub in the global transition to a low-carbon economy,â says Bragadesh. However, Sanjay also points out the challenges, particularly the troubling water-energy nexus. âWe require clean water for production of hydrogen, and that is a scarce resource in most parts of this country.â To address this issue, researchers are exploring a range of solutions, such as producing hydrogen from saline water. This could be a game-changer for coastal refineries that lack access to fresh-water resources."
159,Biden administration awards $20 billion for clean energy investment in low-income communities,"NORTH CAROLINA: Vice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Michael Regan on Thursday announced eight organizations that will oversee the spending of $20 billion in grants to fund tens of thousands of  clean energy  and  transportation projects  in disadvantaged communities across the United States.  ""While every community has the capacity to join the  clean energy economy , not every community has had the opportunity to do that,"" Harris said at an event on Charlotte announcing the grantees, adding that the funding reflects two  Biden administration  priorities - expanding access to capital and building a clean energy economy.  The $20 billion, made available through the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) created in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, will largely be invested in projects ranging from home energy retrofitting programs to off-grid renewable energy in communities that have not had access to green financing.  The selected organizations will create a national clean financing network that will help kickstart projects over the next seven years that are expected to reduce or avoid up to 40 million metric tons of climate pollution annually.  Harris and Regan visited a home in the historically black neighborhood of Grier Heights in Charlotte, North Carolina, where homeowner has used the type of financing that will be made available through the GRRF to retrofit his home heating and energy systems to make it more efficient and affordable.  A local nonprofit, Self-Help, that helped him access funding years ago to retrofit his home, co-leads one Climate United, one of the eight organizations selected to distribute federal funding to help replicate the types of retrofits that have been happening in Grier Heights.  The EPA plans to get the money to the organizations by September this year. The GGRF has been a target of congressional Republicans, who passed a resolution this year attempting to repeal what they have called a climate ""slush fund."" Three non-profit coalitions comprised of community development financial institutions, local green banks and other community lending organizations were chosen to distribute $14 billion from a National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), that aims to support affordable clean technology projects nationwide.  Another five groups have been chosen to administer the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which will provide funding and technical assistance to community lenders working to back clean technology projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities.  Harris said this was the first time federal dollars will be directly given to local non-profit organizations, who she said were best placed to make investments in their local communities.  Of the $20 billion, at least $4 billion will be dedicated to investment in rural communities and $1.5 billion will be directed to programs benefiting tribal nations.  The grantees are expected to mobilize almost $7 of private capital for every $1 of federal funds they spend.  William Barber, head of the Coalition for Green Capital - one of the selected organizations, said it was fitting that the announcement took place on the anniversary of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, and said the funding will help the US face the ""fierce urgency of climate change.""  ""Climate change is no longer a distant threat but an accelerating reality,"" said Barber, who said the awards will unlock the power of private and public capital to help all communities be able to help tackle the issue."

Rs 2280 crore) from a consortium comprising International Finance Corporation ( IFC ), Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) and  DEG  (Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH). While the World Bank Groupâs IFC is investing $125 million, ADB will be infusing $100 million and Germanyâs DEG will be pumping in $50 million to complete this round of fundraising. The  equity investment , which is the largest by these three players in the renewables space, will infuse capital to fund FPELâs business expansion plans, which includes a target portfolio of 3.5 GW of renewable energy assets by 2026, FPEL said on Tuesday. The existing investors in FPEL include Norfund and TPG. The Hyderabad-based FPEL already has an installed base of 1.5 GW of green assets and is gearing up to commission the first phase of its first 575 MW wind solar hybrid project under the inter-state transmission system (ISTS) route, in Karnataka, later during the current quarter. The RE player is currently developing additional capacities of 1.2 GW of open access projects across Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat while continuing its focus on ISTS, on-site solar and battery storage as key business verticals. It has already commissioned 2,000 projects for over 300 marquee clients such as Walmart, Unilever, Skoda, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Linde, Akzo Nobel, Ultratech Cement, Heidelberg, TCS and Wipro. Announcing the fundraise, Fourth Partner Energy co-founder and executive director Vivek Subramanian said the onboarding of the three development financial institutions (DFIs) as equity partners was a testament to the companyâs technical capabilities, team and strong ESG compliance. âFourth Partner Energy is now poised to transform the regionâs clean energy landscape and assist more businesses in reaching their RE100 goals in a just, equitable manner,â he added. âReducing the energy sectorâs carbon footprint is critical to realising Indiaâs green ambitions.

Monica Beck, member, DEGâs Managing Board, said FPEL combining rapid growth in building a solar and wind park portfolio with the high demands of first-class clients can be a driver of CO2 reduction and energy transition in India.

167,Adani Green operationalizes first 250 MW wind capacity at Khavda,"KHAVDA: AdGreen Energy Limited (AGEL), has operationalized the first 250 MW wind capacity at the world's largest 30,000 MW  renewable energy  plant located in  Khavda ,  Gujarat . According to a press release, this brings the cumulative operational capacity at the Khavda plant to 2,250 MW, reinforcing AGEL's leadership with a total operational portfolio of 11,184 MW across India. Wind energy  plays a crucial role in India's energy mix, ensuring a continuous supply of renewable energy by complementing solar power generation, which occurs during the day, with wind power, which is typically harnessed at night. Additionally, wind energy aids in grid stability by diversifying energy sources and, when paired with storage solutions, strengthens the renewable energy baseload. Khavda boasts some of the best wind resources in India, with wind speeds averaging around 8 meters per second, making it an optimal location for wind energy generation. The Khavda Renewable Energy plant is equipped with some of the world's largest and most powerful onshore wind turbine generators (WTG), each with a capacity of 5.2 MW. These high-capacity WTGs enable efficient land use, resulting in higher energy yields and reduced levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The 5.2 MW turbines feature a rotor diameter of 160 meters and a tip height of 200 meters, equivalent to the height of the Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue located in Gujarat. These WTGs are manufactured using advanced German technology at Adani New Industries Limited's (ANIL) integrated manufacturing ecosystem near the Mundra port, showcasing AGEL's commitment to building an indigenous supply chain and supporting the 'Made in India' initiative. AGEL has transformed the barren wasteland of Khavda into a hub of clean and affordable energy, capable of powering 16.1 million homes annually. With its proven expertise in developing ultra-large-scale renewable projects, a robust supply chain network, and technological prowess, AGEL is well-positioned to construct this unparalleled giga-scale plant in the global clean energy sector. AGEL conducted extensive studies and implemented numerous innovative solutions to expedite the development of the plant. In doing so, it supports the development of an indigenous and sustainable supply chain. The world's largest renewable energy plant at Khavda stands as a beacon for accelerating global decarbonization efforts and advancing India's sustainable development. AGEL, with support from its ecosystem of vendors, is developing the world's largest renewable energy project on barren land at Khavda in Kutch, Gujarat. Spanning 538 sq km, it is five times the size of Paris and nearly as large as Mumbai. Upon completion, it will be the largest power plant on the planet, irrespective of energy source. The region boasts approximately 2,060 kWh/m2 of high solar irradiation and some of the best wind resources in India, with wind speeds of around 8 meters per second. Before developing this site,  Adani Green  conducted geotechnical investigations, seismic studies, a centrifuge study by Cambridge, resource assessment and land studies, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD), and a detailed feasibility study over five years. The comprehensive infrastructure development included constructing approximately 100 km of roads, 50 km of drainage, desalination, and three reverse osmosis (RO) plants with a total capacity of 70 cubic meters per hour to meet the drinking water needs of project staff. Additionally, they laid 180 km of optical fibre cables for connectivity and built concrete batching plants. A township was also created to accommodate over 8,000 staff and workers, complete with medical facilities, a shopping complex, banking services, and leisure activities. The rapid development of this giga-scale project requires the combined strength and expertise of specialized partners within and outside the Adani portfolio. Which includes, supply of the largest onshore wind turbine manufactured by Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL), transmission network developed by Adani Energy Solutions (AESL), solar trackers from Jash Energy, cement and concrete from ACC and Ambuja Cements, logistic solutions from Adani Ports and SEZ (APSEZ), project execution, assurance, and management by Adani Infra India Limited (AIIL), digitally enabled operations by Adani Infrastructure Management Solutions Limited (AIMSL), Adani utility portfolio's globally recognized Energy Network Operation Centre (ENOC). Our indigenous supply chains and strong vendor networks are pivotal in realizing the world's largest renewable energy plant. The plant will feature cutting-edge technology, including India's largest onshore wind turbine generators of 5.2 MW capacity, bifacial solar PV modules (which generate energy from both sides of the module), and horizontal single-axis tracker systems (which track the sun for more energy). Additionally, it will use Adani's state-of-the-art Energy Network Operation Centre (ENOC) platform with AI and ML integration for real-time automated operation and monitoring. AGEL's partner Adani Infra is developing innovative solutions to address terrain challenges at Khavda. For example, they have deployed underground stone columns to enhance soil strength, developed with global collaboration involving both domestic and international institutions. Specialized corrosion-resistant coatings are also being used for solar module mounting structures and switchyard equipment to ensure long-term protection in highly corrosive environments. AGEL is engaged in community development initiatives across several villages, focusing on education, health, women empowerment, water conservation, and enhancing community infrastructure as part of its ESG efforts.

172,'Need attractive regime for China+1 to succeed',"Asian Development Bank  (ADB) chief economist Albert Park was in the Capital for the Kautilya Economic Conclave. In an interview, he told TOI that the agency is keeping close tabs on global crude prices to assess the impact of the escalating conflict in West Asia on the region and advocated that trade and investment channels should be kept open. Excerpts: Govt is focused on growth and they are trying to understand the costs and benefits of various economic policies in a pragmatic way. The pragmatism is leading to good outcomes as we see significant govt investment in infrastructure, efforts to reduce regulatory burden on firms and improved ease of doing business. The goal is to promote economic activity, raise productivity, promote more investments, and create more jobs. Our projection is of India growing at 7% this year and 7.2% next year. It is the highest growth for any economy in Asia. It may be possible to grow faster but the main thing is not to focus on any number, just continue to think about how the basic environment for business can improve. All the fundamentals are good, India is enjoying demographic dividend and there is a lot of positive sentiment among consumers and investors. Employment is an important issue. The good thing is poverty and inequality have reduced. If you try to create more jobs for less skilled sectors, then you will need to support more labour-intensive manufacturing and sectors where you have comparative advantage. The success of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat is the right way, and we should think how more states can do it. There may be some truth to that, but I am not sure if it affects our strategy, labour-intensive sectors still create a lot of jobs. Even as employment opportunities in manufacturing have a lower ceiling than in the past, opportunities in the services sector have increased because digitization is making services trade much more feasible. India has benefited from that... the only concern is that they tend to be more skill intensive. India should be pushing on all fronts. There are a lot of synergies between manufacturing and services. There is no rule about how much you should be producing in a global economy. If you think it reflects unfair trade practices, we have the WTO principles to guide us on what justifies countervailing or anti-dumping duty. Countries, rather than politicise trade, should stick to these principles and do due diligence and impose what is appropriate. We have seen shifts in FDI and trade flows. Countries that benefit the most are also the ones that are very competitive producers. Countries with a good investment environment have benefited, Vietnam, India, to some extent, Mexico due to proximity to the US. India and Indonesia also benefit from being big markets. It's an opportunity, especially, if it gives a foothold into new sectors, semiconductor chains, anything related to green transition. For India to maximise the gains, it needs to provide a very attractive investment environment, which can be improved over time. Just giving subsidies is not going to be sustainable. Security is a non-economic factor and govts must decide their priorities. From an economic standpoint, you should minimise restrictions. I wish the US and EU also took the view that if the trade balance is not good, allow Chinese firms to invest and produce. It creates more local employment and technology transfer."

175,Surat: Diamond City's $1.3 trillion economy roadmap launched,"SURAT: Calling  Gujarat  the growth engine of the Indian economy and the Diamond City of Surat ""Gujarat's growth engine"", CM Bhupendra Patel urged leaders from south Gujarat to work hard to achieve the goals set in the Economic Master Plan for the  Surat Economic Region  (SER). Patel launched the EMP for SER on Thursday in the presence of political, business and industry leaders from the region. The EMP for SER, prepared by  , includes Surat and its adjoining districts of Bharuch, Valsad, Navsari, Tapi and Dang. It focuses on growth of not only business and industrial activity but also education, tourism, agriculture and the environment.  While launching the plan, CM Bhupendra Patel said, ""The region will play a crucial role in making the state a $3.5 trillion economy by 2047 and create 34 lakh new jobs."" Beginning his speech, Patel said, ""You have clapped a lot, Gujarat is the growth engine of the country, and Gujarat's growth engine is Surat. Now, after clapping, it is the responsibility of all sitting here to ensure that the vision document is realized on the ground. The govt is with you,"" Patel said in his address. He further said, ""India became a global economic power under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, and now in his third term, he has given direction through  growth hubs  to make India the third-largest economic power in the world."" Along with Surat, NITI Aayog has identified Mumbai, Varanasi, and Visakhapatnam as growth hubs. ""While the  manufacturing sector  contributes 36% to the state's  , it contributes 55% to Surat's GDP. At the foundation of this achievement lie traditional industries like textiles, gems and jewellery, diamonds, and chemicals and dyes,"" Patel added. Discussing the  economic development  in the past, the CM said, ""For decades following 1960, Gujarat's development activities were limited to the belt from Vapi to Tapi. At that time, there seemed to be no prospects for development in Gujarat, which has seas, deserts, and mountains. There was no place or direction for the development of electricity, water, roads, or infrastructure. However, in the last two decades, Gujarat has picked up the pace of development. Evaluating the development over the two and a half decades since 2001, Gujarat has demonstrated what development should be like, its scale, and its speed."" In his address, C R Paatil, Union water resources minister, suggested that the NITI Aayog team include the sector of medical instrument manufacturing in its report. ""Though the sector is small, huge investment has been made in it. Business leaders from Surat had to give a bank guarantee of Rs 3 crore to get a flight in the past and soon there will be 100 flights,"" Paatil said. He thanked the govt for allocating Rs 5,000 crore for a deep-sea pipeline to dump industrial effluent. He suggested that the textile policy will be announced soon. ""The PM said that every state should prepare a vision document and with the support of NITI Aayog, Gujarat is the first state to make a vision document,"" said B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO of NITI Aayog. Explaining the growth hub concept, he said that to realize the $30 trillion economy target, cities will be growth engines. ""Nearly 1.5 crore people live in SER, comprising six districts, and its GDP stands at $72 billion, nearly 25% of Gujarat's gross domestic product. This region holds great potential, and that is why we have chosen it under the G-HUB initiative,"" he said. The SER is already a diamond, textiles and chemicals hub, but its tourism and agro-processing potential is still untapped, he said. ""We are aiming to lift the SER's GDP from the present $72 billion to $1.3 trillion by 2047, when India will be celebrating 100 years of Independence,"" Subrahmanyam said."
176,"Infrastructure progress not enough, India must boost manufacturing: Former RBI governor Rajan","NEW DELHI: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor   on Thursday said that India has made significant progress in infrastructure, in the past decade, but he believes more needs to be done to enhance local manufacturing and create jobs. In an interview with news agency PTI, the former RBI governor acknowledged the governmentâs intentions behind the ' ' initiative, which was launched on September 25, 2014, saying that while infrastructure improvements are commendable, other sectors require attention. ""But we need to check the other places. And the best way to check is to ask critics, what do you think? What has happened? Has it happened the way you want it? Should we do more? You get feedback, and then you work along,"" Rajan said. When asked about India's  economic growth  target, Rajan noted that a 7% growth rate could potentially position India ahead of Germany and Japan in a few years, given that their economies are currently valued at approximately $4.5 trillion and $4.2 trillion, respectively.  ""If you see that, then you put a 7 per cent growth rate, and you find it is not enough to become USD 15,000 per capita GDP by 2047 we need to do better,"" Rajan said. When asked about India's economic growth target, Rajan noted that a 7% growth rate could potentially position India ahead of Germany and Japan in a few years, given that their economies are currently valued at approximately $4.5 trillion and $4.2 trillion, respectively.  ""What is more worrisome, however, is when we say a developed nation. Now, what does it mean to be developed now? That is also a changing metric,"" the former governor said. He also talked about the importance of simplifying business regulations, reducing the fear of inspections, and creating a more conducive environment for entrepreneurs. Additionally, he cautioned against dismissing criticism of government policies as stemming from vested interests. Under 'Make in India', various measures, such as production-linked incentive schemes and improved foreign investment norms, have been introduced to support local manufacturing and exports."
177,"Shaktikanta Das stresses govt, RBI synergy in crisis","MUMBAI: Coordination between   and govt has helped bring down the trade-off between battling  inflation  and growth, RBI governor  Shaktikanta Das  said. RBI has steadfastly maintained that there is no trade-off between growth and inflation in the long term, as low inflation is a prerequisite for sustainable growth. However, its monetary action to curb inflation, besides dampening demand, also has an immediate impact on growth. According to Das, experiences in the aftermath of the pandemic have shown how coordinated monetary and fiscal policies can have better economic outcomes. ""During the pandemic, central banks worked in close coordination with govts to deal with the unprecedented crisis. Later, when central banks were battling against multi-decade high inflation, govts took measures on the supply side to ease inflationary pressures. Consequently, the output sacrifice needed to bring down inflation was minimised,"" said Das. He was delivering the First Himalaya Shumsher Memorial Lecture at Nepal Rastra Bank in Kathmandu on Tuesday. To soften the impact of the lockdown, RBI had infused liquidity to the tune of over Rs 5.5 lakh crore, which reduced the stress on businesses. Subsequently, when RBI was forced to hike interest rates in 2022 to cool inflation, govt took a number of measures to cool commodity prices that were seeing price spikes. In his speech, Das said that the model for central banking has changed over the last decade. While earlier central banks were focused on price stability as a sole objective, they now have a broader mandate that includes sustained growth and financial stability in addition to price stability. ""The trade-off between price stability and growth emerges when the pursuit of price stability entails large growth sacrifice,"" Das added."
178,Indian Students in Australia Pave the Way for the Future of India-Australia Relations,"NEW DELHI: India and Australia are rapidly advancing their partnership, with education and  economic growth  at the core.  Lisa Singh , CEO of the Australia India Institute, praised the strengthening ties between the two nations, emphasising the role of the  Indian diaspora  and government efforts in fostering this relationship. ""We are certainly a lot closer as partners today than we were ten or twenty years ago,"" Singh said, attributing this progress to collaboration across various sectors. Singh further highlighted the importance of people-to-people connections, especially the growing Indian community in Australia, which is now one million strong. ""The glue between Australia and India is really its people... and those that want to engage in business with India to understand its economic rise,"" she added, pointing to the complementary strengths of both nations in fields such as clean energy and education. Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan echoed this sentiment, describing the India-Australia relationship as ""incredibly strong"" during her visit to India. Allan pointed out that Victoria hosts the largest number of Indian-born Australian residents and international students, making education a key driver in the bilateral relationship. ""Education is an incredibly important part of our community and economy,"" she said, stressing the significance of ongoing collaboration between Indian and Victorian educational institutions. Allan also highlighted shared economic priorities, particularly in renewable energy, transport infrastructure, and housing, as key areas where India and Australia can work together. She said, ""We have a lot in common in terms of values but also our priority growth areas in terms of renewable energy and building better transport connections."" The Premier's visit to India also focused on engaging with women leaders to discuss ways to create more opportunities for women in both countries. Allan emphasised that strengthening education and economic opportunities for women would benefit both nations. She added, ""We all want the best for our kids, strong communities, and great education outcomes."" Both Singh and Allan agree that the growing partnership between India and Australia is built on shared values and the mutual benefits of increased collaboration in education, business, and renewable energy."
179,Moody's ups India's 2024 GDP growth forecast to 7.2% on strong growth,"Moody's Ratings on Thursday increased India's GDP growth forecast for the 2024 and 2025 calendar years to 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively, citing strong broad-based growth as a key factor. The ratings agency noted that growth could exceed projections if private consumption gains additional traction. Moody's Ratings highlighted that the Indian economy currently benefits from a blend of solid growth and moderating inflation. This assessment was part of their August update for the Global Macro Outlook for 2024-25. According to Moody's, ""From a macroeconomic perspective, the Indian economy is in a sweet spot, with the mix of solid growth and moderating inflation."" India's GDP growth is projected to be 7.2% in 2024, a significant rise from the previous estimate of 6.8%. For 2025, Moody's updated the projection to 6.6%, up from the earlier forecast of 6.4%. Moody's stated, ""We have raised our real GDP growth projections for the Indian economy for 2024 and 2025...These forecast changes assume strong broad-based growth."" The Indian economy showed a year-over-year expansion of 7.8% in the first quarter of 2024, despite the challenges posed by tight monetary policies and ongoing efforts toward fiscal consolidation. Moody's pointed out that signs of a revival in  rural demand  are emerging, bolstered by improving  agricultural output  prospects due to above-normal rainfall during the monsoon season. Bank and non-financial corporate balance sheets are in a much healthier state compared to pre-pandemic levels. Companies are also increasingly turning to equity and bond markets to raise capital. Additionally, a recent paper by the RBI forecasts a 54% surge in private capital expenditure for the current financial year. Moody's said, ""The capex cycle should continue to gain steam amid rising capacity utilisation, upbeat business sentiment and the government's continued thrust on infrastructure spending."" Supporting these growth dynamics is the rapid and widespread digitalisation of the economy. This is driven by government investments in digital public infrastructure, increased telecom and internet penetration, and low data usage costs. India's external position has also improved in recent years, with a significant reduction in the current account deficit. The quarter ending in March 2024 even registered a modest surplus, the first in 10 quarters, mainly due to robust service exports and strong remittance inflows. Additionally, India's ample foreign exchange reserves accumulated over the past decade provide the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with the capacity to intervene in forex markets to dampen rupee volatility during crises. Moody's noted, ""Over the medium- and longer-term, India's growth prospects depend on how well the country can productively tap its substantial pool of labour... Nevertheless, 6-7 per cent growth should be possible for the economy sheerly on the basis of present conditions."" India's population has a median age of 28 years, with about two-thirds in the working age group. While employment generation and skill development remain government priorities, the extent to which India can benefit from its demographic dividend will hinge on the effectiveness of these policies."
180,India needs 400 million more women in workforce by 2047 to fuel $14 trillion economy: Report,"NEW DELHI: India needs an additional 400 million women in the workforce by fiscal year 2047 to contribute $14 trillion to the economy, nearly doubling the current female  labour force participation  rate (LFPR) from 37 per cent to 70 per cent, according to a new report by The/Nudge Institute. According to The Labour Force Participation Distillation Report, based on the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data over the years, only 110 million women are projected to join the workforce by 2047, leaving a gap of 145 million women needed to meet the target. The report reveals significant disparities between men and women in job security and recovery. Women are seven times more likely to lose their jobs and eleven times more likely not to recover from job loss. By 2020, nearly half of the women employed in 2019 had exited the workforce, the report read. Women are predominantly employed in low-productivity sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, where advancement opportunities are limited. In the construction sector, women make up just over 12 per cent of the workforce and often earn less than men in unskilled roles. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened these issues, forcing many rural women back into the workforce due to income loss or job loss by primary earners, highlighting the fragility of female employment. The report identifies three key pathways to increase female labour force participation.  According to PTI, Director & Head of The/Nudge Prize, Kanishka Chatterjee said: ""India's demographic dividend and dreams of a $30 trillion economy cannot be realised without boosting the participation of women in the workforce."" He noted the progress made but stressed the need for urgent and sustained action to overcome economic, social, and cultural barriers. The/Nudge Prize team analyzed all of the PLFS data across the last two cycles of different sectors that are contributing to or witnessing higher growth rates to build this report. ""When we looked at PLFS data, we understood what the supply side is or where women or men work today. But there are no other data pointers available where we can clearly see what are the demand markers available in India which will hire women, or which may be better suited for women to take jobs or to drive their entrepreneurial journeys,"" the report said. ""One of the key things to consider, if we need to solve or address labour force participation rate, is to have a holistic approach. Not only to see how labour is available and what skills are available, but also to see what is driving demand today -- and this is exactly what we also bring out in the report,"" it added."
181,GST collection since its inception has shown buoyancy and remarkable growth: Experts,"NEW DELHI: After the  GST collection  for the August showed a month-on-month decline in growth terms, the  economic experts  pointed out that the decline on month-on-month growth basis is not an appropriate way of looking at the numbers in view of the  buoyancy  in both direct and indirect  taxes . The experts also noted that the GST collection since its inception has shown a  remarkable growth . The Goods and Services Tax revenue collection for August 2024 stood at Rs 1,74,962 crore, marking a 10 per cent increase compared to Rs 1,59,069 crore collected in August 2023.  ""The August figures may seem a monthly decrease in growth terms on sequential basis. But this would not be an appropriate way of looking at things in view of the buoyancy in both direct and indirect taxes, tax slab rationalization during the seven-year period"" said Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist, Informerics Ratings. ""In other words, when considered in a proper historical and comparative perspective, the GST collection has risen remarkably since its inception. It's difficult to record a consistently high growth rate on a constantly rising and much higher base. This base effect needs to be factored in for a comprehensive assessment of the evolving GST collection scenario in India,"" he added. Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in August, in gross terms, were at Rs 1.74 lakh crore, with a yearly jump of 10 per cent however, the GST collections in July were Rs 1.82 lakh crore. In May and June, the collections were at Rs 1.73 lakh crore and Rs 1.74 lakh crore, respectively. Experts also pointed out that the decline in the GST revenue is because of the increase in the refunds. ""Despite a decline in net GST revenue due to increased refunds, the continued growth in gross GST collections indicate a robust economy. The government's commitment to reduce working capital costs for businesses facing inverted duty structure is demonstrated by the higher domestic GST refunds"" said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY He also highlighted that ""By rationalizing rates, the government aims to address this issue over time. The positive growth in GST collections in Nagaland, Assam, Andaman & Nicobar, and Ladakh indicates holistic economic development across India"". According to the data, so far in 2024, the total GST collection has been 10.1 per cent higher at Rs 9.13 lakh crore, as against Rs 8.29 lakh crore mopped up in the corresponding period of 2023. "

Today, the discussion around Indiaâs EV adoption is focused on the need for developing the required indigenous infrastructure given the rising adoption of electric mobility for both four- and  two-wheelers . In a recent report by Bloomberg New Economy Forum, the electric two-wheeler market saw a substantial increase with sales growing by 13% to nearly 18 million units. To make electric mobility more affordable for Indians as well as meet the rising demand, the need of the hour is to develop the domestic EV manufacturing ecosystem, including the  chip design , which will power the EV industry in the coming years. This will not only help in deeper penetration of EVs but also make the country self-reliant in this critical sector. Indian chip design companies have an opportunity to carve a unique niche in the EV ecosystem by strategically addressing local needs and untapped opportunities. Traditionally, automotive electronics have always catered to four-wheelers. The progressive dependence of the driver on electronics for control, safety, comfort and entertainment in traditional internal combustion automobiles made investments in EV for four-wheelers a logical step for tier 1 suppliers and OEMs. This overlooks the massive two-wheeler market, which traditionally used basic electronics. The advent of EV has changed this, and the realization that two-wheelers, including the electric ones, are a dominant force in India and other developing economies opens up a new paradigm for  innovation  particularly in chips and electronics. This presents an opportunity for Indian chip design companies to bridge the gap by curating specialized, cost-efficient chips specifically designed to cater to the requirements of two-wheelers. This could involve chips addressing specific challenges faced in rural areas, such as last-mile navigation systems, enhanced battery management systems that function efficiently with the often-unpredictable power distribution in these regions, and components that can work under harsh climate conditions. These areas might not be top priorities for global players, but they hold immense significance for the  Indian market . That said, India's expanding two- and four-wheeler segments have also attracted the attention of global players lately. These companies are keen on partnering with Indian automotive OEM manufacturers to introduce innovative Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) chips. Such collaborations emphasize the importance of India's automotive market and the pivotal role domestic semiconductor companies can play in offering customized and cost-effective solutions. As vehicles become increasingly complex and connected, there is an escalating need for reliable, innovative, and locally produced  semiconductor solutions . Focus on innovation will be the key, and forward-looking policies like the Design Linked Initiative (DLI) and infrastructure funding aim to enable startups to come out with Proof of Concepts to cater to the local EV ecosystem. What we need now is a strong entrepreneurial drive to seize the opportunities presented by the Indian EV market. A strategic focus on emerging markets, addressing local needs, fostering collaboration within the electronics sector, and focusing on innovation can be a lucrative gambit for automotive-focused chip design startups."
190,Emerging hubs: Indiaâs new GCC innovation frontiers,"Cities like Indore, Coimbatore, Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam, long overshadowed by metropolises like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, are emerging as the new hotspots for the  technology industry .  Global capability centers  (GCCs) of  multinational corporations  are increasingly setting up shop in these cities, drawn by the promise of untapped talent pools, lower costs, and a better quality of life. âThe winds of change are here,â says Rahul Atri, managing director of Rakuten Symphony India. Based out of Indore, Rahul is at the forefront of this transformation. âIf we as leaders wonât do it, who else will? Somebody has to take the first step, create the playbooks and cheat books.â Rakuten Symphony, a telecom subsidiary of Japanâs Rakuten Group, has already filed over 300 patents from its Indore centre. The company delivers world-class software on telecom automation to clients across the globe. âThis is very special for people here,â Rahul notes with pride. âWe come from the heart of the country.â The rise of these  emerging hubs  aligns with the Indian governmentâs plan to develop the nation holistically. State governments are actively pitching these cities to GCCs, offering a range of incentives and support. But itâs not just about the bottom line. These emerging hubs offer a quality of life that is increasingly rare in the crowded, congested met ros. â33% of Indore has forest cover,â Rahul points out. âThe food is great, the cost of living is low, and thereâs a real sense of community here.â Indeed, the allure of these smaller cities is multifaceted. For companies, they offer a respite from the intense competition for talent in tech hubs like Bengaluru. âWhen I was at Mastercard, we had Vadodara as a huge hub,â recalls Sirisha Voruganti, CEO and MD of Lloyds Technology Centre. âOur attrition was in the very low singledigit numbers. This allowed us to retain a talent pool we had trained, significantly increasing our productivity.â Sirisha, a veteran in the tech industry with over 30 years of experience, sees these emerging hubs as a solution to the challenges faced by GCCs in major metros. âThe time is now to look at tier two and tier three locations in India. In the big cities, weâre dealing with high attrition rates and infrastructure issues. The tier two cities offer a refreshing alternative.â Of course, there are challenges in setting up in these emerging hubs. Connectivity, both physical and digital, can be an issue. âGovernments need to provide more than just tax benefits,â cautions Voruganti. âWe need good schools, hospitals, airports â an entire ecosystem to attract and retain talent.â This, she says, is particularly important to attract senior and mid-level talent. Senior talent is critical to ensure a GCC grows and innovates. Building this ecosystem requires a collaborative effort between GCCs, governments, and academia. âWe work with local universities to shape the curriculum, build electives, and polish the raw skills,â says Naved Narayan, VP of mobility solutions and head of the Coimbatore R&D centre of Bosch Global Software Technologies. âItâs a long process, but the results are worth it.â Bosch has been in Coimbatore for over 16 years now and has seen the city transform. âWhen we first came here, we had to start from scratch,â Narayan recalls. âBut now, there are many companies here, and the talent pool has grown tremendously.â This growth is not just quanti tative, but qualitative as well. âPeople here have great problem-solving skills,â Narayan notes. âThey are resourceful, eager to learn, and have a real hunger to make a difference.â This hunger is evident in the startups that are sprouting up in these cities, often with the support of the GCCs. âWe work with startups, incubate them, provide them access to our technology and markets,â Rahul says. âYou never know which part of their product can hit your business and help you grow.â As these emerging hubs grow, they are beginning to develop their own unique specialisations. Ahmedabad and Indore, for instance, are becoming known for their fintech and cybersecurity capabilities. Bhubaneswar is developing expertise in AI and machine learning. âFind your niche, think 20 years ahead,â Rahul advises. âWhen youâre thinking of setting up in these cities, think of the capabilities you want to build. Invest in sustainable data centres, in AI. Become a differentiator.â Srikanth Srinivasan, vice president at Nasscom, agrees that building talent is a journey that will take time. âThat would have been the case even for the larger cities at some point of time in the past decade or two. Itâs something that you need to work on.â To attract the right talent, Srinivasan recommends companies start the process as early as possible. âYou need to start now. And probably you will start getting results only three or five years from now.â The rise of these emerging hubs is not just a business imperative, but a social one as well. âItâs about the next generation, the next cities we want to invest in,â Rahul says. âIf we can create five more Bengalurus, ten more Hyderabads, we will truly be the India we all aspire to live in.â"
191,"Catalysing AI innovation with safeguards, says Ashwini Vaishnaw","BENGALURU: Union minister for electronics and IT,  , expressed confidence that technological innovation will continue to thrive despite the implementation of AI regulations. He emphasised that these regulations, which include appropriate safeguards, will not hinder the growth and development of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies. Vaishnaw's statement underscores the govt's commitment to foster a conducive environment to encourage  AI innovation . It also highlights the importance of ensuring that AI guardrails are in place to allay potential risks and concerns associated with AI. ""Our approach in the AI mission is basically the approach of democratising technology. Our Prime Minister has always mandated that technology has to be accessible to all the startups, academia, students, and researchers. It cannot be monopolised by a handful. So that's why the entire approach in our AI mission is to make sure that the public investment creates an infrastructure which is then used by multiple people,"" he said at the tenth edition of the The  Economic Times Startup Awards  (ETSA) 2024, held in Bengaluru on Saturday. ""We have two different models before us. One is the US model. The second is the European model. I honestly don't think that the way some of the countries have put so much regulation on AI is the right way to go. The way we created a structure in our data privacy law and in the telecom law, we've allowed the space for innovation to flourish. We ensured that while providing this space, the potential harms that could affect society were fully controlled. We will be able to apply this approach in the case of AI as well,"" he added. He said the govt has consistently leveraged pre-existing structures within welfare programmes. He cited the example of  digital identities , which play a central role in both the healthcare and agriculture industries. ""The Prime Minister launched the agriculture mission. With digital lending, we want to create a system where big banks and lenders pursue loans less than $10. Now, loans worth $200 million have been disbursed where the average ticket size is Rs 2,000. Many startups are working on such solutions. It has taken us two years to get here,"" Vaishnaw said. Addressing the policy decision to have more FM stations and withdrawing the broadcast bill, Vaishnaw said the govt is looking to build the  creator economy  to harness India's soft power. ""There is a huge creator's economy. The way tech has emerged, it is possible for someone from a village to do videos on the culture of that place or cuisine and become a global sensation,"" he added. In a fireside chat with Infosys co-founder and chairman Nandan Nilekani, Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal said the current economic scenario presents an opportunity for entrepreneurs to demonstrate to investors their ability to effectively allocate profits. ""Earlier the question was whether startups can make profits. Everybody is starting to make profits now,"" Bansal said. His remarks come at a time when investors are increasingly asking startups to generate returns from the capital they raised during the period of low interest rates. Nilekani is also the jury chair for this year's awards. Bansal also emphasised the importance of startups being prudent with their financial resources. ""If the company starts treating a Rs 1 lakh as Rs 1, then something is going to be wrong. I have seen that in my own company,"" he cautioned, highlighting the need for responsible financial management within startups. Nilekani also steered the discussion towards the concept of 'grandfathering of startups,' referring to the trend of startup founders continuously establishing and nurturing new ventures."

194,How infra development is having a social impact in Mumbai: Experts discuss at the Maha Infra Town Hall,"The  Maha Infra Town Hall , a collaborative effort between the  Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority  (MMRDA) and The Times of India, took place on Tuesday, October 8, 2024, at Mumbai's National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA). The event brought together influential policymakers, stakeholders, and industry experts to discuss the rapid  infrastructure development  in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region ( MMR ). The conclave provided insights into the latest projects and investment prospects in Maharashtra. The event featured three panel discussions, with the second panel delving into the ""Social Impact of Infra development"" projects in the MMR. The panelists examined how enhanced infrastructure has improved the quality of life for residents and fostered social equity in the region. The MMR is already making significant strides in infrastructure development, with projects such as the  Bandra-Worli Sea Link , multiple Metro lines, and other crucial initiatives paving the way for progress. Santosh Rai, the Operations Director and CBO of  HCC , a company that significantly contributed to the construction of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, provided essential information about the project. He emphasized that it was among the most technologically demanding endeavors undertaken in India. Rai highlighted the immense suspended weight of the bridge during its construction phase, which reached an impressive 2,500 tonnes. He also noted that the project's marine nature posed unique challenges, as climatic conditions restricted construction activities to specific periods throughout the year. To ensure the structural integrity of the sea link, the HCC team strategically minimized the number of cables used in the construction process. This decision was crucial in reducing vibrations caused by the sea, thereby enhancing the overall stability and durability of the structure. Nalin Gupta, MD of  J Kumar Infraprojects  Ltd, a company instrumental in constructing Mumbai's metro stations and a pioneer in introducing pre-cast technology for public transport, added, âMumbai never sleeps,"" making it impractical to carry out heavy construction during the day, while night work presented unique obstacles.â The traffic density in Mumbai is higher than in other metropolitan cities and Tier II and Tier III cities. Although not their primary responsibility, the company encountered challenges with space allocation, traffic diversion, and the relocation of affected residents. Constructing 25 stations within 30 months during the project's first phase was a daunting task. To adhere to the schedule, they pioneered the use of precast technology for public transport in India. While tunnelling projects were less complicated than elevated ones, building underground metro stations was particularly challenging, as the entire ground level had to be cleared for the excavation process. Vijay Karia, the owner of  Ravin Group , emphasized the substantial difficulties in supplying power for these infrastructure initiatives. He noted: ""Bringing electricity to Mumbai is particularly challenging, as overhead wires require a vast amount of space."" Despite the skepticism from numerous global firms, Karia's company achieved the feat of providing an extra 1,800 megawatts of electricity using an innovative approach. The electricity was transmitted through direct cables hung at a height of 40 meters, leading to the towers.  From that point, the power was directed underground to facilitate the metro construction. This groundbreaking method was unprecedented in Asia, marking a significant milestone in the region's infrastructure development. Inaugurating The Maha Infra Town Hall, Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee said, âMMRDA is guided by three simple things; first one is rebooting of Mumbai, second is reshaping of MMR region, and third is a catch line, which is called Mumbai in minutes.â âWe intend to reshape Mumbai in a way that will be most suitable for the requirements of the MMR region and the residents of that area. We say we'll make it world class, but more than that, we'll make it something which resonates with the people who live there,â he said."

198,Budget 2024 expectations: Strategic interventions and an innovation-first approach will drive growth for Indian logistics,"Budget 2024 expectations : All eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the  Union Budget 2024 , on July 23. The  logistics sector  is especially hopeful, given the Rs 11 lakh crore boost allocated by the Interim Budget in February, by way of three major economic railway corridor programmes, including energy, mineral and cement corridors, port connectivity corridors, and high-traffic density corridors, under the  PM Gati Shakti scheme . Looking ahead, we perceive the upcoming budget presenting a unique opportunity to balance the nationâs economic growth priorities with fiscal consolidation.  To sustain the growth momentum of the logistics sector, prioritising capital expenditure in key infrastructure projects, alongside financial incentives such as PLI, tax benefits and subsidies are crucial as these will help drive innovation in logistics. Further, establishing a âOne Indiaâ logistics ecosystem and integrating initiatives such as the National Logistics Policy and Sagarmala Project are crucial in terms of enhancing Indiaâs ranking on the global Logistics Performance Index. To reinforce Indiaâs potential as a manufacturing powerhouse, the budget must focus on domestic manufacturing, and on preparing the logistics sector for service integration, growth in fulfilment logistics and multi-modal transportation adoption. The government should also consider automation investments, especially in technologically advanced warehouses, which can position India as a logistics innovation leader. We anticipate a stronger push for the EV industry, in the form of tax incentives, charging infrastructure subsidies and financial support for R&D. Establishing a holistic regulatory framework for last-mile delivery and formal recognition of the gig workforce under labour laws are essential to ensure fair employment practices in todayâs digital economy. The logistics industry is a crucial driver of economic efficiency, and we are hopeful for the budget to include transformative measures that will drive innovation and inclusivity in the sector. We urge the government to address the logistics sectorâs unique needs by enhancing the strategic allocations toward  infrastructure development , tax reforms and other governance policies. Besides this, a renewed focus on setting up digitally advanced processes with the use of cutting-edge technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, and big data will streamline efficiency. We hope the government will consider the inclusion of diesel under the GST ambit as this is a critical move in enabling India to reduce its logistics costs and become more competitive in the international market. It will also help key logistics players to regulate costs by cutting down on tax outflows. As we await the release of the Interim Budget, the logistics sector is primed for transformative measures that will fuel our nationâs journey to a USD 5 trillion economy. The forthcoming budget presents a significant opportunity to reinforce our commitment to enhancing the ease of doing business with India. Indiaâs logistics costs, as highlighted by DPIIT, are encouraging; but our gaze must look beyond mere cost considerations. A strategic allocation of resources towards infrastructure, competence and traceability is essential for sustained progress.  A sustained focus on and adopting a long-term perspective towards building key physical and digital infrastructure, incentivising multimodal logistics for carbon reduction, and robust skilling initiatives for the 22 million individuals employed in the sector should be the key priorities for the upcoming budget. To boost EXIM trade and improve competitiveness, we must maintain the momentum in investments and digitalisation. This approach will empower India to progress rapidly towards a more resilient and sustainable transport and logistics ecosystem."
199,Budget 2024: EV sector seeks comprehensive support and innovation boost,"With the  Union Budget 2024  around the corner, Indiaâs electric vehicle (EV) industry is bracing for crucial policy announcements. The sector, which has witnessed significant growth in recent years, is now at a juncture where industry leaders believe that the support from the central government will help in maintaining the growth momentum. That said, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) India scheme, which has been instrumental in driving EV adoption, concluded on March 31, 2024. While the scheme has provided a much-needed support, challenges such as limited charging infrastructure and high battery costs persist. Later, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) launched the  Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme  (EMPS) to enhance the adoption of two-wheeler and three-wheeler electric vehicles and support EV development and manufacturing in India. The EMPS-2024, with a   of Rs. 500 crore, is set to expire on July 31, 2024. It offers subsidies of up to Rs 10,000 for two-wheeler EVs, up to Rs 25,000 for small three-wheeler EVs, and up to Rs 50,000 for large three-wheeler EVs. Now, with the Union Budget set to be presented in the parliament on July 23, 2024, letâs take a look at what the  budget expectations  from the EV industry looks like. Chetan Maini, Co-founder and Chairman of SUN Mobility, highlighted the need for comprehensive support in the upcoming Budget to bolster India's EV ecosystem. He said, âIndia is paving the way for the EV evolution, with the government taking constructive steps toward clean mobility and adhering to its net-zero emission goals. In the upcoming Budget, the industry seeks a level playing field for all technologies, emphasizing the need to address disparities in GST and subsidies, particularly for swappable batteries,â âAnticipated measures include a comprehensive Battery Swapping Policy, the launch of FAME III, with an increased allocation for e-buses, and proposals to incentivize local production of EV components, all aimed at fortifying Indiaâs EV ecosystem,â he added. Madhumita Agrawal, Founder and CEO of Oben Electric, sees the Budget as a pivotal moment for the  EV sector 's growth. She added, âCurrently, manufacturers face a significant cash flow squeeze due to the higher GST rates on raw materials (18-28%) compared to the lower GST rate on the final vehicle (5%). We hope the budget will address this disparity to reduce the burden on manufacturers, eventually transferring the cost benefit to the consumer.â Akash Gupta, Co-founder and CEO of Zypp Electric, believes policy continuity is crucial for achieving net-zero carbon emissions. He asserts, âInclusion in the priority lending scheme and reducing GST for EV services from 18% to 5% will accelerate EV-led delivery adoption. Recognizing last-mile delivery as a distinct sector under logistics policies is essential,â âEstablishing industry standards, supporting gig delivery partners with tailored schemes, and implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) will enhance efficiency and foster growth in this vital but often overlooked segment of the logistics industry. An extension of the existing EMPS scheme will result in better stakeholder sentiment and investor confidence.â he concluded. Niraj Rajmohan, CTO and Co-Founder of Ultraviolette, advocates for robust support in deep tech R&D and innovation. He notes, âThe next phase of the sectorâs growth will be strongly hinged on our ability to evolve into an independent technology creator. We advocate for initiatives and subsidy structures without segment caps which will in turn foster innovation and growth across multiple segments.â âRecent discussions surrounding the implementation of FAME 3 present a notable opportunity to enhance EV adoption in India. In light of this, any extension of the FAME subsidy and removing all caps on the ex-factory price of EVs will be pivotal in enhancing the position of tech forward companies like Ultraviolette.â Ashwin Bhandari, CEO and Co-founder of iVOOMi, suggests key fiscal measures for sustainable industry growth. He recommends, âIn the upcoming budget, we propose a significant integration of GST rates for batteries and scooters, aiming to create a balanced sales taxation system while addressing key factors such as battery technology, supply chain efficiency, and market inventories. This strategic approach is poised to drive sustainable growth within the industry.â"
200,"IFC keen to work with UP infra, agri-tech development","Lucknow: Chief Minister   held a meeting with Makhtar Diop, the global managing director of the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ), in Lucknow on Saturday. They discussed the state's development towards a USD 1 trillion economy and collaboration in the areas of infrastructure and agricultural technology. Accompanied by chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, the CM and the IFC delegation explored the possibility of  public-private partnership  (PPP) projects. IFC showed particular interest in contributing to the state's development in infrastructure and AgTech.

Diop mentioned that IFC and the World Bank Group (WBG) can jointly help establish a pooled financing structure for the state to attract private capital into urban infrastructure. A pooled commercial financing structure could draw on the financial strength of UP to address collective funding requirements for urban infrastructure, he added. The official said that with the support of the WBG 100 Cities programme, a state intermediary could raise loans on a pooled basis with a govt guarantee or credit enhancement. The WBG-ADB 100 Cities programme, in coordination with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, aims to deliver bankable projects in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management services in 100 cities. The programme is in its preparatory stages. Since 2007, IFC has invested nearly USD 750 million in 29 projects in sectors such as chemicals and fertilisers, housing, renewable energy, telecommunications, health, and food processing. IFC also signed an MoU with the Department of Infrastructure and Industrial Development in July 2023, under which IFC is providing advisory services for the procurement, operation, and maintenance of e-buses. It has also engaged with the UP govt for advisory on PPPs and AgTech. It was previously engaged as a transaction advisor on the Jhansi Solar Project to assist the client in structuring and tendering a solar power park project of 600MW in Jhansi. IFC has also contributed to several projects to promote investment in AgTech in UP. Under this, IFC's India Agritech Advisory Project (IAAP) is benefiting more than 30,000 farmers, he said. IFC has also invested in sewage treatment plant projects for the revival of the Ganga river in collaboration with the Jal Nigam and the National Mission for Clean Ganga on a PPP mode. "

202,Google to invest $1 billion in Thailand," plans to invest $1 billion to build  digital infrastructure  in Thailand, including a new  data centre , the US tech giant has announced, saying the move would support 14,000 jobs in the kingdom. The new hubs in Bangkok and the industrial area of Chonburi are intended to help meet growing demand for  cloud computing  in Southeast Asia, the company said in a Monday statement. Google's investment comes after Microsoft announced in May that it would create Thailand's first data centre region to boost cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. ""These investments will empower Thai businesses, innovators, and communities to harness the power of cloud and AI technology,"" Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Google and its parent company Alphabet, said. The investment's details were unveiled after a Bangkok meeting between Porat and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who hailed the move as proof Thailand was becoming a major digital hub in Southeast Asia. The data centre will be located in Chonburi, a major industrial area southeast of Bangkok, while the cloud facilities will be in the capital itself. Google's expansion in Thailand will add $4 billion to the kingdom's GDP by 2029 and support 14,000 jobs between 2025 and 2029, the company said, citing a report from consultancy Deloitte. The announcement comes a year after Shinawatra's predecessor Srettha Thavisin made a major push for investment from US tech giants during a trip to New York, seeking finance from Google, Microsoft and Elon Musk's Tesla. Thailand is Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, but its tech sector has lagged behind the likes of Singapore and Indonesia. The Thai economy, long focused on traditional manufacturing, agriculture and tourism, has struggled to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic. The government hopes investment from Google, Microsoft and their ilk will diversify and modernise the kingdom's economy. Thailand's Office of the National Digital Economy and Society Commission has said the digital economy could contribute as much as 30 percent of GDP by 2027. Across the region, governments are vying for US tech dollars, with Vietnam making a drive to move up the value chain from its traditional base as a hub for producing shoes, clothes and furniture. Vietnam hopes to cash in on the US move to become less dependent on China for key resources including high-tech chips. And last week, Vietnamese state media reported that Musk's SpaceX plans to invest $1.5 billion in the communist country."

These collaborations will help OEMs stay competitive and maximize value."
204,CM: Explore opportunities for jobs in private sector,"Vijayawada: Chief minister   on Thursday directed the officials to explore opportunities to create jobs in the private sector.  In a review meeting with the officials of industries, MSME, SERP, and skill development departments, Naidu told the officials to create hybrid work models to create  employment opportunities  in rural areas. Naidu asked the officials to come up with innovative and out-of-the-box ideas for employment generation. He said that creating two million employment opportunities in the coming five years is the priority for the state govt. Naidu stated that through skill training and upgradation, the govt should focus on filling the gap between industry needs and available human resources. Recollecting his recent interactions with flood victims in Vijayawada, Naidu said that several victims requested jobs as they lost everything. He told the officials to prepare an action plan to provide employment opportunities to people in flood-affected areas. In another review meeting with the officials of youth affairs and sports, Naidu criticised the previous YSRC govt for neglecting sports completely for five years. He said that during the previous TDP regime, the construction of stadiums and the development of playgrounds were taken up on a massive scale. Naidu directed the officials to complete all pending works of playgrounds, stadiums, and other infrastructure works expeditiously. Naidu said that 23 crore is being sanctioned for the purpose. He said that sports are not only for those who participate in competitions but should be made part of everyone's lifestyle. Playing a sport on a daily basis will make them fit and keep them in good health.  Recalling that earlier people used to play kabaddi and volleyball in almost all the villages, he expressed concern that this practice has disappeared after TVs and smartphones came into existence. Naidu told the officials to involve locals in developing playgrounds in rural areas. If Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and industrialists come forward to fund these playgrounds, they can be named after them, he added. Naidu set a target of hosting 2027 National Games in  . He said that the required  sports infrastructure  should be made ready by then. Though the sports policy was formed in 2017, it came to an end in 2022, and the YSRCP govt did not take the initiative to formulate a new policy, he said and stressed the need to formulate a new sports policy. He said that sports infrastructure should be developed in all major cities like Tirupati, Amaravathi, and Visakhapatnam. Naidu further told officials to take steps to set up sports centres in all the district collectorates and other govt offices. "
205,Infra works backbone for inclusive policies: CM,"Bhopal: Chief minister Mohan Yadav on Thursday said that infrastructure works are the backbone on which economic and inclusive development policies take shape. Yadav made the remark while virtually addressing a conference organised in Bhopal by the Construction Industry Development Council (CIDC). Yadav also inaugurated the conference on âIncorporation of Innovations in Infrastructure Construction'. Commenting on the use of technology in the infrastructure sector, he said, ""We should recognise the power of technology, make good use of it, and fulfil the resolve in the interest of society so that along with this generation, the coming generations too can benefit.""

Noting that the event has been organised on teachers' day, he said, ""Today we will get new inspiration on teachers' day, dedicated to Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. You all know that the Guru-Shishya tradition has special importance in Indian culture. Keeping this in view, the Madhya Pradesh govt has decided to celebrate the festival of Guru Purnima at the govt level. It is a matter of happiness that the name of vice chancellors has now been changed to Kulgurus."" CM Yadav said that researchers are like scientific gurus. The spirit of public interest in the field of research has been in our tradition since ancient times. On the occasion, MLA Satish Malviya, Ujjain divisional commissioner Sanjay Gupta, and inspector general of police Santosh Kumar Singh were also present at CM's residence in Ujjain. "
206,Climate change impacts women in developing regions particularly: Sowmiya Anbumani,"CHENNAI:  Climate change , an urgent global issue, impacts all of humanity, most particularly  women  in  developing regions , said  Pasumai Thaayagam Foundation  president  Sowmiya Anbumani  on Thursday. Speaking at the 37th meeting of the 57th regular session of the United Nation's Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Switzerland on Thursday, Sowmiya said  gender inequality  and environmental degradation aggravate the disproportionate impact on women, especially in agriculture, water security, health, nutrition and climate-induced migration. âWomen make up a significant portion of the agricultural workforce, particularly in developing regions. Climate change increases the frequency of droughts, floods, cyclones and extreme weather events, severely threatening the livelihoods of these women, exposing them to safety risks, health risks and physical exhaustion, thereby reducing their time for education, employment and empowerment,â she said. She said every year hundreds of thousands of adolescent girls discontinue their school education due to lack of water in their school toilets triggered by climate change.  âAddressing the disproportionate impact of climate change on women requires empowering women through education, land rights, access to resources and involving women in decision-making process at local, national and international levels,â she suggested. She held Western countries responsible for the historical emissions since the Industrial Revolution contributing heavily to climate change. âDeveloping countries and island nations, despite contributing the least, face the most severe impacts. Hence, I sincerely urge the world leaders to take immediate action to cut down on emissions and ensure gender equity in climate action and a sustainable future for all,â she said."
207,Workers see dramatic fall in share of global income: UN,"GENEVA: Workers have seen their slice of the  global income  pie shrink significantly over the past two decades, swelling  inequality  and depriving the combined labour force of trillions, the UN said Wednesday. The United Nations' International Labour Organization said that the global  labour income share  -- or the proportion of total income in an economy earned by working -- had fallen by 1.6% points since 2004. ""While the decrease appears modest in terms of percentage points, in 2024 it represents an annual shortfall in labour income of $2.4 trillion compared to what workers would have earned had the labour income share remained stable since 2004,"" the  ILO  said in a report. The study highlighted the Covid-19 pandemic as a key driver of the decline, with almost half of the reduction in labour income share taking place during the pandemic years of 2020-2022. The global crisis exacerbated existing inequalities, particularly as capital income has continued to concentrate ever more among the wealthiest, it said. ""Countries must take action to counter the risk of declining labour income share,"" Celeste Drake, the ILO deputy director-general, said in a statement. ""We need policies that promote an equitable distribution of economic benefits, including freedom of association, collective bargaining and effective labour administration, to achieve inclusive growth, and build a path to sustainable development for all."" The ILO stressed that technological advances, including automation, were a key driver of the declines in labour income share. ""While these innovations have boosted productivity and output, the evidence suggests that workers are not sharing equitably from the resulting gains,"" the UN labour agency said. It voiced particular concern that the artificial intelligence boom risked deepening inequality further. ""If historical patterns were to persist... the recent breakthroughs in generative AI could exert further downward pressure on the labour income share,"" the report said, stressing ""the importance of ensuring that any benefits of AI are widely distributed"". The ILO found that workers currently rake in just 52.3% of global income, while capital income -- earned by owners of assets like land, machines, buildings and patents -- accounts for the rest. Since capital income tends to be concentrated among wealthier individuals, the labour income share is widely used as a measure of inequality. It also helps measure progress towards the UN sustainable development goal aimed at significantly reducing inequality between and within countries between 2015 and 2030. ""The report indicates slow progress as the 2030 deadline approaches,"" ILO said. The report also emphasised the stubbornly high incidence of young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). Since 2015, the global percentage has slipped slightly, from 21.3% to 20.4% this year. But there are major regional differences, with a third of youth in Arab states and nearly a quarter in Africa falling into the NEET category.  The report also highlighted a large gender gap, with the global NEET incidence among young women standing at 28.2% -- more than double the 13.1% seen among young men."

209,"Rich get richer: World's top 1% got $42 trillion new wealth in past decade, says Oxfam","The wealthiest 1 per cent of the  global population  has accumulated $42 trillion in new wealth over the past ten years, which is nearly 34 times more than the entire bottom 50 percent of the world's population, according to a recent analysis by  Oxfam . The average wealth per person in the top 1 percent increased by approximately $400,000 in real terms during this period, while a person in the bottom half saw an average increase of just $335, equivalent to less than nine cents per day. As  G20  finance ministers prepare to meet in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, they are expected to establish the groundwork for a landmark global agreement to raise taxes on the  super-rich . This proposal, supported by countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Spain, and France, comes amidst growing public demand for measures to curb extreme levels of inequality and ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. ""Inequality has reached obscene levels, and until now governments have failed to protect people and planet from its catastrophic effects,"" said Oxfam International's Head of Inequality Policy, Max Lawson in a press release. ""The richest one percent of humanity continues to fill their pockets while the rest are left to scrap for crumbs."" Oxfam's research reveals that a ""war on fair  taxation "" has led to a significant reduction in  tax rates  on the wealth and income of the richest individuals. In G20 countries, less than eight cents of every dollar raised in tax revenue now comes from taxes on wealth.  Additionally, the share of income earned by the top 1 percent in G20 countries has increased by 45 percent over four decades, while top tax rates on their incomes have been reduced by approximately a third. On a global scale, billionaires have been paying a tax rate equivalent to less than 0.5 percent of their wealth, despite their fortunes growing by an annual average of 7.1 percent over the past four decades. Oxfam estimates that an annual net wealth tax of at least 8 percent would be necessary to reduce the extreme wealth of billionaires, with G20 countries being home to nearly 80 percent of the world's billionaires."

The latest data is expected to add to the raging debate over the extent of inequality in the country with some experts saying it had increased while others have said that it has shown a decline after a spike during the Covid-19 pandemic period. The Gini coefficient, a statistical measure of inequality in the population, shows a decline, from 0.283 to 0.266 for the rural sector and from 0.363 to 0.314 for the urban sector of the country, according to the survey results. âA decline in the Gini coefficient across urban and rural areas suggests a reduction in income inequality between 2011-12 and 2022-23. Remarkably, income inequality has decreased both in industrially advanced states and in states that have not performed well in attracting businesses,â said Nilanjan Banik, professor of economics at Mahindra University. The NSSO had earlier released a fact sheet on the household consumption expenditure data. While commenting on those numbers, Niti Aayog CEO B V R Subrahmanyam had said that based on the household consumption survey data the poverty level in the country could be closer to 5% or less. The household consumption expenditure survey has been released after more than 10 years as the one in 2017-18 was put on the backburner due to inconsistencies in the data. The survey results are used to extrapolate poverty estimates, update GDP numbers. âThe survey reveals that the share of consumption at the bottom 50% fractile classes expanded faster in urban areas during FY12 and FY23 including those at the lowest pyramid at 0-5%. In rural areas, there was also a concomitant shift though the pace was slower. There is also a pronounced decline in estimated Gini coefficient in rural and urban areas over the period. Interestingly, across states for rural areas, the estimated Gini coefficient is higher than all India for states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. For urban areas, Haryana and Kerala have higher Gini coefficient than all India. Thus states seem to be doing better on an average in terms of distribution across rural and urban areas,â said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India. The results also showed the Gini coefficient for various states for both urban and rural areas. The survey for 2022-23 has undergone some changes in terms of coverage of items, change in questionnaire, multiple visits for data collection and mode of data collection which has prompted some experts to raise issues linked to comparing the results of the current survey with the previous ones. The average estimated monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 was Rs 3,773 in rural and Rs 6,459 in urban India. âThus, the per capita expenditure level in the urban areas, in nominal terms, and ignoring rural-urban differences in price levels, has been about 71% more than that in the rural areas,â according to the survey. Among the major states, MPCE is the lowest in Chhattisgarh for rural (Rs 2,466) as well as urban (Rs 4,483) sectors. It is the highest in Kerala (Rs 5,924) in rural areas and Telangana (Rs 8,158) in urban areas. Separate surveys conducted by independent think tanks have shown a decline in inequality. âIndiaâs income inequality  declined  in 2022-23 for the first time since the pandemic, with the income Gini index decreasing by 23%, from 0.506 to 0.390. This improvement is primarily due to the significant recovery of the bottom 50% of households which include labourers, petty traders, small business owners, and small and marginal farmers, according to our ICE 360 survey,â said Rajesh Shukla, MD and CEO of PRICE, a private economic think tank. âTheir share of total household income rose from 15.8% in 2020-21 to 22% in 2022-23. Govt welfare schemes introduced in response to the pandemic significantly contributed to the decrease in income inequality,â said Shukla."

212,Does Art 39(b) allow govt to take over your property?,"Amid polls to constitute the 18th Lok Sabha, the governing party and the opposition have clashed over a critical question â how much inequality is India willing to tolerate? In its manifesto, Congress has promised to conduct a nationwide caste census to determine the socio-economic conditions of various caste and sub-caste groups. Congress functionaries have taken umbrage to the unfair concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few individuals. BJP has hit back, accusing Congress of appeasement politics and termed this exercise an attempt to extract private wealth from individuals and redistribute it among minorities. The issue is philosophical: to whom do a countryâs material resources belong? As this debate rages on in election rallies and across TV newsrooms, the   is quietly preparing to answer this question. While deciding a seemingly innocuous set of property disputes originally filed in 1992, the SC has felt the need to re-interpret Article 39(b) of the Constitution, a directive principle of state policy which urges the state to make policies to ensure âthat the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as to best subserve the common goodâ. Generally, directive principles of state policy are unenforceable by a court of law. A member of the Constituent Assembly even described the entire part as a âdustbin of sentimentâ. But Article 39(b) is different. It is underwritten by Article 31C â which provides that a law made by Parliament in furtherance of Article 39(b) is not invalid even if it violates fundamental rights such as  equality  and freedom of trade. It is worth mentioning that the linkage between the two provisions is also an issue before the Supreme Court in this very case. Of course, the expression âmaterial resourcesâ must include public resources. The question is simple: does it include private resources as well? A recent study by the World Inequality Database has stated that  wealth inequality  in India is now higher than what it was during British rule in India. In light of this, Parliament could potentially enact a âwealth taxâ where all citizens with a certain net worth would be taxed 2% of their wealth. Challenging the law because it violates fundamental rights such as equality, life and personal liberty, and freedom of trade would be futile, because Article 39(b), backed up by Article 31C, would kick in. Another example includes a law to acquire all privately held forest land across the country and distribute it among tribal communities who are displaced by climate change, infrastructure projects, internal conflict etc. A mere reference in such an Act to Article 39(b) will save it from being struck down. The implications of this case go beyond the immediate political debate. Its significance lies in how the apex court interprets the constitutional guarantee of equality, and how much power it gives to the state to fulfil this guarantee. A restrictive interpre tation will assign the role of reducing inequality to the private market, hoping that âinvisible handâ will reach everyone. A broader interpretation will give greater powers to the state to interfere in private affairs to ensure proper redistribution of wealth. Underlying this provision is an assumption that the state may be better capable of ensuring equality. This may be true in some cases, but very false in others. During the hearings, CJI Chandrachud stated that Article 39(b) could not be interpreted in a purely communist or socialist sense. He seemed to detect a Gandhian flavour to the provision. It is hence likely that the SC will give us a more nuanced interpretation of Article 39(b).  Private property  may not be wholly excluded, but certain kinds of private property may be declared to be held in trust. The authors are with the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy"
213,âChange lifestyle to reduce carbon footprintâ,"Mangaluru: Prof Sachin Chaturvedi, director general of the Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), New Delhi, called for a change in  lifestyle  to reduce carbon footprints. Delivering the 42nd annual convocation address at Mangalore University, he said the purpose of  LiFE  (Lifestyle for Environment) is to make sustainable lifestyles a mass movement. âIn recognition of Indiaâs efforts in changing the global debate on  climate change , the G20 Bali Leadersâ Declaration endorsed the concept of  sustainable development  and lifestyles, resource efficiency, and circular economy. Under Indiaâs presidency of G20, LiFE gained added momentum as it won support from the international community as well as from those aspiring for a healthy green lifestyle,â he said. Stating that there are five prominent facets of LiFE, he mentioned, âThey are sustainable consumption and production (SCP), including circular economy; reorienting development finance and promoting resilient infrastructure financing; measuring wellbeing going beyond GDP; embracing social enterprises and community participation for sustainable and equitable development; and mainstreaming ethical and value-based economic systems, technology development, and global governance.â He emphasised that LiFE has a vital role in accelerating the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). âAs the world grapples with the alarming pace of climate change, rising inequality, and the need for an ethical reformation of global relations, LiFE emerges as a practical pathway toward a sustainable and equitable future,â he said. The chancellor of the university and Karnataka governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot, in his presidential address, called upon students, including those who obtained PhD., to take up the responsibility of spreading education, especially among poor children in villages. âIf possible, help children who are not able to afford education expenses. Education plays a major role in making life successful. Education makes one skilled and thereby helps in achieving success in life. Blend education with values so that it will help in the well-being of the world and mankind,â the governor said. Stressing the need for a reduction of the gap in environmental imbalance, Gehlot said everyone should put their best efforts to reduce the ecological imbalance. He also insisted on replacing the use of conventional energy with solar energy to protect nature.  The governor conferred honorary doctorates on K Prakash Shetty, founder chairman of MRG Group; Thumbay Moideen, founder and president of Thumbay Group; and NRI businessman Ronald Colaco on the occasion. Minister for higher education MC Sudhakar, who is also the pro-chancellor of the university, spoke. Confusion, changes in proceedings There was confusion and chaos at the convocation, with the governor making a few changes to the proceedings. Normally, the national anthem is sung at the end of the convocation. However, the governor insisted on singing it at the beginning of the convocation, followed by the state anthem and the university anthem. Later, instead of handing over the PhD degrees individually to the candidates, the governor called them all onto the stage in batches for a group photo with the dignitaries. Furthermore, the convocation of the university never used to include a felicitation of the guests. However, the governor asked the authorities to felicitate the guests. "
214,India ranks 134 out of 193 nations in UNDPâs 2022 HDI,"NEW DELHI: India ranked at 134 on a list of 193 countries in 2022 as per the latest  Human Development Index , a notch higher than 135 out of 192 countries in 2021, attributed mainly to improvement across all HDI indicators over the previous year â increase in  life expectancy  from 67.2 to 67.7 years,  expected years of schooling  going up to 12.6 from 12 and per capita  Gross National Income  increasing from $6,542 to $6,951, among others. According to UNDPâs Human Development Report 2023-24, India showed progress in reducing gender inequality, ranking 108 out of 166 countries in  Gender Inequality Index  (GII), as compared with 122 out of 170 nations in 2021. With a GII value of 0.437 in 2022, India fared better than the global average of 0.462 and South Asian average of 0.478. GII measures gender inequalities in three key dimensions â reproductive health, empowerment, and labour market. On GII, the report states that Indiaâs performance in reproductive health is better than other countries in the medium human development group or  South Asia . India's adolescent birth rate in 2022 was 16.3 (births per 1,000 women aged 15-19), a marginal improvement from 17.1 in 2021. However, India showed one of the largest gender gaps in the labour force participation rateâ a 47.8% difference between women (28.3%) and men (76.1%). However, on the  Gender Development Index  (GDI), India continued to figure among Group 5 countries that have ranked low on eradicating the gap. GDI measures gender gaps on three dimensions - health that is measured by life expectancy at birth; schooling years for adults; and living standard. While life expectancy at birth for females was 69.4 years and that for males was 66.3 years in 2022, but when it came to mean years for schooling, it was 5.5 for females and 7.6 for males. The Gross National Income per capita for females stood at $2958 and for males at $10,696. âIndia has shown remarkable progress in human development over the years. Since 1990, life expectancy at birth has risen by 9.1 years; expected years of schooling have increased by 4.6 years, and mean years of schooling have grown by 3.8 years. India's GNI per capita has grown by approximately 287%,â said Ms.  Caitlin Wiesen , Resident Representative at UNDP India on the data on HDI. The report also showed that between 1990 and 2022, India saw its HDI value increase by 48.4% (from 0.434 to 0.644). India's loss in HDI due to inequality was measured at 31.1%. South Asiaâs loss in HDI due to inequality was among the highest in the world (after sub-Saharan Africa), followed by the Pacific. Nepal at 146 and Bhutan at 125 share space with India in âmedium human developmentâ category. Pakistan (164) and Afghanistan (182) figure in the low human development category. China at 75 and Sri Lanka at 78 figure in the âhigh human developmentâ category. The 2023-2024 HDR builds on 2021â2022 HDR findings, which saw the global HDI value fall for the first timeâtwo years in a row. Global HDI is projected to reach record high in 2023. However, this progress is uneven. It highlights with concern that after 20 years of convergence, the gap between the richest and poorest countries has started to widen from 2020."

This shift is attributed to a migration of individuals from the lowest income levels and a reduced share of top earners. The report highlighted that 36.3% of individuals who filed income tax returns in the lowest income group in FY14 have moved to higher income levels. This resulted in a 21.1% increase in income for these individuals from FY14 to FY21. The income disparity among those earning less than Rs 3.5 lakh has decreased from 31.8% to 15.8% during the same period, indicating a 16% rise in their share of total income relative to their population."

217,"G20 leaders stress well-calibrated fiscal, structural policies to promote growth, reduce inequalities","NEW DELHI: Concerned over cascading crises and challenges facing the global economy, the  G20 leaders  on Saturday underlined the need for well-calibrated  monetary , fiscal, financial and  structural  policies to promote growth, reduce inequalities and maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. The  G20  leaders want the central banks to remain strongly committed to achieving price stability in line with their respective mandates. ""They (central banks) will ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and will clearly communicate policy stances to help limit negative cross-country spillovers. Central bank independence is crucial to maintaining policy credibility,"" said the New Delhi Declaration adopted by the G20 leaders. The New Delhi Declaration adopted at the Summit of leaders of the world's top 20 economies held under India's presidency noted that cascading crises have posed challenges to long-term growth. Facing an uneven recovery and cognizant of the need to boost long-term growth, we will implement well-calibrated macroeconomic and structural policies. ""We will protect the vulnerable, through promoting equitable growth and enhancing macroeconomic and financial stability. Such an approach will help resolve the cost-of-living crisis and unlock strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth,"" the Declaration said. Global economic growth is below its long-run average and remains uneven. The uncertainty around the outlook remains high. With notable tightening in global financial conditions, which could worsen debt vulnerabilities, persistent inflation and geoeconomic tensions, the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside, it added. ""We, therefore, reiterate the need for well-calibrated monetary, fiscal, financial, and structural policies to promote growth, reduce inequalities and maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. We will continue to enhance macro policy cooperation and support the progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ""We reaffirm that achieving strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth (SSBIG) will require policymakers to stay agile and flexible in their policy response, as evidenced during the recent banking turbulence in a few advanced economies where expeditious action by relevant authorities helped to maintain financial stability and manage spillovers,"" the leaders said. The G20 also welcomed the initial steps taken by the  Financial Stability Board  (FSB), standard-setting bodies (SSBs) and certain jurisdictions to examine what lessons can be learned from this recent banking turbulence and encourage them to advance their ongoing work. The leaders emphasised that they will use macroprudential policies, where required, to safeguard against downside risks. The Declaration said: ""Central banks remain strongly committed to achieving price stability in line with their respective mandates. They will ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and will clearly communicate policy stances to help limit negative cross-country spillovers"". The declaration also stressed that central bank independence is crucial to maintaining policy credibility. ""We will prioritise temporary and targeted fiscal measures to protect the poor and the most vulnerable while maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. Ensuring the overall coherence of the monetary and fiscal stances remains important,"" it noted. The G20 Declaration recognised the importance of supply-side policies, especially policies that increase labour supply and enhance productivity to boost growth and alleviate price pressures. ""We reaffirm the April 2021 exchange rate commitment made by our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,"" it said. The leaders also recognised the critical role of private enterprises in accelerating growth and driving sustainable economic transformations. To this end, they resolved to work with the private sector to create inclusive, sustainable, and resilient global value chains, and support developing countries to move up the value chain and facilitate investments, including foreign direct investments (FDIs) towards sustainable business models. They also resolved to work with the private sector to devise pipelines of investible projects in developing countries by leveraging the expertise of MDBs (multilateral development banks) to mobilise investments and promote ease and reduce the cost of doing business. The declaration also recognised that startups and MSMEs are natural engines of growth."
218,"Reduce friction around ease of doing business, investment innovation to raise productivity: IMF chief economist","IMF Chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas is optimistic about Indiaâs growth prospects. In an interview to TOI, Gourinchas talks about a range of issues from raising  productivity  in India to bridging inequality through a billionaire tax and impact of  AI  on jobs. Excerpts India has been doing quite well. In FY 2023-24, growth was stronger than expected. The World Economic Outlook projection for this year is around 6.8%. India can continue to grow around 6.5% in the medium term. These are very, very solid growth numbers. It's much easier for a smaller country to generate high growth, but for an economy of Indiaâs size, it is pretty impressive. A number of things need to be done to grow at a much faster rate. There is a question of how quickly you can mobilise  labour inputs . If you want to grow faster, and you want it to be sustainable, you have to increase productivity. You cannot do it just by having more workers and more capital -- that gives you a shot in the arm, but it doesn't lead to sustained growth. To increase productivity, you have to reduce any frictions around the  ease of doing business , investing and innovating.  India has a relatively high growth rate, but it's starting at a fairly low per capita income compared to some other Asian economies. Another way to achieve higher productivity is improvements on the technology frontier. The hard way is to reinvent the wheel, which takes time. The other way is to learn as much as you can from foreign technology. External openness is very important as foreign direct investment ( FDI ) brings plant and technology. Third part of productivity improvement is skilling the labour force. India has a very skilled layer of workers, but it can do better. There are also reforms of the large domestic markets as it can be a good training ground for making sure that there is innovation and competition; that firms are not protected in a way that allows them to be inefficient; that there is enough competition domestically. Labour is another advantage for India because of the demographic dividend. A first order task is making sure the educational system, vocational training are at scale so that you can bring a lot of workers who are not in the labour force and you can reduce informality. Digitalization will also be helpful. Why do you have to choose? I understand you have a budget for doing various things, do you do production-linked incentives or something else. There is room for merchandise exports to grow as India is fairly low on that front. It is important to make sure that you have firms that are competing and are able to come down the cost curve. Here, the role of the domestic market is very important. China implemented an export oriented strategy but was in part driven by a very high level of competition in the domestic market, which to some extent was protected from abroad. Fierce competition between Chinese firms forced them to improve and become better and then engage in global markets. Integrating the Indian economy into a single market will be a huge benefit. On top of that, you can push exports of services by training a large number of skilled Indian workers in STEM, computer science. There's a bit of a false dichotomy. At the end of the day, productivity always creates jobs. Initially, you may for instance, think about improving productivity in the farming sector. It's very likely that productivity gains are going to release labour into other sectors of the economy. That's something that should be welcomed. The question is more about ensuring social safety nets and dealing with retraining, giving pathways to the young to get them jobs that have higher earning potential. An IMF paper talked about 33% of the workers in developed countries getting potentially displaced by AI and the number for developing countries was 24%. How serious is this threat of artificial intelligence? India is one of the countries we looked at using micro data. One dimension is exposure of jobs to AI, which is low. It reflects the high share of farming in employment. The second dimension is when you look at those that are exposed, the question is if AI is going to replace them or AI is going to enhance what they're doing? AI is not an opportunity for enough people in India, but for those who are exposed to AI, more of them are in the good category. To build on that you would want deployment of AI, development of AI and training as a lot of workers in that space can really benefit. This is pointing to opportunities. The danger is if AI moves faster than India getting ready to embrace it. At the IMF we endorse progressivity in the tax system, but excessive forms of taxation can be detrimental to capital accumulation or savings, which will impact growth. No society has full tolerance for any degree of inequality. We can have a certain amount of redistribution, which can be ex-ante or ex-post. From an economic principle, ex-ante is better, offering similar chances to people. There is a lot of evidence pointing that the tax systems globally have not been as fair and as equitable as they could be. In a globally integrated economy, there may be opportunities for some of the wealthier individuals or corporations to do tax optimization, allowing them a lower tax burden. There's been a big effort on the corporate side to harmonise capital income taxation and ensuring that corporations are unable to shop around by setting up shop in low tax jurisdictions. There is a parallel effort that is now starting at the G20 to think about something similar for the ultra-wealthy individuals, some sort of billionaire tax that can be harmonised. It is very preliminary. When you're looking at individuals, the implementation can be incredibly tricky. This is something that one must be careful about. There may be a situation where you have an enormous concentration of profits in the hands of a few and you have enormous competition on labour supply, and most of the workers are maintained close. UBI can contribute to this type of situation, which is a very extreme situation. We must look at the questions in detail. What is the effect of UBI on incentives to participate in the labour market? There may be a situation where a few will be working while others will be on some form of transfer payment. One has to be very careful when thinking about these things â there are questions of implementability and acceptability in terms of the social contract."
219,Explained: Why limiting Global Warming to 1.5 degree Celsius is crucial,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) emphasises that   is still within our control, despite a concerning rise of over 60% in pollutant emissions, primarily composed of CO2 from energy and industry since 1992. Recently, the WEF released a report indicating that government pledges alone will not suffice to achieve the  zero emissions  target. The Paris Agreement established a critical threshold,  limiting  global temperature change to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. This choice reflects a balance between mitigating  climate change  impacts and practicality. While lower temperature targets promise greater climate resilience, the 1.5-degree goal is considered ambitious yet attainable, reducing the risk of severe environmental and social consequences. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has identified over 400 milestones crucial for preventing global temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius. These targets emphasise the imperative role of  renewable sources  such as solar and wind in becoming the primary global energy sources for achieving zero emissions. Climate Stability: Keeping the  temperature rise  to 1.5 degrees Celsius helps maintain a more stable climate. Beyond this threshold, the risk of severe and irreversible impacts increases, such as more frequent and intense heat waves, storms, and other extreme weather events. Ecosystem Preservation : Many ecosystems are highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius reduces the risk of widespread ecosystem disruptions, helping to preserve biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and maintain vital ecological services. Sea Level Rise Mitigation: Warmer temperatures contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to rising sea levels. Limiting global temperature rise can help mitigate the extent of sea level rise, protecting coastal communities and low-lying areas from increased flooding and erosion. Food Security: Higher temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can negatively impact agriculture. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius helps in safeguarding  food security  by minimizing the risk of crop failures, disruptions in food production, and water scarcity. Human Health: Climate change is associated with various health risks, including heat-related illnesses, the spread of infectious diseases, and disruptions to food and water supplies. Keeping temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius can help mitigate these health risks and protect vulnerable populations. Social and Economic Stability: Unmitigated climate change can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. Limiting global temperature rise can contribute to the stability of societies by reducing the likelihood of climate-induced conflicts, displacement of communities, and economic disruptions."
220,Sunset walk: Delhiites push for a walkable city,"On  World Tourism Day , 40 Delhiites unleashed their inner explorers and hiked up to the Lal Kot, on the ruins of the ramparts of Qila Rai Pithora, in  Sanjay Van , to catch the glory of the golden hour.  Hiking on the rocky trails and wading through the bushes, the group first viewed the setting sun, followed by walking to another elevation to see the lit-up  Qutub Minar . Some made reels, some clicked selfies with Qutub in the backdrop and others sat silently on the rocks to enjoy the view. Everyone figured out a way to unwind post-office hours. The walk was organised by a cycling tour company, as a part of their  Public Mobility Project , aiming the community to come together and advocate for walkable and cycle-friendly cities.  Himanshu, the guide, explained, ""Sustainable and responsible tourism is not just about keeping mountains and beaches clean, but also about understanding your own city and recognising how fragile the ecosystems in the city are. With these free walking tours, we aim to advocate more walking for health and safety and a more pleasant urban environment,"" adding, ""Itâs not that people donât want to walk or cycleâitâs that the city is not that safe or enjoyable enough to make these activities appealing."" Delhi has over a 200km long cycling lane but they are not connected  Oneof the attendees, Peter Copping, from Canada, compared the situation in India to his home country, âIn Canada, we also love biking and camping, but we face challenges like disconnected cycle pathsâsimilar to what we see here in Delhi.â Another attendee Jaspreet Kaur, says, ""Be it within the city or to other cities, I love to travel. When I am not travelling on the weekends, I join these walks - to know the city better"" "
221,Green living in urban spaces: How sustainable architecture is reshaping cities to create healthier and greener living spaces,"Some of the most beautiful, aesthetic, and marvellous buildings, skyscrapers, monuments, tombs, temples, churches, and so many more establishments owe their creation to Architects! They are the genius minds and hands who bring together the most exquisite designs and shape the rural and urban skylines. And to honour their art and skill, every year on October 7, World Architecture Day is observed, and every year a new theme is set for architects around the globe. In 2024, the theme set by the International Union of Architects (UIA) is 'Empowering the next generation to participate in urban design'.  Each year, the UIA selects a theme that focuses on issues that the world is currently facing and then implements the theme to move forward in a more holistic and sustainable way. The objective of the day and its theme is to raise awareness about the role of architecture in shaping lives, encouraging innovative and socially responsible design, and supporting environmentally conscious urban planning. And so, on the occassion of World Architecture Day, we spoke to some leading architects to know their thoughts and ideas about  green living  in  urban spaces  and how architecture can help turn urban spaces from concrete jungles, to a more sustainable areas.  Across the globe, the rate of  urbanisation  is accelerating today. As our cities and towns become larger and denser, open,  green spaces  in urban areas are increasingly shrinking --from courtyards and balconies in single-family homes and offices to landscaped plazas and parks in neighbourhoods. A hypothesis put forward by noted American biologist Edward O. Wilson in 1984, states that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life, a phenomenon known as  biophilia . Our physical health and mental well-being are impacted by the presence of natural elements, or the lack thereof, in our living and working environmentsâwhether at home, in office, or schools. According to Rahul Kadri, Partner & Principal Architect at IMK Architects, ""The lack of such connections has been linked, in recent years, to adverse effects on our physiological and psychological well-being. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), for instance, is a health condition that is scientifically proven to afflict people living or working in poorly designed buildings --buildings with inadequate natural light and ventilation. It is essential for architects and planners, therefore, to design buildings and neighbourhoods in a way that closely integrates them with nature. Incorporating biophilic elements into the design of our urban spacesâ through green spaces, landscapes, and sustainable architectureâ does more than just beautify them. It offers a refuge from the concrete jungles that our cities are increasingly becoming and helps address our ecological responsibility. By putting green and blue spaces front and centre of our infrastructure investment, we also make our cities more resilient to crises, as they become more prevalent with climate change. We will finally be able to address that our cities are not just physically, but economically, socially and environmentally connected to their surrounding regions. By taking small, feasible steps in the short term, we can rebuild our social and economic fabric, and rebuild them for the better."" ""A thoughtful approach to urban development is essential in creating healthier, greener living spaces. Sustainable architecture and design shape cities in important ways, like looking closely at settlement trends and taking action to fix environmental problems before building anything new. Prioritising green areas, especially protecting trees with deep roots, is a key part of this approach. Stabilising the land, stopping soil loss, and refilling groundwater are all long-term benefits for the ecosystem's health. For instance, in one of our projects, we faced the challenge of adhering to a century-long drainage plan to avoid overburdening the existing network. To address this, deep water storage tanks were integrated into the design for each townhouse parcel, demonstrating how forward-thinking planning can prevent future strain on infrastructure. Another need in todayâs sustainable urban development is immediate attention to disaster mitigation strategies. Sustainable architecture and design shape cities in important ways, like looking closely at settlement trends and taking action to fix environmental problems before building anything new. Prioritising green areas, especially protecting trees with deep roots, is a key part of this approach. Stabilising the land, stopping soil loss, and refilling groundwater are all long-term benefits for the ecosystem's health. Disaster prevention methods are just as important for current sustainable urban growth. It's helpful to see how vernacular buildings have changed to fit different temperatures and landscapes. When we combine old techniques with new technology, we can make infrastructure that lasts and is good for the environment while also building urban places that honour the area's history. Modern imagination and traditional knowledge working together form the basis of green living. This allows for the creation of towns that are good for both people and the environment for many years to come."" says Harsh Varshneya, Principal Architect, STHAPATI ""In the face of rapid urbanisation, sustainable architecture has emerged as a cornerstone for healthier, greener cities. Design now transcends mere aesthetics and material choices, prioritising the creation of spaces that enhance livability and promote long-term environmental balance. Todayâs architects are revisiting traditional principles while embracing innovation, focusing on how their designs can respect and integrate with the surrounding context and communities. An important aspect is the contextual future-proofing of a project. When we build for tomorrow we must learn from the past and include those lessons in the present to build a better tomorrow. We often find what we are looking for is in the blueprints of the past. Many designers have also turned towards the use of local materials and passive cooling techniques with modern-day findings to create optimal design sensibilities. This hybrid approach creates mindful spaces that respect the site and its surroundings whilst catering to the ongoing challenges we face in and around the buildings we design. This respect for the surrounding ecosystem prioritises energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste reduction, all of which contribute to a more sustainable urban lifestyle. Equally crucial is the emphasis on using local materials and sensibilities. Sustainable architecture recognises that a buildingâs context is profoundly linked to the knowledge and traditions of the people inhabiting its surroundings. By engaging with the locals, we can design spaces that bring out the individuality of the land itâs built on whilst considering the siteâs environmental distinctions. This collaboration not only enhances architectural integrity but also promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility among its users, ensuring such sustainable and inclusive efforts benefit everybody and not just the users of our designs. Ultimately, this approach cultivates urban environments that are functional and long-lasting. By upholding the site and its communities, we create spaces that resonate with its users, fostering a sense of belonging and responsibility. With this cities can grow sustainably, ensuring that the future generations receive vibrant, livable communities that honour both their heritage and ecological balance."" says Jugal Mistri, Founder and Principal Architect, Jugal Mistri Architects ""Cities have paradoxically become both centers of social and ecological crises, while also serving as testing grounds for strategies to address these challenges. The future of building design and construction is undeniably greenâour ability to meet global climate goals depends on it. Green buildings are more efficient than traditional buildings, having the potential to drive up revenues and lower operational costs. Revisions to building codes and rating systems have raised tremendous awareness of the green agenda and have been instrumental in bringing up the minimum environmental standards of building design. Over the past two decades, performance of building envelopesâthe amount of heat, light, noise, entering or leaving, its repercussion on energy consumption, the kind of insulation neededâhave all become standard design elements that most of us are aware of. Even at the planning level, some advancement has been made in formulating masterplans integrated into a regional frameworkâa trend that needs to be further encouraged and more broadly adopted. These masterplans take into account not just local needs but also regional, environmental, social, and economic factors, aiming for a more holistic approach to urban development. In contrast, land development by private developers often remains a speculative exercise based on short-term gains and rapid project turnovers. These ventures prioritize immediate profit over long-term planning, which could be detrimental in the long run. At the urban level, more integrated developments that combine mixed-use functionsâresidential, commercial, and recreational spaces within the same areaâhave proven to be environmentally more successful by reducing the need for transportation, efficiently distributing infrastructure, and fostering more socially and culturally appropriate environments. And lastly, integration of green spaces within the urbanscape has marked a significant shift in urban planning and development. An important aspect is the transition towards a non-anthropocentric understanding of natural reserves that recognizes the ecological importance of such zones and forces a new understanding of human-nature connections."" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, Partner, team3 Delhi, the city of dreams for people from all over India, is constantly in news for rapid urbanisation, rampant use of unsustainable technologies, and an increasing blind eye towards ecological problems. But, some architects say that there still is some hope for the city and incorporating natural elements into the space isn't impossible!  As per Mitu Mathur, Director, GPM Architects and Planners said, "" In major Indian cities like Delhi, the accelerating urbanisation rates have accentuated the need to incorporate eco-friendly and green living principles into our landscapes. Sustainable architectural design and planning are pivotal in transforming urban environments into healthier spaces. This shift towards sustainability addresses the challenges of rapid urbanisation, environmental degradation, and climate change while enhancing the quality of life for urban populations. A fundamental principle of sustainable design involves integrating natural elements into building projects. Green pockets are no longer viewed as obstacles to development but as essential features that enrich the urban fabric. By preserving existing green spaces and incorporating them into architectural plans, we can enhance the city's overall livability. Green spaces that were once under threat of being overrun by the pressures of development are now recognised for their value in improving air quality, reducing urban heat islands, and forming natural oases within bustling urban centres.  Sustainable architecture drives cities toward energy efficiency with features like passive solar design, natural ventilation, and efficient insulation. Green roofs provide insulation and reduce the need for artificial heating and cooling while absorbing rainwater to prevent flooding. Additionally, urban farming practices allow residents to grow their food, creating a local, sustainable source of produce that reduces the need for transportation. These strategies reduce carbon footprints and lower utility and operational costs for inhabitants, making green living more accessible, financially viable, and self-sustaining.  However, green living also extends beyond building design to include sustainable transportation infrastructure encouraging walking, cycling, and public transport, significantly reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion while improving air quality. By prioritising green spaces, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation, sustainable architecture is transforming the way cities are designed and inhabited. Green living isn't merely a trend but the future of urban development, offering a path to resilient, eco-friendly cities."" ""Amidst the growing urbanisation and concrete jungles, human lives are faced with challenges related to lack of fresh air, congestion and absence of green spaces. Sustainable architecture is emerging as an answer, reshaping urban environments into healthier and greener living spaces. Designing with eco-friendly principles and incorporating methods that can improve user well-being through green practices form the base of this innovative approach. Vertical gardens, often making urban forests, are a popular method for enhancing air quality, cleansing the visual palette and improving overall aesthetics. These ingenious green walls transform the constrained spaces of an apartment building into a sustainable environment, where the walls invite butterflies and moths, increasing biodiversity. Provisions for sky gardens where the user can create a mini ecosystem on their own are also gaining importance. Drip irrigation can be used to improve the quality of life of plants and ensure their life throughout the year. Climbing plants can lower heat on walls and sunny windows while planting deciduous trees around dwellings offers shade and natural cooling. Green roofs act as insulation, maintain thermal comfort inside urban homes, and lower the need for artificial cooling systems, decreasing the carbon footprint by saving electricity.  While incorporating water as an element to create a microclimate, one thing that the designers have to be mindful of is the deterioration of groundwater. Reusing and recycling water while investing in water conservation techniques like rainwater harvesting helps in replenishing our dying resources. Smart irrigation systems ensure optimum water usage and reuse grey water from sinks for gardens after filtration, which helps maintain the greenery, but without the fear of collapse of the water table.  Green architecture not only involves the use of greenery and natural elements but also includes the use of sustainable materials like recycled wood, bamboo or mud. Choosing to style interiors using organic fabrics or buildings using sustainable techniques like rammed earth can go a long way in helping residents mitigate the catastrophes of living in an urban environment, says Vineeta Singhania Sharma, Founder Partner & Principal Architect, Confluence ""Can cities become living ecosystems that nourish both people and the planet? With urban centres expanding rapidly, the environmental toll is evident. Indian cities are grappling with a rapid decline in air quality and public health, driven by relentless urbanisation and unchecked development. Unmitigated natural disasters like flooding and torrential rains have made these problems worse, with disastrous results for communities all over the nation. The answer is a paradigm shift toward sustainable architecture, which emphasises environmental care while improving livability. Modern cities are embracing this shift through innovative design strategies aimed at minimising  environmental impact . Incorporating passive building techniques like optimising natural light and ventilation, reduce energy consumption significantly. Consciously designing with eco-friendly materials such as recycled concrete and low-carbon alternatives make an impact in reducing carbon footprint. The way that urban planners are integrating nature into cityscapes is drastically changing public areas. The proliferation of green roofs, vertical gardens, and urban farms mitigates the urban heat island effect, improves air quality, and enhances community well-being. Innovative stormwater management systems, such as bioswales and rain gardens, address the risks of flooding while filtering pollutants, demonstrating how sustainable design directly responds to the challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events.  Moreover, cities are becoming role models for resource efficiency. Rainwater harvesting technologies fight water scarcity in highly populated areas, and solar panels and wind turbines are used to collect renewable energy. As cities continue to grow, the move towards greener, smarter urban spaces is no longer optional but essential, as a necessary response to the climate crisis. Reimagining cities as ecosystems, enhances the quality of urban life and builds resilience for future generations."" says Bedanta Saikia â Vertical Head, Corporate Architecture, Science & Technology, Edifice Consultants "
222,Grassroots leaders emphasize community involvement at 'Commons Convening',"NEW DELHI:  Collective action  and  community involvement  are essential to understanding and managing  Commons , emphasized seven grassroots-level changemakers at the opening plenary of the âCommons Conveningâ held at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre in New Delhi on August 27. This three-day event brought together key stakeholdersâincluding government officials, civil society leaders, researchers, and community representativesâfrom over 20 states and Union Territories to address the critical challenges facing the governance of India's ecological Commons. Jishudan Dishari from Odisha, whose village Barakutni was awarded the Prakruti Mitra award in 2022, shared his personal journey towards protecting Commons. ""As a child, I learned from my grandmother that nature would save people. But growing up, I witnessed soil erosion and the degradation of our village forests, making me realize that now, people have to save nature,"" Dishari said. This realization led him to explore  conservation  techniques such as tree planting and improving irrigation systems to regenerate natural resources. Dishari now works with over 50 youths and 100 women from nearby villages and calls for broader societal participation in conserving Commons. He urged the convening to advocate for laws that empower communities and ensure that policies do not hinder conservation efforts. The opening plenary, which honored 'Changemakers for Commons,' highlighted community stewardship and set the tone for deep discussions, collaborative learning, and strategic planning. The discussions emphasized the importance of Commons in achieving the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development  and meeting climate action goals. Y. Nuklu Phom, from Yongyimchen village in Nagaland, shared his community's transition from hunting to wildlife conservation, which has resulted in the larger conservation of Amur falcons. ""Switching from shooting with guns to shooting with cameras was challenging, but it has made our forest corridors safer for the Amur falcons. Their arrival has bridged the gap between policymakers and community leaders,"" said Phom, a recipient of the Whitley Award for biodiversity conservation in 2021. Adding an urban perspective, Usha Rajagopalan, a lake activist from Bengaluru, emphasized that the concept of Commons is equally relevant in cities. ""Commons are not just for rural areas or forested regions; they are crucial in urban settings too. To prevent people from returning to villages and transforming them into cities, we need to make our cities more livable,"" Rajagopalan said. The event featured prominent speakers such as Rajesh S. Kumar, inspector general of Forests, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC); Muniraju S.B., Deputy Advisor, NITI Aayog; Sudarshan Iyengar, Chairperson, Foundation for Ecological Security; Ranjan Kumar Ghosh, Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; and Zeenat Niazi, Chief Advisor, Circular Economy and Climate Resilience Programs, Development Alternatives. Rajesh S. Kumar stressed the importance of institutionalizing Commons at the sub-national level, highlighting the need for collaboration between government and communities. ""To address the challenges facing Commons effectively, we need high-level convergence and collaborative actions. India has immense local wisdom at the panchayat level, and engaging at the sub-national level is key to protecting Commons,"" he said. The Commons Convening, co-organized by partners including Common Ground, Foundation for Ecological Security, Landstack, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS)-Mumbai, UNDP India, and Collaborating for Resilience (CoRe), seeks to elevate the significance of Commons in public discourse, promoting civic engagement and inspiring collective action. India's Commonsâcommunity forests, pastures, and water bodiesâspan over 205 million acres, accounting for a quarter of the country's landmass. These resources are crucial for the livelihoods of over 350 million rural poor, providing food, water, medicine, firewood, and timber, while also offering essential ecosystem services such as clean water, fertile soil, pollination, pest control, and carbon storage. The degradation of Indiaâs Commons and the traditional governance practices that sustain them highlight the urgent need for collective action. The convening aims to connect Commons management to broader issues like local self-governance, decentralization, food systems, rural incomes, freshwater ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, and the rural-urban continuum. It also seeks to explore the synergy between community governance (Samaaj), government (Sarkaar), and markets (Bazaar) to address systemic challenges. With at least 37 sessions planned, the event will cover themes such as area-based planning, community-led governance, womenâs leadership, coastal Commons management, and social accountability. These sessions, led by speakers from diverse backgrounds, will also explore enhancing the livelihoods of marginalized groups through the value addition of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and address the challenges and opportunities posed by the evolving dynamics of peri-urban areas. The Commons Convening seeks to create a platform for dialogue, collaboration, and collective action, fostering a shared understanding and vision for the future of Indiaâs Commons. It provides stakeholders with an opportunity to explore, connect, and coordinate initiatives that can lead to impactful and scalable solutions."
223,Hamburg Sustainability Conference brings the world together for new sustainability alliances,"HAMBURG (Germany): The first  Hamburg Sustainability Conference  (HSC) brings together politics, science and business as well as civil society and international organizations to develop solutions for the challenges of the times. Around 1600 participants from 102 countries discussed a wide scope of issues in more than 60 sessions: from sustainable  hydrogen supply chains  for  global shipping  to  fair raw material relations  for battery production and an  international financial architecture  that is fair for all. The aim of the conference was to develop concrete initiatives to accelerate the implementation of the  UN Sustainable Development Goals  jointly agreed by all countries of the world. The Hamburg Sustainability Conference was an initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Michael Otto Foundation and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. It will continue to take place in the coming years and thus initiate and support long-term change processes, stated the initiators of the conference.  The conference was opened by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Hamburg's First Mayor Peter Tschentscher as well as the Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Achim Steiner. Among others, the President of Namibia Nangolo Mbumba, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva, the Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley, heads of the state of nearly a dozen countries, Chadian civil rights activist and representative of the indigenous peoples Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim and Kenyan activist Mercy Mutana participated in the conference. The collaboration of representatives from politics, business, science and civil society from all parts of the world enables new alliances for concrete initiatives.  Development Minister Svenja Schulze said âThe principle of  international cooperation  is under enormous pressure worldwide. In many countries, nationalists advocate for isolation and stir up fears about the future. That the global community managed to adopt a pact for the future in September in New York under these circumstances is therefore a victory for  multilateralism . We want to build on this and develop concrete answers to questions about the future through new alliances. The major challenges of our time cannot be solved in a national shell but only through international cooperation. First Mayor of Hamburg Peter Tschentscher said âWith the international Sustainability Conference, Hamburg is making an important contribution to more sustainable global development. Our city itself is pursuing an ambitious SDG strategy. With Germany's largest seaport and around 100 consulates, we have excellent connections to all continents. We look forward to new concepts and new ideas for implementing the United Nations' SDGs.â UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said âComing on the heels of world leaders agreeing to the Pact of the Future on the margins of the UN General Assembly, the Hamburg Sustainability Conference is the first next step towards turning these global commitments into tangible action to steer our world to a more sustainable pathâ.  Michael Otto, Chairman of the Supervisory Board Otto Group said âThe major challenges of our time can only be addressed through close cooperation and a collaborative effort among politics, business, and society. The global consensus on the  Sustainable Development  Goals is, therefore, a significant achievement of multilateralism. However, these goals must be pursued with much greater urgencyâ.  Future issues including how shipping corridors can be created and supplied with green hydrogen so that it is possible to travel in a climate-neutral way. How can batteries, which are so important for climate protection, be produced using raw materials that are themselves sustainably sourced. How can the international financial architecture be reformed so that it can support all countries in sustainable development. How can the enormous potential of the private sector and civil society actors be better utilized to achieve the global goals for sustainable development for all and what guidelines can politicians set so that the sustainability pioneers of today set the standards of tomorrow and many more were discussed."
224,"Bengaluru landscapes turn more green, sustainable","Landscape architecture  in Bengaluru is witnessing a transformation. The extent of  green spaces  in gated communities is rising. There is a move towards more  native plants . Open spaces are being used creatively.  Sustainability practices  are becoming common. And with many Bengalureans secretly harbouring the dream of living in the countryside â drawn by its slower pace of life, connection with nature, and close-knit communities â some projects on the outskirts of the city are integrating  rural elements  into the metropolitan environment. Kannan Somasundaram, principal landscape architect at Design Milieu, says apartment landscapes used to be targeted towards providing as many amenities as possible to cater to all age groups and varied functional needs of the community. But today, he says, there is greater focus on greenery and sustainability. âAlong with function and aesthetics, environmental and ecological aspects are gaining more importance,â he says. Charulatha Rangarajan, principal architect and founder of Upasarg, says todayâs landscape designs provide for open outdoor spaces for individual activities like reading, listening to music, lounging gazebos, working pods (work from home/garden). They provide picnic spaces, with barbeque facilities, for small groups, and celebration spaces like amphitheatre and party lawns for larger groups.  âKnowledge gardens with open libraries also find place in the modern community garden,â she says. Radhika Bhat, design director in Earth Studio, says landscape design in apartments is seeing a rise in outdoor gyms, balcony planters and terrace level community spaces for recreation and exercise. Rohit Marol, founder of Terra Firma Landscape Architecture, also emphasises the role of landscape architecture in creating functional and aesthetically pleasing open spaces such as sit-outs, decks, pavilions, and water bodies including swimming pools. The inclusion of wooded areas, he says, enhances the aesthetics and functionality of the spaces. âLandscape architecture is not just about planting trees and cultivating gardens,â he says. And when you are planting gardens, itâs important to select the right plants. Some of the favourites include frangipani, various types of lilies, heliconias, ribbon grass, and anthuriums.  âThese plants thrive well in the cityâs climate and add vibrant colours to urban spaces,â Anjum Jung, principal architect and founder of Morph Design Company and executive director at Prestige Group, says. Plants such as aloe vera and snake leaf are advantageous for indoor environments due to their low maintenance and air-purifying capabilities.  The trend of incorporating indoor plants is growing as people look for ways to enhance their living spaces with minimal effort. Landscape architects are also increasingly incorporating sustainable practices into their projects. Sekar James, founder of Master Plan, has designed fully automated irrigation systems that provide bio nutrients, instead of chemicals. Prasad G, a principal architect at Dhruva Landscape Architect, uses treated sewage water for irrigation, he uses solar lighting, and local materials to minimise the carbon footprint. Prasad has worked on projects for corporate offices like those of SAP Labs and HCL in Bengaluru, besides numerous real estate projects. Some projects incorporate water bodies that aid in recharging groundwater and storing rainwater. âOne of our projects in Devanahalli and another on Old Madras Road feature ponds used for storing rainwater,â says Ajay Koshy, head of design and development at Brigade Group. Madhup Mazumdar, who was the executive landscape architect for the Kempegowda International Airportâs Terminal 2 and is currently working on the landscape design of a green IT park in Bengaluru and a number of premium housing estates in the city, says the trend of developing villa communities on the outskirts of the city, nestled within nature reserves, is gaining traction.  âThese âstay in the woodsâ projects offer a unique blend of wellness, forest living, and self-sustaining eco-living, providing an escape from urban life and a chance to connect with nature, appealing to those who wish to cut off from the urban hustle and immerse themselves in nature,â he says. Somasundaram of Design Milieu is currently overseeing a 15-acre project that includes a 3.5-acre space dedicated to a fruit orchard and an organic kitchen garden aimed at fostering  community involvement . âThe produce will be shared among all residents,â he says. The design also features a DIY (do-it-yourself) kitchen garden space specifically for children. Embassy Springs, a 288-acre township in Devanahalli, also exemplifies this trend. It features over 45 acres of open green spaces and seven large community parks. Tirupathi Rao Vaddi, chief finance officer at Inflow Technologies, lives in another similar project, Prestige Augusta Golf Village near Anagalapura. âI am the happiest when I am in my green paradise,â smiles Tirupathi. We would love to hear from you on landscape innovations your residential complexes have come up with. Please send your feedback to timescommunity@timesofindia.com. You could also share your favourite recipes and the stories behind them to the same email id, with your photographs."
225,Hyderabad runs high on freedom,"This  , Hyderabad was abuzz with series of  community-driven initiatives  that highlighted the cityâs commitment to  social causes  and  environmental sustainability . Residents from diverse neighbourhoods, including the IT corridor, Secunderabad, and Abids, gathered to make a meaningful impact through their collective action. One notable effort was led by  Ismaili Civic India  in partnership with the  Scouts and Guides of Secunderabad.  They spearheaded a  plantation drive  in Secunderabad, aiming to address the urgent challenge of  climate change  by enhancing green spaces and fostering environmental awareness.  In another initiative, the Karimabad Scouts and Guides organised a food donation drive at Niloufer Hospital, where meals were distributed to 150 patients. Iqbal Mandani, president of the Secunderabad Council, underscored the importance of these efforts: âIsmaili Civic is a pan-India initiative dedicated to driving societal change through impactful actions. Independence Day reminds us of our duty to confront the challenges our nation faces. Itâs a time to focus on our responsibility towards environmental conservation and social support.â Beyond the plantation drive, Ismaili Civic also coordinated blood donation camps across 22 cities in the country, showcasing their commitment to community service. Meanwhile, the Hyderabad Cycling Revolution (HCR) marked the day with a âFreedom Rideâ from Madhapur to T Hub, attract ing over 150 cyclists. This event aimed to promote active mobility as a solution to urban pollution. Ravi Sambari from HCR highlighted their mission: âOur initiative encourages people to walk for distances under one or two kilometres, use bicycles for trips up to five kilometres, and opt for public transport for longer journeys.  This approach not only reduces pollution but also promotes a healthier lifestyle.â"
226,Alliance on Green Shipping Corridors formed at HSC intending to build bridges,"HAMBURG: The  Hamburg Sustainability Conference  intends to build bridges between all those who are needed to solve complex problems â such as transforming and building a  sustainable shipping industry . The Alliance on  Green Shipping Corridors  formed at the HSC is an example for this collaborative effort.  Green shipping corridors that is routes on which it is possible to navigate climate neutrally, tank  renewable fuels , based on green hydrogen - can make a substantial contribution to achieving climate goals. The shipping industry is responsible for over 80% of CO2-emissions of global trade and emits more greenhouse gas than Germany as a whole - and it will continue to grow.  The new Alliance on  decarbonizing global shipping  can make a substantial contribution to achieving our climate goals by jointly establishing green shipping corridors. The vision is to establish green shipping routes on which it is possible to tank or store renewable fuel that has been produced in a climate-neutral way.  This is a global challenge that can only be solved through international cooperation by a variety of actors that need to be on board: fuel producers, companies that can transport these new fuels, ports that offer the renewable fuels, shipping companies that buy them, ship builders that build in motors able to run with the new fuels, banks that support financing the needed investments and governments that provide the necessary environment for it.  Development cooperation can and will contribute to the solution: The German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development can point to a long tradition of very good cooperation, especially with countries that are regarded as the frontrunners in the production of green, sustainable fuels.  Development cooperation can thus function as a door opener for economic cooperation and sustainable development. In many of these partner countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, the conditions for producing renewable electricity are excellent. There is a special need for many of these countries to become key players in the rapidly growing global market for green hydrogen products. In addition, it is the chance for these countries to simultaneously advance their own energy transition, their local energy supply and domestic industry. For this to happen it is of particular importance to make the global hydrogen market a fairer and more equitable one than the fossil fuel world ever was. This means that from the outset other aspects of sustainable development have to be taken into consideration and be integrated into the new Green Shipping Corridors, such as ensuring that the local population also gets an affordable access to the new clean energy that is being used for hydrogen production, ensuring decent working conditions on hydrogen producing plants and safeguard the sustainable development of cities and communities around the new production sights. If done right, all actors along the value chain can profit from the great coordination effort for a global hydrogen ramp up: production countries in the Global South through development created by new hydrogen value chains, Germany and other European countries through stable and diversified supply relationships and businesses via chances for exporting hydrogen technology."
227,Sri City launches resources exchange platform-Score,"VIJAYAWADA:  Sri City , a leading industrial hub in the country, has taken a significant step towards  sustainable development  with the launch of its innovative SCORE (Sri City Online Resource Exchange) Portal. This web-based platform, unveiled on Tuesday, aims to advance  circular economy  practices within the industrial ecosystem. The virtual launch event was attended by environment managers and senior supply chain executives from various industrial units. Sudhakar G Reddy, Sustainability Expert from the University of Michigan, USA, was the Chief Guest. Mr Satish Kamat, President (Operations), presided over the ceremony.  P Venkateswaran, General Manager (Environment), explained that SCORE will establish an online network for resource sharing, provide material information, and support data analysis for environmental and economic impact. Sudhakar Reddy briefly spoke on the initiatives and operational schemes of waste minimisation and sustainability across the campus at the University of Michigan, we have all emerged from the concept âR3â - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. He appreciated Sri Cityâs initiative in launching the very useful portal. Ravindra Sannareddy, Founder Managing Director of Sri City, emphasised the portal's significance, stating, ""Sri City's zero-waste initiatives, exemplified by the  SCORE Portal , underscore its leadership in sustainability and set a benchmark for other industrial zones."" As a vital component of Sri City's zero-waste strategy, the SCORE Portal will serve as an information network for listing and exchanging unused or excess materials. This initiative aims to address the common challenge of accumulating surplus materials faced by many companies, promoting a culture of reduce, reuse, and recycle among the industrial community. The portal will facilitate connections between companies with excess resources and those in need, optimising resource utilisation and minimising waste.

228,Membersâ camaraderie makes PNBCA Durga Puja memorable year on year,"Nagpur: The   organised by the Paschim Nagariya Bengali Cultural Association ( PNBCA ) at Ladies Club Lawn, in Civil Lines, stands out in city year after year, thanks to the deep sense of  community bonding  among its members. With just 44 members coming together like a close-knit family, the celebration is more than just a religious event â it's a testament to their shared commitment, camaraderie, and passion for maintaining their  cultural heritage . Patron Harishankar Dutta proudly describes PNBCA as âone big family', where the primary aim has always been to ensure that every member feels welcome, engaged, and comfortable during the five days of festivities, fostering a sense of belonging. President Abhik Palit emphasizes that this spirit of community is at the heart of PNBCA's celebrations. ""We place great value on bonding. That's why all events are organised and performed by our own members,"" he notes.  ""From managing finances and overseeing pandal operations to coordinating mahaprasad distribution and staging evening cultural events, every aspect of the celebration is handled meticulously by dedicated members, reinforcing a true spirit of togetherness and collective effort, said general secretary Somshubhra Sarkar and treasurer Gautam Sanyal in one voice. This year's festivities, now in their 11th edition, reflect this collaborative spirit even more vividly. On Maha Saptami, members captivated the audience with a lively and well-received drama performance, and on Maha Nabami, they honoured the late music icon Bappi Lahiri with a special musical tribute, blending his classic hits with contemporary songs, much to the delight of attendees. Inaugurated on October 8 by DCP (traffic) Archit Chandak and his wife Saumya Sharma Chandak, CEO of Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited, the vibrant celebration will culminate on Dussehra, leaving behind lasting memories of unity, joy, and the enduring spirit of togetherness for the entire PNBCA family."
229,Bengaluruâs vanishing tree cover has cityâs Gen Z on edge,"When her parents moved to Bengaluru, Pranavi Maruvada was just 10 years old. But she remembers vividly that the city then was evergreen and cool all day.  Seventeen years since, Pranavi knows it in her bones that the city doesnât feel the same anymore. âThe lush green canopies I took for granted are now glimpses that bring nostalgia. The famed weather has changed, and itâs gut wrenching,â says Pranavi, who holds a postgraduate degree in dermatology. She admits sheâs worried about  climate change . âClimate anxiety is a thing because itâs real,â she says. Environmental sustainability  continues to be among the top priorities of  Gen Z  and millennials, says a survey that Deloitte did earlier this year.  âSix in 10 Gen Zs (62%) and millennials (59%) say they have felt worried or anxious about climate change, up two points for both generations from 2023,â the report says. Itâs concerning that sometimes when thereâs no need to develop, thereâs a constant push to develop, says Varada Vivek, a 20-year-old undergraduate law student. âSo, for that reason, cutting down trees without replacing them in the same locality, is not justified. Itâs not correct,â she says. Echoing Varadaâs words, Namma Bengaluru Foundation general manager and environmentalist Vinod Jacob says the  BBMP Forest Dept  must ensure  compensatory afforestation  is done within 5km radius of where the tree is cut.  âYou cannot compensate for the trees cut in Bengaluru by planting saplings in Kolar. Even if the law lets you do it anywhere in Karnataka, it wonât help increase the cityâs green cover,â says Vinod.  It is stipulated that compensatory afforestation must be done at a ratio of 1:10, which means for each tree cut, ten saplings are to be planted. If you ask BBMP Forest Dept officers, they would say it is a struggle to find enough space to carry out compensatory afforestation within the city.  âThis year we have plans to plant 2 lakh saplings, of which we canât find space for 50,000. When it comes to compensatory afforestation, you need to find space for 10 saplings in place of each tree, and thatâs not easy,â says B L G Swamy, deputy conservator of forests.  The BBMP forest dept gets a host of requests to fell trees â for being dangerous, to widen roads, build metro or rail tracks. All the eight zones under the department are managed by just 15 officers. âThe temperature of a region depends on solar energy, and if there are entities like vegetation or water body, it acts as a heat sink because it absorbs heat,â says Professor T V Ramachandra of IISc, explaining how trees play an important role in regulating the microclimate of a region.  When the vegetation cover was good in 1992, the temperature in the city was 21Â°C, but it kept increasing as the city gradually lost its green cover â it became 24Â°C in 2000, and 28Â°C in 2010.  âAnd today, itâs 36 to 39 degrees Celsius. Still, it is not too late. Even if you wake up today, we can have the corrective measures,â he adds. Professor Rao suggests a solution to the land-starved govt. âWhen you acquire land for a road project, acquire slightly more than what is required, so that when you are clearing the trees on the side you can do the replantation (there itself) as it is done in China and other countries.â Twenty-year-old Myrah, a design student, thinks that the way we are debating climate change should improve.  âEven when you just consider the fact that thereâs a lot more dust in the air, the entire environment is changing, and thereâs a lot more pollutants, thereâs absolutely nothing thatâs being done to improve it.â She thinks thatâs because the ongoing conversations are not designed well. âWhen schools talk about climate change, itâs seen as an educational topic, but not something that theyâre invested in.â Myrah firmly believes that patchwork solutioning, like electric cars, is not going to undo any of the damage. âBut at the same time, I donât think even planting trees is something thatâll do us much good. The only thing that can truly save us is building entire ecosystems.â College-goer Deeksha PK says despite climate change affecting millions round the year, there is not much being done to stop its progress.  âIt is creating anxiety among many, especially the farming community, as the climate has become extreme and unpredictable.â She adds that though social media has helped in bringing in more awareness on the topic, it has also built up a lot of anxiety on the same.  Deeksha suggests that one must start acting at some point, and may as well start with a small step of planting trees in the locality one lives in. Sometimes it can be scary to think about what our world would look like in the next few decades, says Shreya G A, a 20 year old PR trainee.  âSocial media undoubtedly creates a community and amplifies the message. However, I have observed that social media can leave one feeling overwhelmed, adding to the anxiety and despair. Another problem is the lack of verified information. It only makes it harder to understand better,â she says. Pranav Sajiv, an engineering student, believes that  climate anxiety  is caused by genuine reasons and the adverse changes itâs already causing.  âPeople have finally started taking notice of the rapidly increasing temperature of our summers and the fluctuations in rain timings, and are valid for developing anxious sentiments towards our planetâs wellbeing and humanityâs future,â says the 18-year-old. In a first, BBMP has begun to count the number of trees in the city. DCF Swamy is confident that the data will be ready in another six months.  âWe are estimating it for the first time. It was supposed to be done seven years ago.â  Tree counting  has been completed in at least ten wards so far. Prof Rao says, while studying satellite data, it was observed that there has been a continuous degradation in the cityâs tree cover."
230,"Samsung, IIT-D support student community & env solutions","NEW DELHI: Korean electronics giant   gave out funds and support to school and college innovators in the field of  community development  and environment and sustainability, as part of a global programme which is run across 63 countries.  The third edition of â Solve for Tomorrow  2024â national education and innovation competition saw participants present various solutions across categories with experts from Samsung, Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer (FITT) and  IIT-Delhi  working closely with the top 10 teams, mentoring them as they developed solutions for real-world challenges. ââ¦ we aim to empower young minds by providing them with the tools, mentorship and opportunities they need to address some of the most pressing challenges in their communities and the environment. (and) look forward to seeing the ideas of these young innovators come to life,â Samsung Southwest Asia president and CEO JB Park said. Samsung said that the students submitted ideas under two themes: âCommunity and Inclusionâ and âEnvironment and Sustainabilityâ. âmost of the ideas focused on tackling key issues such as education and resource access for less privileged communities, challenges in experiential learning, digital literacy, water conservation and arsenic pollution,â the company said, adding that mentorship helps the students refine their ideas and create functional prototypes.

METAL, from Udupi in Karnataka, developed technology for arsenic removal from ground water, and received a grant of Rs 50 lakh for incubation at IIT-Delhi. Park and United Nations Resident Coordinator in India Shombi Sharp were present as the students were awarded. Samsung said that the event saw participants from schools and colleges across India, many of whom came from Tier 2 and 3 cities and remote regions. First launched in the US in 2010, the âSolve for Tomorrowâ programme is now active in 63 countries and has engaged over 2.3 million young innovators globally. "
231,"Processions, decorations, community services mark Eid-e-Milad-un Nabi","Indore: Several sections of the Muslim community in  Indore  observed  Eid-e-Milad-un Nabi , marking the birth of  Prophet Muhammad  (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam), with great fervour on Monday.  Since early morning, many areas have been bustling with processions and homes were illuminated with decorative lights and other decorations. People across the city participating in various events and streets were adorned with flags and banners honouring the Prophet. Areas particlulary, Khajrana, Badwali Chowki, Juna Risala, Chandan Nagar, Azad Nagar, Bombay Bazaar, Ranipura, and Gulzar Colony were lively since morning. Thousands of people holding flags took part in processions. Sweets and traditional halwa were distributed, and different programmes were held throughout the day to mark the occasion. Mosques were beautifully decorated, and community members came together to commemorate the life and teachings of Prophet Muhammad.

232,Love me twice: How 'thrift' culture is reshaping Bengaluru's fashion scene,"At age 6, Mridula Pai would hit the expat garage sales with her mother. Four decades on, Pai still fondly remembers many of her purchases, including a pair of enamel earrings. âThe memory attached to a pre-owned item is precious. Thereâs a beauty to acquiring something knowing that it was loved by someone before,â she says. Itâs no surprise then that Pai, now 46 and a former marketing and communications consultant, set up a  thrift store  suitably named Love Me Twice (LMT). With its roots in Kolkata, LMT, which has a shop-in-shop at The Paper Boat Collective in Indiranagar, today has a strong presence in Bengaluru. Paiâs grand plan is to change the perception of thrift. âOne way is to make it a pleasant and enjoyable experience,â she says. Thereâs a new thrift store almost every other day on Instagram, and everyone seems to be wearing vintage, championing pre-loved, or busy reloving and rehoming. But all is not well in the world of fashion resale. In October last year, Poshmark India â the Indian arm of the California-headquartered social e-commerce marketplace â announced that it is closing its India business. In June this year, South Asian ethnic wear resale platform Saritoria, founded by London-based entrepreneur Shehlina Soomro, announced its India exit.  Kishco CEO Nohar Nath is not surprised by the trend. He started his  pre-owned clothing  website Kiabza in 2020. At the time of the lockdown, the company, which procured branded second-hand clothes from various sources on a consignment basis, used to get an average of 800 products a month. Post April 15, 2020, it shot up to 1,400.  In 2023, Nath called a halt to the business despite the âgood numbersâ. âIt canât be denied that thereâs still a massive amount of excitement around fashion resale and most of it fuelled by the demand driven by Gen Z. But itâs a business that has not been able to scale,â he says. This is a potent reason why this sector is now going local. The hyperlocalised narratives in thrifting fi nd a new lease of life via social media platforms, with Instagram being the real playground for thrifters. âYet, the charm of physical stores cannot be de nied.  Increasing the availability of high-quality, well-curated thrift stores can help convince the hesitant ones to try it out,â says Sahar Mansoor, founder and CEO of Bengaluru-based Bare Necessities, a  social enterprise  that produces zero-waste products. An avid thrifter, Mansoor says, âBengalureans have always been very open to trying new concepts and ideas, making it the ideal place for entrepreneurs and creators.â The cityâs support for startups, its elevated levels of eco-consciousness and the drive to search for sustainable alternatives have resulted in the birth of many offl ine thrift stores and boutiques in recent years. Meghna Khanna, 46, shut down her Indiranagar-based store Levitate in 2020 and joined the Ulsoor-headquartered The Preloved Co, a charity-based startup founded by health coach Mariam Begg. She swears by the circular fashion traditions in India.  âWe have been exchanging clothes for utensils and wearing hand-me-downs from our mothers and cousins and elder sisters for years. With the rise of nuclear families, the circularity was affected. But now, women are at the forefront of thrift culture. A woman today needs an extensive wardrobe to assume multiple roles, whether itâs for a board meeting on a Monday, or a Friday night out with the girls,â she says. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that the fashion industry accounts for 2% to 8% of global carbon emissions. That fashion has a sustainability issue is self-evident. Fashion resale, on the other hand, has a profi t problem.  To counter this, Khanna started focusing on vibrant curations, themed displays and building narratives leveraging Instagram. âPre-Covid, it was diffi cult to get people to part with their old clothes but post-Covid, people are starting to realise that feeling lighter (in their closets) made them feel better,â she says. If  clothing donations  are anything to go by, thrift is the way to go. Devyani should know. The 48-year-old started Re-store â a thrift shop in Whitefi eld selling âgently-used goodsâ â eight years ago after a heavy rainfall affected the neighbouring hutmills. She called for a donation drive for clothes and received enough to fi ll a two-storey store.  She set up a small place with a âbuy at whatever priceâ model and purposely chose a semi-rural area. She now has an Instagram page that helps supplement her charity work. âToday, we get orders from Udupi, Indore, Hubballi and Mysuru among other tier-2 cities,â she says. Though she admits that the stigma attached to  secondhand goods  still very much exists. âCelebrity endorsements, visiting college campuses, pop-ups, swaps, collaborations etc.  help make thrifting appear more trendy. It needs to gain social media currency,â she says. Pai chimes in: âIn order to normalise thrifting, stores really need to level up with other brands in the market.â For Prerna Ponnappa, shifting her brand Thrift Therapy â which used to operate from Beneath The Mango Tree in Benson Town â to online channels earlier this year made operations smoother.  The brand helps supplement funds for her charities for girlsâ education and the welfare of community dogs. She now liaises with 6 clutter free groups on WhatsApp, 3 times a week. âYoungsters have a different mindset. They are more comfortable shopping online,â she says. Twenty-seven-year-old Maya KV, a public policy graduate, turned to thrifting after she came across a few eco-conscious people on Instagram. âHaving worn hand-me-downs from my cousins since my teenage years, the idea of preloved has always been familiar to me,â she says, adding that she knows many who are, on the other hand, uncomfortable with the idea of buying âusedâ clothing.  Alena Warrior, a 26-year-old marketing and brand strategy professional in the F&B sector, shifted to thrifting primarily because of sizing issues. âAs someone whoâs not on the skinny side, I fi nd it easier to spot fashionable clothes when I thrift, both online and offl ine. The thrift shops are more versatile in terms of the size range,â she says. Prithvi Rao, one of the founders of now defunct wardrobe swap venture Exchange Room, says sheâs happy thrifting is thriving now, compared to a decade ago when she started the offl ine event. âWe always believed that if you treat pre-loved clothes with the respect they deserve, you can achieve fi rst-hand experience,â she says. â The apparel industry churns out 100 to 150 billion items annually; production has doubled in the past two decades. Of this, only 1% actually gets recycled and 85% is discarded â The industry generates 100 million tonnes of waste every year, predicted to rise by at least 50% before 2030 â Globally, resale industry is growing at 5x the rate of overall commerce. Expected to reach $250 billion by 2027 â The secondhand market is driven by young GenZ consumers, who favour brands that offer pre-loved items in addition to new products"

235,9 car-free cities around the world in 2024; check out the list,"Yesterday, the world celebrated International Car-Free Day, encouraging people globally to forgo cars for a day. By 2024, the number of cars is projected to reach 1.475 billionâequating to one car for every 5.5 people, or 182 cars per 1,000 individuals. While this figure might seem large, the environmental impact is significant: a typical passenger vehicle emits around 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. When multiplied by 1.475 billion cars, the consequences become alarming.  Car-free cities  aim to reduce traffic congestion, lower pollution levels, and enhance overall quality of life. This movement promotes healthier transportation alternatives, such as cycling, walking, and public transit. Discover the various countries that have embraced this change. Car-Free Day is an annual event celebrated in many cities around the world to promote sustainable transportation and raise awareness about the environmental impacts of car use. On this day, local authorities often encourage residents to give up their cars for various modes of transport, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. The initiative aims to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and noise, while also promoting healthier lifestyles and community engagement. Car-Free Day typically features activities like street fairs, cycling events, and educational programs to inspire long-term changes in transportation habits. It's part of a broader movement to create more livable and sustainable urban environments. Nestled at the foot of the iconic Matterhorn, Zermatt has been a car-free haven for as long as anyone can remember. Access for private vehicles is permitted only until TÃ¤sch, located 5 kilometres away. From TÃ¤sch, visitors can switch to a shuttle train that runs every 20 minutes to reach Zermatt. Once in the town, transportation options include walking, horse-drawn carriages, eTaxis, bicycles, and a free eBus that operates two routes: the skibus and the Winkelmatten bus. La Digue, a tranquil island in the Seychelles, is a place where time seems to stand still. With no traffic jams or honking horns, the best way to explore is by bike. The island's main road offers scenic views and leads to the stunning Anse Source d'Argent, one of the worldâs most photographed beaches. Visitors can also trek to Anse Coco, snorkel, or kayak in clear waters. For those with limited mobility, electric buggies are available to help navigate the island. Venice's Centro Storico is renowned as Europeâs largest pedestrian-only urban area. Built on a network of 126 islands, the city features over 400 bridges connecting various districts. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Venice attracts around 20 million tourists each year, all while remaining vehicle-free. In fact, locals have even considered banning rolling suitcases to maintain their peaceful, wheel-free environment. Lamu, home to one of the oldest Swahili towns, has outlawed cars entirely. Instead, donkeys provide land transport, while traditional dhows ferry visitors around the archipelago. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lamu boasts a rich history and features stunning architecture made from coral stone and mangrove timber. The Old Townâs narrow streets and intricately designed buildings reflect a unique blend of Swahili, Arabic, Persian, Indian, and European influences. Fes el Bali, the larger of Fesâs two medinas, is a remarkably preserved mediaeval city with over 13,000 historic structures. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981, it is likely the largest contiguous car-free area in the world. With some streets as narrow as 24 inches, the area is largely inaccessible to vehicles, making it a truly unique destination for visitors. Since 2017, the city centre of Ghent has been car-free, enhancing its mediaeval charm. The city offers a free park-and-ride shuttle, along with regular bus routes, tram lines, and even an electric boat service for eco-friendly mobility. Night buses and free transport for children under 14 further enhance the appeal of public transport in this vibrant university town. On the picturesque island of Hydra, cars and even bicycles are banned. The only way to navigate its charming alleys is on foot or via the islandâs trusty mules. While mules may be slow, they provide a unique way to explore the island. Boats are the preferred mode of transportation to reach the more remote beaches.\ Located just 75 miles from Amsterdam, Giethoorn is a postcard-perfect village without cars or paved roads. Known as the Dutch Venice, visitors can traverse the area by bike, boat, or foot over the many footbridges crossing its serene canals. The town's name, which means ""goat horn,"" originates from the discovery of wild-goat horns by early settlers. Yelapa, a charming cove located in the Bay of Banderas, is completely car-free. Although a road leads to the outskirts, travel to and from the village is primarily by boat. In the 1960s and 70s, Yelapa became a haven for hippies, and today its laid-back vibe continues to attract visitors seeking a peaceful escape.

If you are looking to celebrate the festival in an  eco-friendly  way, here are some tips.  There's nothing like the charm of traditional  clay idols . You can also make one at home or opt for Ganpati idols made from  papier-mÃ¢chÃ© .  Tree Ganesha idols  are also a good option. These idols have seeds inside that grow into plants after immersion.  Ditch the plastic and synthetic decorations this year. Get creative with natural items like flowers, leaves, and jute. You can also make your own decor using recycled paper, cloth flowers etc. Instead of synthetic colours, use natural materials like rice flour, turmeric, flower petals, and seeds to create your designs. These materials are biodegradable and the seeds can also serve as food for insects or birds later. Consider purchasing your idols, decorations, and festival supplies from local artisans and vendors. It supports the local economy and reduces the carbon footprint associated with mass-produced, imported goods. You can also organise or participate in community events such as tree planting drives, clean-up initiatives, or recycling workshops during the festival."
237,Teen taken into custody after five family members shot dead in Washington home,"A teenager was taken into custody following a deadly shooting that left five people dead inside a home southeast of Seattle on Monday morning, according to officials. The shooting occurred in  Fall City , Washington, and multiple 911 calls were made around 5 am,  King County Sheriffâs Office  spokesperson Mike Mellis confirmed during a media briefing. Deputies arrived at the scene and immediately detained a teen, while another teenager, who had sustained injuries, was transported to a Seattle hospital. Both teens reportedly lived in the home, Mellis said. Upon entering the residence, deputies discovered the bodies of five victimsâtwo adults and three young teenagers. Authorities have not yet released the names of the deceased. ""Once bodies were discovered, clearly we understand that this is a hugely significant crime scene,"" Mellis said. While the shooting appears to involve family members, officials have not determined how the victims and the teens are related. Mellis reassured the community that there is no ongoing threat. âI have no reason to think that there will be any additional arrests,â he added. A neighbor, Lynne Trowern, told KING-TV that a couple and their five children lived in the house, expressing her shock and grief: ""Iâm just in total shock, I keep bursting into tears."" The teen suspect is being held at King Countyâs  juvenile detention  facility and is expected to make a court appearance on Tuesday or Wednesday, according to the county Prosecuting Attorneyâs Office."
238,NGO objects to proposed hoardings facing Coastal Road in Mumbai,"MUMBAI:  NGO NAGAR  has written to the  BMC  to reconsider its proposal for allowing  hoardings  along the open space facing the  Coastal Road  running from  Marine Drive  to Worli. While the civic body has said that none of the hoardings are coming up on reclaimed land, the plans are for setting up hoardings along the open spaces which have existed prior to the coming up of the Coastal Road. The NGO, in its letter, has pointed out the latest BMC Draft Policy Guidelines for Display of Outdoor Advertisement 2024, which states, ""No hoardings shall be permitted in the compulsory open spaces required to be maintained under the  Development Control Regulations  of Greater Mumbai (DCR) including public recreation grounds, playgrounds, parks and gardens."" Further, they have mentioned that the two garden spaces where the hoardings are proposed, namely  Tata Garden , designated as an Existing Open Space (EOS 2.6 Recreation Ground), and Haji Ali Garden, also marked as an Existing Open Space (EOS 1.5 Garden) in the Development Plan, are vital  public amenities  that should not be exploited for commercial gain. âAdditionally, the area along the coastal road is intended to serve as a green public space, protected from commercial activities. The placement of hoardings in the open spaces not only violates the guidelines regarding hoarding placements, but the installation of hoardings along the Coastal Road contradicts the vision of  sustainable  and  environmentally friendly  open spaces for the community. We urge BMC to reconsider this decision that gravely affects the open spaces, safety, and ecology of our city,â states the letter signed by trustees Nayana Kathpalia and Meher Rafat."

240,Private investment showing encouraging signs on festive boost: RBI Bulletin,"Private investment  is showing encouraging signs on the back of rising business optimism and a pick up in  consumption demand  during the ongoing festival season, according to the Reserve Bank's October Bulletin released on Monday. In India, the aggregate demand is poised to shrug off the temporary slowdown in momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25 as festival demand picks up pace and consumer confidence improves, the article on the 'State of the Economy' published in the Bulletin said. Further, rural demand is expected to get a boost from the improved  agricultural outlook . Private investment should pick up steam in response to signs of a pick-up in consumption demand and rising business optimism.  In India, aggregate demand is poised to shrug off the temporary slowdown in momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25 as festival demand picks up pace and consumer confidence improves.  The rural demand is expected to get a boost from the improved agricultural outlook.  ""Private investment should pick up steam in response to signs of pick up in consumption demand and rising business optimism,"" the article said.  With the financial sector ready to intermediate resources for productive investment, buffered by healthy balance sheets, and the government's continued thrust on capex, the investment outlook appears bright.  The article authored by a team led by RBI deputy governor Michael Debabrata Patra said the global economy remained resilient in the first half of 2024, with declining inflation supporting household spending.  Stable growth momentum amidst monetary policy easing is becoming the prevailing theme across most economies.  ""In spite of geopolitical tensions, India's growth outlook is supported by robust domestic engines,"" it said.  Some high-frequency indicators have, however, shown a slackening of momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25, partly attributable to idiosyncratic factors like unusually heavy rains in August and September.  ""Looking ahead, private investment is showing some encouraging signs in terms of lead indicators while consumption spending is shaping up for a festival season revival,"" the authors said.  The article further said recent data suggest that credit card transaction volumes have slowed as lenders are adopting caution in view of risks flagged in unsecured loans.  Incipient stress in the microfinance sector appears to have been driven by lenders' drive to disburse loans rather than borrowers' demand.  The self-regulatory organisation - Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN) - points to guardrails to mitigate asset quality challenges, such as capping a borrower's loan repayment obligations at 50 per cent of the household's income, limiting the number of microfinance lenders and capping total indebtedness.  Credit bureau data, the article said, indicate that retail credit growth has moderated as lenders have tightened personal loan supply.  It also noted that in the banking space, deposit rates are expected to stay elevated despite some slowing down of credit growth.  The article also said digital payment transactions are expected to gain from strong tailwinds with the onset of the  festive season , marked by mega e-commerce sales and rising demand from smaller towns and cities.  Increasingly, consumers in Tier 3 to 6 cities are using digital payment services daily.  ""These developments highlight the vast potential for driving adoption and ensuring sustained usage of digital payments at the grassroots level,"" it said.  Further, the article noted that liquidity conditions remain in surplus mode.  The Reserve Bank, it said, will continue to be nimble and flexible in its liquidity management operations and deploy an appropriate mix of instruments to modulate both frictional and durable liquidity to ensure that interest rates evolve in an orderly manner.  The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India."
241,UP lens on booze data to net more revenue,"Lucknow: Nearly 8.5 crore liquor bottles, packs and units were consumed in UP in a month with about 90% of the demand for country liquor, beer and IMFL being met through production units within the state. Home to 182 sugar mills, 88 distilleries and seven breweries, the molasses and grain-based alcohol and brew produced through these production units were carried forward to the retail market through close to 800 wholesale godowns or bonds. Having implemented an integrated excise supply chain management system, the department sat on a goldmine of data. With the demand and supply scenario touching the saturation point, the department explored various options on the table to increase its revenue.  Chasing a target of Rs 50,000 crore for the 2024-25 financial year, during the first half, the department was able to generate Rs 22,563 crore (between Apr 1 and Sept 30) as excise duty over  liquor sales . Caught in a paradox, a senior excise department officer said raising the bar further was not possible without finding new avenues. ""Promoting increased consumption of liquor among the youths inorganically is not a good idea. We must promote responsible drinking in society. Plus, we feel the elasticity of the price points is also right at the moment. Hence, we have to look at other options,"" said a senior officer from the department. Last month, the department approached the state govt to allow retail business through the 29,200 liquor vends across the state until 11pm instead of 10pm. The move could result in additional revenue income of Rs 2,000 crore annually. ""But the govt rejected the idea,"" said an officer. As the next step, the department decided to hire a  data analytics  company to study the sales pattern and suggest ways to increase the revenue further. Excise commissioner Adarsh Singh said, ""We are planning to take a data analytics agency on board as has been mandated in the excise policy to augment revenue. Tackling incidents of illicit liquor and unauthorised liquor sales is also on the agenda."" Pushing products that generate increased excise duty would be possible once the state-wide  liquor consumption  data is evaluated. While per litre sale of country liquor yielded about Rs 260 as excise duty on average, the consumption of the same quantity of IMFL yielded Rs 440 as duty fees. Moreover, a beer can (500ml) provided Rs 80 to the department as duty on average."
242,State imports 539 tonnes of fish to meet demand: Min,"Kochi: State has to import 539 tonnes of fish from other states to meet the daily demand, said minister  Saji Cherian  in the assembly in response to a question from MLA  KJ Maxi  on the declining fish production. The minister said Kerala's daily  fish consumption  is 1,742 tonnes, while the requirement stands at 2,281 tonnes. Cherian pointed out that there has been a consistent decline in marine catches over the past several years. In accordance with the new Kerala  Marine Fisheries  Regulation Rules 2018 and recommendations from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), the minimum legal size of 58 fish species has been established to prevent juvenile fishing. The total marine production in 2018-19 was approximately 6.09 lakh tonnes (LT), but it experienced a significant drop in the subsequent two years. The production decreased from 6.90 LT in 2022-23 to 5.8 LT in 2023-24. Despite this decline, Kerala stands second in the country in marine catches, the minister added. Although marine production has decreased, Cherian said there has been a notable increase in the catch from inland fisheries, rising from 2.05 LT in 2019-20 to 2.51 LT in 2023-24.  Moreover, aquaculture production has witnessed substantial growth over the past five years, increasing from 0.25 LT to 2.10 LT."
243,Demand for kirana items up as rural consumption rises,"Indore: A significant surge in  rural consumption  has bolstered the demand for  kirana items  in  Indore , a prominent trade and supply hub for grocery products.  Higher crop yields and better remuneration from crop sales have elevated spending in the country's rural regions, traders and suppliers said. Kirana merchants from the city's bustling  Siyaganj market  reported that the demand for kirana items in Indore from rural areas has increased and has surpassed the volume of previous festive season. Traders estimate that Indore's  sugar consumption , which is currently around 6000 tonne per day, is expected to increase by another 8% during the festive month, while demand for edible oil, dry fruits, pulses, and grains is also expected to rise during the festivals. ""Rural purchases are expected to drive rural demand this season. Demand from rural parts of the state has increased sharply and is expected to rise further during the festive season due to higher crop production and better remuneration from crops,"" said Siyaganj Wholesale Kirana Merchant Association president Ramesh Khandelwal.  Indore is one of the oldest and most prominent trade centres, supplying kirana items within a 150-200 km radius. Traders have begun replenishing their inventories in response to increased enquiries and orders from rural markets in order to meet festive demand. ""We are anticipating a successful season and have placed larger than usual orders for the festive season. Although the next fortnight is likely to be slow due to 'Pitru Paksha,' we anticipate increased purchases in the market after that,"" said Anand Agawal, a kirana trader from Siyaganj market. Siyaganj is one of Indore's oldest kirana markets, with nearly 500 shops, while Malharganj, Malwa Mill, and Marothia Bazaar are other kirana wholesale markets in the city. "
244,Atacama sheds light on a need for greener fashion,"In the era of being the fashion best, ever thought of how much it takes for the environment to make your wardrobe? And what happens to your clothes when you are done wearing it? According to the United Nations, fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, contributing to about 20% of wastewater and 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. Fast fashion refers to the rapid production of inexpensive clothing by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. This business model emphasizes quick turnaround times and low costs, leading to a culture of disposability where clothes are frequently discarded after a few wears. Sustainable fashion refers to a movement and process of fostering change in fashion products and the fashion system towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. It also involves examining the entire production process, from raw materials to the end consumer. Celebrities like Emma Watson have continuously shown their support for sustainable clothing along with Cate Blanchett, Kate Middleton and Alia Bhatt, taking a step towards practising the 3Rs, and re-wearing outfits at high-profile events to make a sustainability statement."
245,"Fossil fuel use, emissions hit records in 2023, report says","LONDON: Global fossil fuel consumption and  energy emissions  hit all-time highs in 2023, even as fossil fuels' share of the global energy mix decreased slightly on the year, the industry's statistical review of world energy report said on Thursday.  Growing demand for fossil fuel despite the scaling up of renewables could be a sticking point for the transition to lower  carbon energy  as global temperature increases reach 1.5C (2.7F), the threshold beyond which scientists say impacts such as temperature rise, drought and flooding will become more extreme.  ""We hope that this report will help governments, world leaders and analysts move forward, clear-eyed about the challenge that lies ahead,"" Romain Debarre of consultancy Kearney said.  Last year was the first full year of rerouted Russian energy flows away from the West following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and also the first full year without major movement restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Overall global primary energy consumption hit an all-time high of 620 Exajoules (EJ), the report said, as emissions exceeded 40 gigatonnes of CO2 for the first time.  ""In a year where we have seen the contribution of renewables reaching a new record high, ever increasing global energy demand means the share coming from fossil fuels has remained virtually unchanged,"" Simon Virley of consultancy KPMG said.  The report recorded shifting trends in  fossil fuel use  in different regions. In Europe, for example, the fossil fuel share of energy fell below 70% for the first time since the industrial revolution.   ""In advanced economies, we observe signs of demand for fossil fuels peaking, contrasting with economies in the Global South for whom economic development and improvements in quality of life continue to drive fossil growth,"" Energy Institute chief executive Nick Wayth said.  Industry body the Energy Institute, together with consultancies KPMG and Kearney, has published the annual report since 2023. They took over from BP last year, which had authored the report, a benchmark for energy professionals, since the 1950s.  Fossil fuel accounted for almost all demand growth in India in 2023, the report said, while in China fossil fuel use rose 6% to a new high.   But China also accounted for over half of global additions in  renewable energy  generation last year.  ""China adding more renewables than the rest of the world put together is remarkable,"" KPMG's Virley told reporters.  Here are some highlights from the report on 2023:  * Global primary energy demand rose by 2% in 2023 from 2022,to 620 EJ.  * Fossil fuel use rose 1.5% to 505 EJ, which accounted for 81.5% of the overall energy mix, down by 0.5% from 2022.  * Fossil fuel use did not increase in a single European country in 2023.  * Electricity generation rose by 2.5% in 2023, up slightly from 2.3% of growth the previous year.  * Renewable fuel generation (excluding hydro) gained 13% toa new record high of 4,748 terawatt-hours (TWh).  * Renewables' share of the overall energy mix excludinghydro was 8%, up from 7.5% in the 2022 report.  * Including hydro renewables accounted for 15% of the global mix.  *  Oil consumption  exceeded 100 million bpd in 2023 for the first time ever, following a 2% year-on-year rise.  * Oil supply growth was met by non-OPEC+ producers, with US output gaining 9% on the year.  * China overtook the US as the country with the largest refining capacity in the world last year at 18.5 million bpd, though refining volumes still lagged behind at 82% utilisation vs the US' 87%.  * Global gasoline consumption hit 25 million bpd last year, just above its 2019 pre-pandemic level.  * Biofuels production increased by 8% to 2.1 million bpd in2023, driven by gains in the US and Brazil.  * The US, Brazil, and Europe accounted for 80% of global biofuels consumption.  * Global  gas production  and consumption remained relatively flat on the year in 2023.  * LNG supply rose by almost 2% to 549 billion cubic metres (bcm).  * The US overtook Qatar as the leading global supplier of LNG after a 10% rise in production.  * Overall European gas demand was down 7% on the year in2023.  * Russia's share of European gas supply was just 15% in2023, from 45% in 2021.  * Coal consumption hit a new high of 164 EJ in 2023, up 1.6% on the year, driven by China and India.  * India's coal consumption exceeded that of Europe and North America combined.  * US coal consumption fell by 17% in 2023 and has halved in the last decade.  * The record high in renewable generation was driven by higher wind and solar capacity, with 67% more additions in those two categories in 2023 than 2022.  * As much as 74% of net growth in overall power generation came from renewables.   * China accounted for 55% of all renewable generation additions in 2023, and was responsible for 63% of new global wind and solar capacity.  * Emissions grew by 2% on the year to exceed 40 giga tonnes.  * Emissions rose despite the slight drop in fossil fuels' share of the energy mix, because emissions within the fossil fuels category became more intense as oil and coal use rose and gas held steady.  * The report notes that since 2000, emissions from energy have increased by 50%."
246,Common daily habits that secretly damage the brain,"We often ignore our health and do not think about it in the long run. We tend not to be careful when it comes to our physical and  mental health . We push ourselves harder everyday to meet targets and deadlines, we succumb to the demands and reliance of technology and we become a part of the rat race without realizing what it might cause to our health. Have you ever thought what less sleep might do to your body in a few years? Have you ever cared to put your thoughts in how bad is the one can of coke for your body? No! Here are a few things which you must read and share with your near and dear ones about how small acts of carelessness damages your brain. Physical activity is said to enhance cognitive functions such as memory and concentration. It is also believed to increase neurogenesis, or the birth of neurons. Lack of exercise may then lead to dullness in the mental capacity and even cognitive decline. Physical inactivity has also been linked to a higher level of stress and anxiety due to reduced levels of endorphins. This imbalance can be critical for disrupting mood regulation and overall mental health. Therefore, regular daily exercise is important for the maintenance of brain function and mental health. Continuous listening to loud music can result in damage to hearing and raise stress levels, which, in turn, can cause cognitive decline. The auditory cortex can become too worked up with the constant sound waves, since this part of the brain works to control focus and memory. The high-volume music will heighten the level of cortisol inside the body, which would directly affect mental health and cause anxiety. While music provides a number of benefits in terms of mood improvement and overall cognitive performance, it should be played with strict consideration toward volume to avoid hearing damage or, in general,  brain health . Overconsumption of sugar-rich foods can cause a lot of damage to brain health. Increase in sugar has been proven to be associated with impaired cognitive functions such as memory loss and poor learning ability. Sugar can cause inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which harm the cells of the brain and could even result in neurodegenerative diseases. A diet high in sugar can also lead to insulin resistance, which affects the metabolic functioning of the brain and leads to poor cognitive performance. Regular consumption of sugars also changes mood regulation and predisposes the individual to mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Keeping the consumption level of sugar in checked and keeping to a normal diet may ensure healthy brain functioning. Getting less sunlight causes issues with mental health as the production of serotonin and melatonin-the neurotransmitters that are vital for mood regulation and smooth sleep-will be disturbed. Sunlight increases serotonin levels and, therefore, enhances well-being with lower risks of depression. Without sufficient light, a condition referred to as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) might be triggered and exacerbate anxiety and depression. Besides these factors, reduced sunlight exposure can compromise the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D that is responsible for play-acting key roles in  cognitive function  and general brain health. According to many scientists, exposure to nature light tends to facilitate and maintain mental balance and cognitive performance. Chronic  dehydration  can severely impact brain health by impairing cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and overall mental clarity. The brain is highly sensitive to changes in hydration levels, and even mild dehydration can affect neurotransmitter production and brain cell communication. Persistent dehydration may lead to increased stress levels and reduced cognitive performance, making it harder to focus and process information. Additionally, inadequate hydration can cause headaches, mood swings, and decreased mental alertness. Maintaining proper hydration is crucial for optimal brain function and overall mental well-being, highlighting the importance of regular fluid intake for cognitive health. Chronic stress  has a profound impact on brain health, affecting both cognitive function and emotional well-being. Prolonged stress elevates cortisol levels, which can impair memory and learning by damaging the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for these functions. Additionally, chronic stress disrupts the balance of neurotransmitters, leading to mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. It also accelerates brain aging and can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Effective stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, exercise, and adequate rest, are essential for maintaining cognitive health and emotional stability, underscoring the need for proactive stress reduction strategies."

248,Alcohol and liver health: How to drink responsibly,"Consumption of alcohol and its impact on the  liver  is a widely discussed topic in the health sector. The impact of consuming huge amounts of alcohol is known to all, but what remains unknown and unexplored is the data behind this. Alcohol-related liver diseases are rising, especially among young adults. As per a report published in the Journal of hepatology in 2023, liver disease accounts for two million deaths annually and is responsible for 4% of all deaths (1 out of every 25 deaths worldwide) and alcohol is one of the most common risk factors. Alcohol-related liver diseases and other chronic liver diseases account for more than 2% of the deaths in India. For instance, Goa Medical College data reveals that out of the 5,500 patients admitted every month, 25% could have alcohol-related issues. Since 2021, Goa Medical College has been seeing more than 300 deaths annually due to alcoholic liver disease. And the profile of the typical patient is changing too. A few years ago, patients in their mid-forties and fifties would get liver cirrhosis, but today, it isn't common to see even men in their early twenties. The age of drinking has fallen. Also, the quantity of drink consumed in a single sitting by some is high,â said senior psychiatrist Dr Rajesh Dhume, who is also a nodal officer at Drug Treatment Centre (DTC), North Goa district hospital told TOI.  The burden of liver disease, including cirrhosis, is increasing globally and in India. This necessitates creating awareness, knowing more about the liver diseases associated with alcohol, and ways to modify lifestyle.  Alcohol consumption  is a major concern globally. In 2018, a study published in the Lancet found that globally, one in three people drink alcohol (equivalent to 2.4 billion people), and 2.2% of women and 6.8% of men die from alcohol-related health problems each year, which is equivalent to 2.8 million deaths each year worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease, on the health risks associated with alcohol between 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries, published in the Lancet suggests that there is no safe level of alcohol as any health benefits of alcohol are outweighed by its adverse effects. 2.4 billion people worldwide consume alcohol and on average, each day women consumed 0.73 alcoholic drinks, and men drank 1.7 drinks. Alcohol exerts a multifaceted impact on the human body, affecting nearly every organ system and increasing the risk of various diseases and disorders. It is a ubiquitous part of many cultures worldwide and has a profound impact on the human body. From its initial consumption to its metabolism and eventual excretion, alcohol affects various systems and organs, sometimes with detrimental consequences. When alcohol is consumed, it rapidly enters the bloodstream through the walls of the stomach and the small intestine. Its effects begin to manifest as it reaches the brain, where it acts as a depressant on the central nervous system. This results in altered perception, impaired judgment, and reduced inhibitions, commonly known as intoxication. The extent of these effects depends on factors such as the amount of alcohol consumed, the individual's tolerance, and their rate of consumption. Beyond the immediate effects on cognition and behavior, alcohol affects numerous bodily systems. It can disrupt the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure. Prolonged heavy drinking can contribute to the development of conditions like hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias, significantly increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Alcohol also affects the gastrointestinal tract, irritating the lining of the stomach and intestines and increasing the risk of conditions like gastritis, ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Chronic alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor for the development of gastrointestinal cancers, particularly those of the esophagus, stomach, liver, and colon. Moreover, alcohol impairs the body's ability to absorb essential nutrients, leading to deficiencies in vitamins such as B12, folate, and thiamine. These deficiencies can have far-reaching consequences, contributing to neurological disorders like peripheral neuropathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and cognitive impairment. The immune system is also compromised by alcohol consumption, making individuals more susceptible to infections and impairing the body's ability to heal from injuries and illnesses. Chronic alcohol abuse weakens the immune response, increasing the risk of infectious diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Alcohol's impact extends to mental health as well. While it initially produces feelings of euphoria and relaxation, chronic alcohol abuse can lead to the development of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). These conditions can significantly impair an individual's quality of life and increase the risk of self-harm and suicide. Furthermore, alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have severe consequences for both the mother and the developing fetus. Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), which encompass a range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive impairments, including facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral problems. While moderate alcohol consumption may have some purported health benefits, excessive or chronic abuse poses significant risks to physical and mental well-being. Education, awareness, and responsible drinking practices are essential for minimizing the adverse effects of alcohol on individuals and society as a whole.  Alcohol metabolism in the liver is a complex process that can have significant effects on  liver health  when alcohol consumption exceeds the liver's capacity to metabolize it. The primary pathway for alcohol metabolism in the liver involves the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). ADH converts alcohol (ethanol) into acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct. Acetaldehyde is then further metabolized into acetate by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is less toxic and can be further metabolized into carbon dioxide and water for elimination from the body.  Acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of alcohol, is highly toxic and can damage liver cells. It reacts with proteins, DNA, and lipids, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. Acetaldehyde also impairs liver function by disrupting mitochondrial function, interfering with energy production, and inhibiting the synthesis of essential molecules. Alcohol metabolism generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as free radicals and peroxides, which can cause oxidative damage to liver cells. ROS are highly reactive molecules that can oxidize lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to cellular dysfunction and injury. Chronic alcohol consumption overwhelms the liver's antioxidant defenses, leading to oxidative stress and further damage to liver tissue. Alcohol metabolism disrupts the normal metabolism of fats in the liver, leading to the accumulation of fat droplets within liver cells. This condition, known as alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), is an early manifestation of alcohol-induced liver damage and can progress to more severe liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. To create awareness around the liver and keep it healthy, World  Liver Day  is observed on April 19 every year. It was started by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in 2010. ""The liver, a critical organ in the body, carries out essential physiological functions such as detoxification, regulating metabolism, and producing vital proteins. It holds the distinction of being the body's largest organ and plays a crucial role in purifying blood before circulating it throughout the body. Despite its pivotal role, liver health is often neglected, resulting in around 1.5 billion individuals worldwide suffering from various liver diseases annually, including fatty liver disease. Chronic liver diseases claim the lives of nearly 2 billion people each year. These statistics underscore the importance of adopting healthy liver practices to safeguard our liver health,"" says Dr Punit Singla, Director & HOD, Marengo Asia Hospitals Gurugram. Liver diseases may stem from various factors, spanning genetic predispositions to excessive alcohol intake and viral infections. ""Some tips for a disease-free, healthy liver are limiting alcohol consumption, Maintaining a healthy weight, Avoiding unhealthy foods, Getting regular check-ups, and timely vaccinations. Liver diseases can remain undetected for extended periods but may inflict significant harm in the interim or by the time symptoms manifest and the disease advances. This underscores the critical importance of routine evaluations of liver health, encompassing overall body health, to forestall the deterioration of liver conditions if they exist. Should symptoms of liver disease such as fatigue, jaundice, or abdominal discomfort arise, seeking prompt medical guidance is essential to address the issue as early as feasible,"" Dr. Singla recommends.  ""Here are some suggestions to help young adults moderate their alcohol intake: It's important to know your personal boundaries; recognise the effects of alcohol on your body and adhere to them to prevent intoxication. Set limits for yourself by determining how many drinks you can have on any given occasion or week. To pace yourself and stay hydrated, switch up your alcoholic beverages with water or non-alcoholic ones to cut down on your overall intake,"" says Dr. Saibal Chakravorty, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine, Metro Hospital Noida. ""To avoid dangerously high levels of drunkenness and the risks that come with them, such as accidents and alcohol poisoning, avoid binge drinking. Keep an eye out for peer pressure and surround yourself with friends who appreciate your moderation when it comes to drinking. When drinking, schedule your transportation in advance, either by hiring a driver or taking public transportation,"" he added.  Balancing alcohol consumption with liver health is essential for minimizing the risk of alcohol-related liver diseases and maintaining overall well-being. Here are several strategies to help achieve this balance: Here are some key symptoms to be aware of:"
249,How Reliance-led Campa is taking on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo at half the price of these soft drinks,"Campa vs Coke, Pepsi:  Reliance Consumer Products  (RCPL) is intensifying the cola price war by expanding its Campa soft drink range to various new markets before the festive season, offering prices that are 50% lower than those of  Coca-Cola  and  PepsiCo .  In response, the multinational brands are ramping up consumer promotions at grocery stores and quick-commerce platforms, although they have not yet reduced their prices. Industry executives told ET that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are facing a dilemma: either drop prices and risk hurting profitability or maintain prices and potentially lose market share to a lower-priced competitor. Any pricing decisions, however, must be made in agreement with independent bottling partners. RCPL entered the Indian  soft drinks market , which is dominated by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, in 2022 by introducing the Campa range in various pack sizes and flavors at significantly lower price points than its established rivals in select markets. After a slow start, RCPL is now expanding the Campa brand across multiple markets, including southern states, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, at disruptive prices. An industry executive said, ""RCPL has hinged its FMCG strategy on affordable pricing across categories including beverages, biscuits, confectionery and detergents, at price points 30-35% lower than rivals.""  This strategy aligns with the company's internal policy of being ""consumer-centric"" rather than ""competition-centric.""  For instance, Campa sells 250 ml bottles at Rs 10 each, while Coca-Cola and PepsiCo sell the same size for Rs 20. Additionally, Campa offers 500 ml bottles at Rs 20, whereas its larger competitors sell them at either Rs 30 or Rs 40. Ravi Jaipuria, chairman of RJ Corp, whose group company Varun Beverages is PepsiCo's bottling and distribution partner, recently addressed an analyst's question about the potential impact of Campa's entry into the market. Jaipuria expressed confidence in the market's growth potential, saying, ""We think every new person coming in has a chance to grow the market. Reliance is a formidable competition but they will have to put more investments, more plants, more visi-coolers and we are sure being Reliance, they will do a good job. The market is so large in India, with more investments the market will only grow much faster."" Soft drink companies have been working to reduce the seasonal nature of their products by introducing new promotions and campaigns, particularly during the festive months of October to December, in addition to the peak summer quarter of April to June, which remains the most significant in terms of annual sales. According to a report released by global research firm Kantar in June, the consumption of bottled soft drinks in Indian households surpassed an annual penetration of 50% in 2023-24. The report stated, ""The bottled soft drink category grew 41% by MAT (moving annual total) in March '23 and continued to add more households and expanded 19% in MAT in March '24."" Financial data accessed by Tofler, a business intelligence platform, revealed that Coca-Cola India reported a consolidated profit of Rs 722.44 crore in FY23, representing a 57.2% increase compared to the previous year. Varun Beverages also reported a strong performance, with a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,262 crore for the June '24 quarter, a 26% growth over the same quarter in the previous year, attributed to volume growth and improved margins."
250,Vegan cosmetics: What makes them different,"The entire scenario of the beauty industry has taken a drastic turn over the past few years. Throughout history, hazardous substances such as parabens, formaldehyde, and synthetic scents have dominated the makeup industry and these chemicals have affected health by interfering with hormones, causing skin irritation. However, with time the focus has started to shift towards âclean beautyâ. Today people do not just mindlessly shop based on packaging and brand name. Ever since the pandemic, consumers have demanded much more transparency about the ingredients that are present in the products they use. Reports suggest that India is the third-largest consumer of vegan cosmetics in the world with an estimated consumption of US $1.5 billion. This shift is not just a trend but a response to increasing awareness about the potential health risks which are associated with conventional cosmetic ingredients and the environmental impact of their production. Vegan cosmetics are those products that are made without any animal-derived ingredients or by-products like beeswax, lanolin, collagen, and keratin. These ingredients are typically sourced from animals. Instead, vegan cosmetics rely on plant-based ingredients, minerals, and safe synthetic alternatives to achieve the same.  Choosing clean and vegan products offers environment-friendly benefits and boosts consumer attention while helping them achieve the perfect glow with the right product. Therefore, by eliminating these toxins, vegan cosmetics provide a safer option for consumers who are conscious of what they put on their skin. Additionally, the cruelty-free aspect of vegan cosmetics ensures that no animal testing is involved in the product development process. As sustainability continues to take centre stage with beauty products, today numerous beauty brands have shifted to producing vegan cosmetic products. Here are some essential steps to consider when selecting vegan cosmetic products: One of the first steps in choosing vegan cosmetics is to read the product labels thoroughly. Look for certifications such as ""vegan,"" ""cruelty-free,"" and ""toxin-free ingredients. These certifications indicate that the product does not contain animal-derived ingredients and has not been tested on animals. Also, make sure to familiarise yourself with common non-vegan ingredients to avoid, such as carmine (a red pigment made from crushed beetles) and gelatin (derived from animal bones and tissues). Conducting research is vital to understand the brands and products you are considering. Many reputable brands are transparent about their ingredient sourcing and production processes. Visit brand websites, read customer reviews, and check for third-party certifications from organisations like PETA, Leaping Bunny, or The Vegan Society. These certifications ensure that the products meet strict vegan and cruelty-free standards.  Before fully incorporating a new product into your beauty routine, it is essential to conduct a patch test. Apply a small amount of the product to a discrete area of your skin, such as the inside of your wrist or behind your ear, and wait 24-48 hours to see if any adverse reactions occur. This step helps to ensure that the product is suitable for your skin type and does not cause any irritation or allergic reactions. Today numerous brands are working towards producing beauty products that are safe, clean, and vegan. As a result, what began as a fad has gradually evolved into a way of life for people. Vegan products have now become a healthy and sustainable alternative to traditional beauty products. According to Statistics, the vegan cosmetic industry is set to increase at a CAGR of 3.53% by 2028 annually. As the availability of high-quality vegan cosmetic products continues to expand, the future of beauty looks brighter, cleaner, and more compassionate. And embracing this will not only benefit the skin but also the planet, making vegan cosmetics a win-win for everyone. (Inputs by: Mr. Mihir Jain, Sales and Marketing Director, Insight Cosmetics)"
251,American cancer society identifies 6 factors that are linked to almost half of all cancer cases,"Cancer  is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is a complex challenge affecting millions globally. It claims many lives each year, but some risk factors are within our control. By addressing these modifiable factors through healthier lifestylesâquitting smoking, eating nutritious foods, staying active, using sunscreen, and moderating alcoholâwe can reduce cancer incidences and save lives significantly. A new study published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, the flagship journal of the  American Cancer Society  close to 50% of all cancer cases can be prevented by making changes in 6 risk factors.  The study from the American Cancer Society has said: Lung cancer had the highest number of cancer cases (201,660) and deaths (122,740) attributable to evaluated risk factors, followed by female breast cancer (83,840 cases), skin melanoma (82,710), and colorectal cancer (78,440) for attributable cases and by colorectal (25,800 deaths), liver (14,720), and esophageal (13,600) cancer for attributable deaths. Large numbers of cancer cases and deaths in the United States are attributable to potentially  modifiable risk factors . Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer.  Smoking emerges as the most dominant modifiable risk factor for cancer, implicated in almost 20% of cancer cases and nearly one-third of cancer-related deaths. Its impact spans across several types of cancers, prominently lung cancer but extending to others like bladder, throat, and pancreatic cancers. The detrimental impact of tobacco smoke is multifaceted, from introducing carcinogens directly into the body to promoting genetic mutations and impairing immune function, thereby fostering tumor development and progression. Obesity is linked to higher risks of colorectal, breast (post-menopausal), and esophageal cancers, among others. Excess body weight is not just a number on a scaleâit significantly impacts cancer treatment and outcomes in several profound ways. When we carry extra weight, our bodies undergo complex changes that can fuel cancer growth and make treatment more challenging. Excess body fat produces hormones and growth factors that promote inflammation and cell proliferation, creating an environment conducive to cancer development and progression. For example, in breast cancer, fat tissue can increase estrogen levels, which may stimulate hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Moreover, obesity can complicate cancer treatment itself. Surgical procedures may be more technically difficult and carry higher risks, such as wound complications or infections. Radiation therapy might be less effective in obese patients due to difficulties in targeting tumors accurately and increased toxicity to surrounding healthy tissues. Chemotherapy doses might need adjustment because drug distribution in fat tissue can alter its effectiveness. Fortunately, even modest weight loss can make a significant difference.  Alcohol consumption heightens the likelihood of developing cancers of the liver, mouth, throat, and breast. Its effects on cancer treatment are profound and often overlooked. The link between alcohol and cancer is well-established, with even moderate drinking increasing the risk of several cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, liver, breast, and colon. During cancer treatment, alcohol can interfere with the body's ability to heal and recover. For instance, it can weaken the immune system, making it harder to fight off infections or recover from surgery. Alcohol also impacts how medications are processed in the body, potentially reducing the effectiveness of chemotherapy or increasing the risk of side effects. Liver cancer, in particular, is directly linked to alcohol consumption. Excessive drinking over time can lead to cirrhosis, which increases the likelihood of developing liver cancer. For those undergoing treatment for liver cancer, alcohol consumption can exacerbate liver damage and complicate recovery. Reducing alcohol consumption or abstaining completely can significantly improve cancer treatment outcomes.  Physical inactivity is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor for cancer. While exercise is well-known for its cardiovascular and muscular benefits, its role in reducing cancer risk is equally crucial. Sedentary lifestyles contribute to a higher likelihood of developing several types of cancer, including colon, breast (post-menopausal), and endometrial cancers. The mechanisms linking physical inactivity to cancer risk are multifaceted. Regular physical activity helps regulate hormones such as insulin and estrogen, both of which can promote cancer growth when levels are chronically elevated. Exercise supports a healthy immune system, crucial for detecting and eliminating early cancerous cells before they can proliferate. Physical activity plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy body weight. Obesity, often a consequence of insufficient exercise, is a significant risk factor for many cancers. Exercise helps to burn excess calories, reduce fat tissue, and maintain muscle mass, all of which contribute to a lower overall cancer risk. It promotes better circulation and oxygenation of tissues, which can reduce inflammationâa common denominator in many chronic diseases, including cancer. Improved circulation also enhances the delivery of nutrients and removal of waste products from cells, supporting overall cellular health and resilience against cancerous changes. Incorporating regular exercise into daily routines doesn't require extreme measures; even moderate activities like brisk walking, swimming, or cycling can make a difference. Small changes, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or scheduling short exercise breaks during the day, can gradually increase physical activity levels and reduce cancer risk. By prioritizing movement and regular exercise, individuals can significantly enhance their overall health and reduce their chances of developing cancer later in life. Infections like Human Papillomavirus (HPV) are directly linked to an increased risk of developing several types of cancer. HPV is a common virus transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, most often during sexual activity. While the body's immune system can often clear HPV infections without any symptoms, persistent infections with high-risk HPV strains can lead to cellular changes that may progress to cancer over time. HPV is notably associated with cervical cancer, where nearly all cases are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV types. The virus can also lead to cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx (the middle part of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils). Vaccination against HPV has proven highly effective in preventing infections with the most common cancer-causing strains of the virus. The HPV vaccine is recommended for both boys and girls before they become sexually active, ideally between ages 9 to 12, as it provides the best immune response at this age. Regular screenings, such as Pap smears for cervical cancer, can detect precancerous changes early, allowing for timely intervention and treatment. ""These findings reinforce that the morbidity and premature mortality from cancer in the United States can be substantially reduced through broad and equitable implementation of known preventive initiatives, such as excise taxes on cigarettes to reduce smoking, screening for and treating HCV infection, and vaccination against  HPV infection ,"" the researchers have said. Reducing cancer risk through lifestyle changes involves practical steps that anyone can take. Start with quitting smoking, which is single-handedly the most impactful action. Seek support from friends, family, or cessation programsâit's tough but incredibly rewarding for your health. Next, maintain a healthy weight through balanced nutrition and regular exercise. Focus on a diet rich in colorful fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting processed foods, sugars, and fats. Stay active! Find activities you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or sportsâit all counts toward lowering your cancer risk. Limit alcohol intake; moderation is key to reducing risks for cancers like breast and liver. Protect yourself from the sun with sunscreen, hats, and clothing to prevent skin cancer. Get vaccinated against viruses like HPV and hepatitis B, which can lead to certain cancers. Regular screenings and check-ups are crucial too; early detection saves lives. Always remember, small changes add upâincorporate these steps gradually into your routine for lasting benefits. Your choices today can significantly impact your cancer risk tomorrowâempower yourself with knowledge and take charge of your health!"

253,Indiaâs palm oil use rises to 38% of total edible oil consumption: APOA,"Indore: Indiaâs  palm oil  consumption has increased to around 38 per cent of the total  edible oil consumption , said Asian Palm Oil Alliance ( APOA ) on Friday claiming increase in  domestic cultivation  of palm oil may cut down edible oil imports.  APOA is an apex edible oil industry association formed by five major palm oil importing countries India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal with an aim to promote cultivation of palm oil and safeguard the economic interest of palm oil and marginal farmers associated with cultivation of the vegetable oil.  Indiaâs annual domestic consumption of edible oil is around 24-25 million tonne of which 9 million tonne is palm oil.  To meet the domestic demand, India imports around 15-16 million tonne edible oil annually, according to APOA. Atleast 9-10 million tonne additional edible oil is required annually to bridge the deficit in domestic demand. âIndia is the worldâs largest importer of palm oil and is committed to becoming self-sufficient in edible oil production. Palm oil has been a staple in various food and non-food products in India for centuries. Though in recent years, misleading reports about its impact on health, nutrition and environment have surfaced, causing harm to marginal farmers and the economy,â said APOA chairman Atul Chaturvedi. Under the National Mission on Edible Oils â Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), govt of India is aiming to push production of palm oil to 1.12 million tonne, covering close to 1.0 million hectare by 2025-26.  âWe have created an Indian palm oil sustainability standards platform and have asked the govt to adopt it. Despite its pivotal role, palm oil faces negative perceptions fueled by myths regarding its environmental and health impacts. These misconceptions not only harm the industryâs reputation but affect the Indian economy. We along with an agri conglomerate are working with thousands of farmers who have taken palm cultivation in India,â said Dr Shatadru Chattopadhyay, managing director, Solidaridad Asia, an international civil society organisation working to facilitate development of socially responsible, ecologically sound and profitable supply chains.  Industry players from the oil industry spoke about usage of palm oil and cultivation adopted by farmers in India in a conference held by Solidaridad, APOA and Solvent Extractorsâ Association on Friday.  âPalm oil gives 5-10 per cent higher oil production than other oil seeds and it can help India achieve self-sufficiency in domestic consumption because its consumption is growing significantly and economic costing makes it a perfect vegetable oil for consumption,â said APOA secretary general Suresh Motwani."
254,How to avoid Monday morning dread after a weekend out,"After a long work week, weekends are usually a time to unwind and have fun with friends. The excitement of a night out often includes cocktails or a quick shot, but they come back to haunt us on a Monday morning. Headaches, nausea, and fatigue â the dreaded  hangover  â can turn a relaxing weekend into a struggle. This feeling, coupled with the looming work week, can make Monday mornings a nightmare. This can make it difficult to focus, reduce productivity, and set a negative tone for the rest of the week.

255,Can consuming oil actually make you fat? Myths busted about oil consumption,"There is much excitement in nutrition circles with the release of the latest edition of the  Dietary Guidelines  for Indians-2024 by the ICMR-NIN Expert Committee on May 8, 2024. While there is much to discuss about these guidelines, letâs focus on fats and oils. Guideline 7 of the document states, âUse oils/fats in moderation; choose a variety of oil seeds, nuts, nut cereals, and legumes to meet daily needs of fats and  essential fatty acids  (EFA).â Evidently, a  healthy diet  does not need to be fat-free. Even diets aimed at weight loss do not recommend completely eliminating fats.  Fats and oils  provide fullness, satisfaction, and delay hunger. Despite this, for various reasons, this food group has acquired a bad reputation. It is important to understand that our fat requirements should be met from the foods we eat, including the fats/oils used for cooking. Almost all the foods we consume, whether cereals, millets, pulses, beans, or vegetables, contain some fat. Nuts, oilseeds, meats, and dairy products are particularly known for their inherent fat content. These fats, though not visible, are crucial for meeting our  nutritional needs , especially for essential fatty acids. The oils/fats used for cooking should be consumed in moderation to complement our daily nutrient requirements. Fats are known to be calorie-dense, but their metabolic functions are less widely understood. They play a major role in hormone production, gene expression, and cell signalling. Additionally, fats enhance the palatability of food by improving flavour, texture, and taste, which can sometimes lead to overconsumption. This is where Guideline 7 becomes essential. According to Dr. Neelanjana Singh, registered dietitian and wellness consultant, âFats consist of fatty acids, categorised into three types: Saturated fatty acids (SFA), Polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). It's essential to obtain n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA from our diet, hence they are referred to as essential fatty acids. Maintaining the ideal ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA is critical and in our current diets very high levels of n-6 PUFA has become a concern.â The guidance on trans fats (hydrogenated oils) is clear: avoid them actively. They are commonly found in many bakery items, ready-to-eat processed foods. Checking food labels can help avoid these fats. It's advisable to limit processed foods and prefer freshly cooked meals. While not downright harmful, saturated fats do become detrimental if consumed in excess. Fats like ghee, coconut oil, and palm oil are high in saturated fats. It's recommended to limit saturated fat to one part of the total fat intake (SFA: MUFA: PUFA ratio should be 1:1:1), allowing only a teaspoon of such fats in an adult's daily diet. The uniqueness of each saturated fat should be understood to leverage their properties. Coconut oil and ghee are used in certain therapeutic diets for their special absorptive properties.  Contrary to popular belief, palm oil or palmolein can also be part of the healthy balanced diet when consumed responsibly in appropriate amounts. Natural compounds present in palm oil, such as tocotrienols and beta-carotene, support cardiovascular health and provide neuroprotection. Palm is a stable oil at high temperatures, hence oxidative products are minimised when cooking. Moreover, Palm oil has 40% of its fatty acids as MUFA which are known to play a role in reducing atherogenesis (fatty deposits in the arteries). About 30% of the calories in a 2000 calorie diet should come from fat, which equates to approximately 55 grams, including both visible and invisible sources. The visible fat from  cooking oil  should be limited to 20-25 grams or 4-5 teaspoons per day, with only one teaspoon coming from saturated fats like ghee, palm oil or coconut oil. Virgin and  cold-pressed oils  are highly valued. Cold-pressed oils (kacchi ghani ka tel) are extracted without using heat treatment thus preserving phytonutrients, whereas virgin oils are obtained from the first extraction process, which may involve mechanical pressing with or without heat. Such oils can contain undesirable compounds such as gums, waxes, pesticide residues, aflatoxins and allergens. Refining oils removes these compounds, making them safer for consumption, but also reducing beneficial components like antioxidants and phytosterols. Heat, light, and air are the three enemies of fats. It's important to store fats/oils in dark containers, away from light and heat, with tightly fitting lids. After frying foods, filtering out food particles from the leftover oil is a must. This oil should be used only for low-temperature cooking (not for frying again) and consumed within a day or two. Repeated frying in the same oil generates toxic compounds. The belief that adding fresh oil to used oil will counteract any negatives is incorrect; it actually leads to quicker deterioration.  Balancing different kinds of fatty acids can be challenging. Dietitians can assess diets and suggest approaches to achieve this balance. Cooking methods that require little added fat, like steaming, boiling, poaching, sautÃ©ing, and grilling, should be preferred. Fried foods prepared in suitable oil may be consumed occasionally in limited portions. Let's not undermine the importance of this food group, but also be conscious of not underestimating the amounts consumedâmuch of it is invisible! This awareness can lead to better health outcomes."
256,Foods and diet that can increase milk production in new moms,"A newborn's nutrition and development is significantly enhanced by breastfeeding, which supplies antibodies and other necessary nutrients that strengthen the infant's immune system. Making sure there is a sufficient supply of breast milk can be a worry for many new mothers. A number of variables, such as nutrition, hydration, and general health, are important for milk production. Breastfeeding  promotes the supply and demand of milk, but specific foods and dietary habits might help maintain and improve an adequate supply of breast milk.  1. Oats: Oats, being high in fiber and iron, are thought to aid in the formation of milk. They give energy and support normal blood sugar levels, both of which are vital for breastfeeding moms. 2. Fenugreek: Traditionally, this herb has been used to boost milk production. You can drink fenugreek tea or add it to food to help induce lactation. 3. Fennel: Phytoestrogens found in fennel seeds and bulbs may improve milk production. One popular beverage among nursing moms is fennel tea.  4 Nuts and Seeds: Essential fatty acids and proteins found in almonds, flaxseeds, and chia seeds help improve the production of breast milk. They are a wonderful supply of nutrients and energy as well. 5. Milk and Dairy Products: According to Dr. Pallavi Vasal- Clinical Director Obstetrics and Genecology, Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram, âProtein intake must be increased for the formation of milk, and consuming milk and other dairy products aids in this process. They also supply calcium, which is essential for the mother and the child.â 6. Lentils: Lentils are a fantastic source of protein and can stimulate the production of breast milk. They are high in fiber and iron as well. 7. Porridge and Seasonal Millets: In addition to being nutrient-dense, these whole grains support sustained energy levels. They aid in the production of milk and are simple to digest. 8. Thoroughly Washed Green Veggies A healthy intake of vitamins and minerals is ensured by consuming a range of green vegetables. Cleaning thoroughly gets rid of any dangerous pesticides or bacteria. It's essential to stay hydrated if you want to continue producing enough milk. Throughout the day, nursing moms should make an effort to consume lots of water, herbal teas, and natural juices. For general health and maximum milk production, a diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables must be balanced. Increasing your consumption of milk, lentils, and almonds will help your body meet its demands for protein during nursing. Making sure there is an adequate supply of breast milk is a major responsibility for nursing mothers. A balanced dietary intake, staying hydrated, and include  lactogenic foods  in the diet can all help to dramatically increase milk production.

The   has issued notices to  ,  Patanjali  Ayurveda, and the Central government following a petition that claims one of Patanjaliâs products,  Divya Manjan , contains  non-vegetarian  ingredients despite being marketed as  vegetarian . This case has sparked significant interest and concern among consumers and regulatory bodies alike. The controversy centers around Divya Manjan, an herbal tooth powder produced by Patanjali. The product is labeled with a green dot, a symbol that indicates it is vegetarian. However, the petitioner, advocate Yatin Sharma, alleges that the product contains an ingredient called  samudraphen , which is derived from Sepia officinalis, commonly known as cuttlefish bone. This ingredient is of animal origin, which contradicts the vegetarian label on the product. Yatin Sharma, who belongs to a Brahmin community, has used Divya Manjan for a long time, trusting its vegetarian claims. He discovered the presence of samudraphen through recent research and was deeply distressed by this revelation, as his religious beliefs prohibit the consumption of non-vegetarian products. Sharmaâs petition argues that this misbranding violates the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and has caused significant emotional distress to him and his family. The petition also highlights that Baba Ramdev himself admitted in a YouTube video that samudraphen is an animal-based product used in Divya Manjan. Despite filing complaints with various government agencies, including the Delhi Police, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, and the Ministry of Ayush, Sharma claims that no action has been taken so far. This lack of response prompted him to seek judicial intervention. On August 30, 2024, the Delhi High Court took up the plea and issued notices to Patanjali Ayurveda, Baba Ramdev, the Central government, and Patanjaliâs Divya Pharmacy, which manufactures the product. Justice Sanjeev Narula sought responses from all parties involved, and the next hearing is scheduled for November 28, 2024. The courtâs decision to issue notices indicates the seriousness of the allegations and the need for a thorough investigation. The case has raised broader questions about product labeling and consumer rights in India. The green dot symbol is widely recognized and trusted by consumers who follow vegetarian diets for religious or personal reasons. Any misrepresentation of this symbol can lead to significant breaches of trust and potential legal consequences for companies. Patanjali Ayurveda, founded by Baba Ramdev and  , has grown rapidly since its inception, offering a wide range of Ayurvedic and herbal products. The company has built a reputation for promoting natural and traditional Indian remedies. However, this case could impact its credibility and consumer trust if the allegations are proven true. The outcome of this case will be closely watched by consumers, regulatory bodies, and the business community. It underscores the importance of accurate product labeling and the need for companies to adhere to regulatory standards. As the legal proceedings continue, the focus will be on ensuring transparency and accountability in the marketing and labeling of consumer products."
258,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates concerned with Donald Trumpâs second presidency, donates $50 million to Kamala Harrisâ campaign, says âthis election is differentâ","Microsoft co-founder   has privately donated approximately $50 million to support Vice President  's presidential campaign through a nonprofit organisation, The New York Times reported. Gates made the contribution to  Future Forward USA Action , the nonprofit arm of the main outside fundraising group backing Harris's campaign. The organisation operates as a 501(c)(4) "" dark money "" group, meaning the donation will not appear in public filings, according to sources briefed on the matter. In private conversations throughout the year, Gates has expressed concerns about the implications of a second Trump presidency. While Gates lacks a personal relationship with Harris, he has publicly celebrated the  Biden-Harris administration 's  climate change  policies, and sources close to his foundation indicate serious concerns about the future of family planning and global health programs under a potential second Trump term. ""I support candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change in the U.S. and around the world,"" Gates told the Times. While not explicitly confirming the donation, he added that ""this election is different, with unprecedented significance for Americans and the most vulnerable people around the world."" The contribution represents a significant departure for Gates, who in 2019 explicitly stated, ""I choose not to participate in large  political donations ."" With an estimated net worth of $162 billion, Gates has historically maintained a bipartisan approach to advance his global philanthropic work. Sources indicate that Gates's children, Rory and  Phoebe Gates , played a crucial role in encouraging their father's political engagement. Both in their early to mid-20s, the siblings have emerged as Democratic donors themselves, contributing millions largely derived from their parents' wealth. Gates has reportedly discussed his pro-Harris donation with other potential donors, including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is considering a similarly sized contribution to the organisation. Melinda French Gates , the billionaire's former wife, has also made contributions to Future Forward's nonprofit arm during this election cycle, further highlighting the family's increased political engagement."

261,Global alliance of 131 CEOs for climate action cut emissions while boosting revenues: WEF,"NEW DELHI: A group of 131 CEOs of the  Global Alliance  for  climate action  representing some big companies from across 27 countries, including India, had reduced 10% of aggregate absolute emissions between 2019 to 2022 while recording 18% aggregated growth in their revenues during the same period, according to a report from the   (WEF) which shows that the economic growth and climate actions can go hand in hand. The report, released on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday, noted that the 18% aggregate revenue growth, surpassing global GDP growth of 15%, was amounted to over $640 million whereas  emission reduction  of 10% was equivalent to 450 megatons, roughly the annual emissions output of France or the United Kingdom. The Alliance is the worldâs largest CEO-led community focused on  net-zero emissions , representing $4 trillion in revenue and 12 million employees in 12 industries, including healthcare, retail, heavy industry and agriculture. Tata Steel, ReNew, Hindustan Zinc, Mahindra Group, Infosys and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, launched alongside the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change. CEOs of big tech multi-national companies such as Microsoft, Dell, HP, Bloomberg LP, Ericsson and Hitachi are also part of the group. âThe alliance is showing that businesses can collectively make significant progress towards implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement,â Sumant Sinha, chairman and CEO of ReNew and co-chair of the Alliance, was quoted as saying by the WEF.  Underlining that the economics of climate action can work in all regions â from emerging markets to developed economies, Sinha said, âWe hope these results encourage more businesses to join us in applying their knowledge and skills to transition to a truly global, net-zero economy that benefits communities all around the world.â The report flagged that the 10% decrease in absolute emissions is significantly ahead of the emissions reductions achieved by the worldâs biggest economies and emitters, including the United States (-2%) and the European Union (-3%). In contrast, India and China saw growth in emissions of 6% and 7% respectively, in the same period. âThis clearly demonstrates that positive climate action does not have to come at the expense of economic performance,â said Gim Huay Neo, managing director, WEF."
262,Kamala Harris' climate advocacy questioned as presidential campaign racks up millions in private jet expenses,"US vice president  â presidential campaign has come under debate for its extensive use of  private jets , spending millions on air travel despite her strong advocacy for urgent  climate action , as per  Fox News . Harris secured the  Democratic nomination  after President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election. The campaign has spent at least $3.8 million on private flights in just six weeks, according to a review of Federal Election Commission (FEC) records. The Harris campaign made payments to various private jet companies, including  Advanced Aviation  Team, Private Jet Services Group, Principal Aviation, and FlexJet between July 24 and August 30. The largest share of the payments went to Advanced Aviation, a company offering luxurious aircraft ranging from smaller jets for short trips to ultra-long-range planes with amenities and flight attendants for journeys up to 16 hours. Harrisâ campaignâs use of private jets has sparked criticism due to the significant environmental impact of such travel. According to the National Library of Medicine, private aviation is the most energy-intensive form of air travel, using 10 to 20 times more fuel per passenger than commercial flights. Harris has long positioned herself as a champion of climate action, referring to  climate change  as an âexistential threatâ to humanity. During a 2019 interview with CNN, she said, ""Thereâs no question we have to be practical. But being practical also recognises that climate change is an existential threat to us as human beings... it is well within our capacity to change our behaviours in a way that reduces its effects."" At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2023, Harris said, âThe clock is no longer just ticking, it is banging... We need transformative change and exponential impact.â She has also expressed concern about the effect of climate change on younger generations, noting that âclimate anxietyâ has left some hesitant to have children. The Biden-Harris administration has set ambitious climate goals for the aviation industry, aiming for a 20% reduction in  aviation emissions  by 2030, with a target of net-zero emissions by 2050."

He said $300 trillion is available globally and $150 trillion is available in sovereign funds and pension funds, noting that international financial institutions such as ADB and World Bank need to use guarantees and blended finance to allow much more private finance into the countries of global south, particularly India. Kant was speaking here at a brainstorming session on  climate action  issues, organised by a Delhi-based think tank Climate Trends ahead of the upcoming G20 in Brazil and UN climate change conference (CO) in Azerbaijan, scheduled next month. For India, he said, the country needs to have very strong tripartite agreement between the Centre, states and RBI to ensure private entities get some return on their investment. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, economist and former deputy chairperson of the erstwhile Planning Commission, and R R Rashmi, TERI's distinguished fellow and India's former climate negotiator were also among those who shared their views on different aspects of climate actions and climate finance."
264,Fridays for Future: Students hold climate protest in city,"New Delhi: Students under the aegis of  Fridays for Future  Delhi, along with its allies and the youth of Delhi, participated in global climate strike on Sept 20, demanding immediate  climate action  from policymakers. The participants took out a march from the ITO metro station to Delhi Secretariat, where participants presented their demands. They asked for immediate reduction in  greenhouse gas emissions , adequate policies to empower cyclists in Delhi, urban flooding and stormwater management in Delhi-NCR, adequate waste management policies, and imposition of hefty fines for improper waste management, as well as climate education and awareness. Swayansiddha Panda, a second-year student at Delhi University, said five trees are being cut down every hour in Delhi. ""Many of us are already struggling with respiratory issues and rely on medication. It is crucial for all govts to take immediate action to protect our forests and tree cover. We are here to demand the preservation of these natural oxygen towers, which will play a major role in our future and on our health,"" said Panda. Shiv Chauhan, a class XII student, said: ""We are taught in school to plant and save trees, segregate waste and not use plastic, but the adults in these esteemed offices are doing just otherwise. We are here to remind them that the decisions they will take will affect our health and future."" Abhipsa Behera, a student at DU, said: ""We are here to demand clean air, clean water. That is our birth right. We are demanding accountability. Delhi govt and the Centre must hear our voices because this crisis is too urgent to ignore. It's about saving the number of years we are losing to pollution."" Fridays for Future said they want an immediate halt to the cutting of trees inside forests or green covers in the name of development or urbanisation. ""We demand a rapid transition to renewable energy sources and phasing out of fossil fuels,"" a protestor said. tnn"
265,Youth activists plan protests to demand action on climate as big events open in NYC,"NEW YORK: Activists geared up Friday for protests around the world to demand action on climate change just as a pair of major weeklong climate events were getting underway in  New York City . The planned actions in Berlin, Brussels, Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi and many other cities were being organised by the youth-led group  Fridays for Future , and included the group's New York chapter, which planned a march across the Brooklyn Bridge followed by a rally that organizers hoped would attract at least 1,000 people. More protests were planned Saturday and Sunday.  New York is hosting Climate Week NYC, an annual event that promotes  climate action , at the same time the U.N. General Assembly takes up the issue on several fronts, including raising trillions of dollars to aid poorer countries suffering the most from climate change.  The New York protest was to take aim at ""the pillars of fossil fuels"" - companies that pollute, banks that fund them, and leaders who are failing on climate, said Helen Mancini, an organiser and a senior at the city's Stuyvesant High School.  Youth  climate protests  started in August 2018 when  , then an unknown 15-year-old, left school to stage a sit-down strike outside of the Swedish parliament to demand climate action and end fossil fuel use.  In the six years since Thunberg founded what became Fridays for Future, global carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels has increased by about 2.15%, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor carbon pollution. The growth of emissions has slowed compared to previous decades and experts anticipate peaking soon, which is a far cry from the 43% reduction needed to keep temperature increases to an agreed-upon limit.  Since 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from coal have increased by nearly 1 billion tons (900 million metric tons), while natural gas emissions have increased slightly and oil pollution has dropped a tiny amount, according to the International Energy Agency. That growth has been driven by China, India and developing nations.  But emissions from advanced or industrialized economies have been falling and in 2023 were the lowest in more than 50 years, according to the IEA. Coal emissions in rich countries are down to levels seen around the year 1900 and the United Kingdom next month is set to shutter its last coal plant.  In the past five years, clean energy sources have grown twice as fast as fossil fuels, with both solar and wind individually growing faster than fossil fuel-based electricity, according to the IEA.  Since Thunberg started her protest six years ago, Earth has warmed more than half a degree Fahrenheit (0.29 degrees Celsius) with last year setting a record for the hottest year and this year poised to break that mark, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European climate agency Copernicus.

267,"Early warning systems, safe infra key to reducing lightning deaths: Study","HYDERABAD: Central and northeast India account for the highest incidence of  lightning deaths , according to a study. Data revealed that  central India  alone accounts for 50,884 (50%) deaths.  The study was carried out by researchers led by Fakir Mohan University, Balasore, Odisha. Lightning, though a common natural phenomenon, especially during the monsoon, is less talked about, Professor Manoranjan Mishra of the university's department of geography said, stressing that climate-induced extreme events were witnessing an increasing trend across India. He attributed increased incidence of lightning strikes to  environmental degradation ,  climate change , regional variability, high population exposure, geographical and climatic diversity, inadequate  early warning systems  and socio-economic factors. The study was meant to provide insights into the reasons behind patterns of increasing lightning fatalities and to contribute to the development of effective lightning protection systems, policies. Prof Mishra also said the significant changes observed in central India, northwest India and south peninsular India could be attributed to several interconnected factors.  Citing how the US, Australia and Latin America tackle lightning-related disasters, he said: ""We too can prevent lightning deaths with improved awareness and education. We need to have early warning systems and lightning-safe infrastructure in place. Also, increased investment in research and data collection and community engagement are key."" The study explains that developing countries like India are well-prepared for cyclones, floods, and droughts, but ill-equipped to deal with lightning and heat waves. The study, published in the journal, 'Environment, Development and Sustainability', said the Northeast, which has been experiencing changes in rainfall patterns, temperature and extreme weather events, has also seen a sharp rise in  lightning incidents  thanks to massive deforestation, depletion of water bodies, global warming.  The  National Disaster Management Authority  has instructed states and Union territories to prepare lightning action plans.  However, only seven out of the 36 states and union territories have come up with these plans so far. Most vulnerable states, including Telangana, MP, Odisha,   and Bengal have not yet prepared the action plans, the researchers said."
268,Avaana Capital secures $135 million in final close for climate fund,"BENGALURU:  Avaana Capital , a climate-focused venture capital firm, has secured total commitments of $135 million for the final close of its Avaana Climate and  Sustainability Fund , it said in a statement on Wednesday. The Mumbai-based firm was initially targeting a total corpus of $100-125 million for the fund, which will focus its investments in three sectors that it said are responsible for 90% of India's emissions: energy transition and resource management, mobility and supply chains, and sustainable agriculture and food systems. Led by Anjali Bansal, Swapna Gupta, and Shruti Srivastava, Avaana Climate and Sustainability Fund will also invest in tech-driven and innovative climate solutions. The fundâs portfolio investments include Eeki Foods, Aerem, Kazam, sentra.world, FarMart, Eggoz, Turno and Terra.do.  The fund has attracted institutional investors, including Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), Self Reliant India (SRI) Fund, the UK India Development Cooperation Fund (UKIDCF), and corporates such as Godrej Group and Murugappa, among others. âIndia is at a pivotal moment in its climate action journey. The support weâve received from leading global and domestic institutional investors underscores the importance of innovation in driving climate action and delivering long-term impact,â Bansal, partner, Avaana Capital, said. Climate-tech investments in India have surged, attracting $1.2 billion from 2016 to 2020, with a focus on renewable energy and electric mobility. To achieve India's net-zero emissions goal by 2070, about $2.5 trillion in investments is needed by 2030, Avaana had said earlier. âOur investments around the world are boosting development in emerging economies and we see immense potential in India. DFCâs support for Avaanaâs  climate fund  is a great model to push early-stage startups in India, dedicated towards new technologies and innovation, and deliver impactful, climate-resilient solutions,â Mateo Goldman, senior vice president for investments at the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), said."
269,Indiaâs Women Climate Collective announces new cohort to expedite leadership in climate action,"BATHINDA: To amplify women's voices in  climate action  and ensure their equitable participation in designing and implementing  sustainable solutions , WCC, a platform created by Foundation L'OrÃ©al with the support of Purpose Climate Lab has launched its next cohort focused on nurturing 20 young women leaders in climate action. These women work on pertinent and diverse issues, including climate justice, nature-based solutions, climate technology, public engagement for climate, and climate-related health and food security, spanning regions and areas of expertise. The 2023 report âFeminist climate justice: A framework for action,â by the UN Women points out that by 2050, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty and see 236 million more face food insecurity.  Though climate change significantly affects those working in the natural resource sectors, such as agriculture, its impact is not the same on men and women. Women happen to be more vulnerable due to various soci0-economic and cultural factors. Climate change also compounds the issues faced by underserved women and girls by deepening existing inequalities, disrupting education, health services, mobility and curtailing employment opportunities.  In India, where the effects are particularly pronounced, these challenges are compounded by regional vulnerabilities impacting underserved women and girls the most. This will deepen existing inequalities and disrupt education, health services, mobility, and even employment opportunities.  Recognising the pivotal role that women can play in driving effective climate action, the  Women Climate Collective  (WCC), a collective of women working in the climate or gender ecosystem, is strategically consolidating its efforts to amplify women-led initiatives. Their cohort highlights the unique challenges faced by women while also underscoring their contributions to the global climate discourse.  In 2023, the WCC programme built the capacities of 16 women  climate leaders , some of whom represented India on key global platforms including COP28 and were recognised through prestigious awards including Nidhi Pant who won the Earthshot Prize, Elsie Gabriel who received the face of India Achievers Award, and more.  KG Sreeja, who was part of the 2023 cohort, said, âBeing part of the WCC cohort has helped in gaining a more granular gendered perspective of our work on co-creating community resilience to tidal flooding. It has helped in thinking and acting in gender specific ways over and beyond gender inclusive strategy and planning. Gender specific action has helped us identify the singular strength of women in the climate action space. It has become the natural progression from gender inclusive work and I strongly believe it is due to the work and networking I have been doing with WCC.â  The leaders of new cohort will be provided tailored  leadership  training, communication, and access to international and national events, enabling them to participate in global climate discussions and showcase their work on an international platform. By elevating their groundbreaking work, the WCC platform aims to foster collaboration, networking, and knowledge sharing among the leaders, ultimately promoting  gender-inclusive  climate solutions in India. They will also have access to industry experts in the form of WCC Ambassadors, that will further support the climate leaders to grow and scale their efforts; Mamta Borgoyary, Executive Director, SHE Changes Climate and Shloka Nath, CEO, India Climate Collaborative, both prominent women leaders in nurturing climate action in India, will be supporting the new cohort of WCC women leaders.  Reflecting on the impact of the program, Mamta Borgoyary, Executive Director, SHE Changes Climate, shared her thoughts: âThe WCC programme's unwavering commitment to fostering women's leadership in climate action is truly inspiring. The new cohort is composed of exceptional women dedicated to addressing critical climate issues, and I am thrilled to support them. I have witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of WCCâs programs, and I am confident that these emerging women leaders will drive meaningful change and amplify their voices within India's climate ecosystem.â  âAs India faces repercussions of climate change - from floods, landslides to severe heatwaves, the urgency for a just climate transition is undeniable. Women, who are disproportionately impacted by climate change, facing higher risks of displacement, water scarcity and food insecurity must have equal opportunity to lead mitigation and adaptation strategies. That's why, for the second year running, the  Fondation L'OrÃ©al  welcomes 20 inspiring women to our Climate Collective. Because supporting women leadership in climate action isn't just the right thing to do â it's the only way forward.â says Rachel BarrÃ©, Fondation LâOrÃ©al Women and Climate program Director.  As the 2024 cohort begins their journey, they embody the immense promise of empowering women to take lead in combating climate change. In India, where the impacts of climate change are deeply felt, the involvement of women leaders is more important than ever. "
270,"Govt ups ante, revised climate action plan will concentrate on seven critical sectors","New Delhi: A state-level action plan to address climate change will concentrate on seven critical sectors:  energy and power ,  urban planning , water, forest and biodiversity, transport, agriculture and horticulture, and health. Each of the sectors will have respective mitigation and adaptation measures. Environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday announced that Delhi govt was in the process of finalising the plan. Rai said that while Delhi govt already had an existing climate change action plan in place â it was implemented in 2019 and is set to remain in effect until 2030 â the new action plan was essentially a revision of the previous one, as mandated by Centre. At a roundtable conference, chaired by Rai and attended by over 40 departments, experts and officials on Wednesday, the urgent need for action was highlighted, with the city facing unprecedented heatwaves and record rain. Rai said a comprehensive policy would be crafted and sent to Centre for approval. ""The way nature has been tampered with in the blind race of development all over the world has led to climate change globally, and now it has started having a direct impact on people's lives. This year, the people of Delhi had to face heatwaves. Apart from this, the monsoon rains broke the records of the last several years. Similarly, we are also battling air pollution and are constantly working to reduce it. Today, policies are being made on climate change all over the world so that its components can be identified and controlled,"" he said. Rai said the pace of climate change had compelled govt to revise its policy. ""Delhi govt started the process of revising the policy of climate change two years ago. A core group was formed among different departments and stakeholders for this, under which several meetings were held. A steering committee was formed under chairmanship of chief secretary to finalise the proposal of the core group. That committee proposed a draft policy for climate change in Delhi,"" he said. He added that Centre was working on making this policy in the entire country in collaboration with German Technical Cooperation Group (Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ). ""This group helped us prepare the draft for Delhi. These 40 institutions, including IIT Delhi, GGIPU and Technical Energy and Research (TERI), along with various departments of Delhi govt and Centre, participated in this conference,"" Rai said. He said a proposal had been made to identify the sources of climate change in different sectors and devise a comprehensive policy, and Delhi govt was sending the same to Centre. A detailed action plan of the policy will follow soon after suggestions from Centre are received. "
271,Need climate finance goal that truly meets needs of developing countries: UN climate chief,"At the UN climate conference in Baku, countries must agree on a new goal for international  climate finance  that truly meets the needs of developing nations, with  public finance  at its core, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said on Thursday. He said  COP29  must be the ""stand-and-deliver"" COP, recognising that climate finance is critical to saving the global economy and billions of lives and livelihoods from the devastating impacts of climate change.  Addressing a virtual event hosted by the Brookings Institution, Stiell said, ""At COP29 in Baku, all governments must agree on a new goal for international climate finance that truly responds to the needs of  developing countries ... It is not my job to prejudge what the new goal will look like. But it is clear public finance must be at the core.""  He added that as much of this finance as possible should be in the form of grants or concessional funding and made more accessible to those who need it most.  ""And we must make climate cash count, wherever possible, leveraging more private finance and sending signals to financial markets that green is where the gains are,"" he said.  At this year's UN climate conference (COP29), countries are expected to agree on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), the new amount developed nations must mobilise every year starting in 2025 to support climate action in developing countries.  Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, high-income industrialised countries are responsible for providing finance and technology to help developing nations combat and adapt to climate change.  These developed countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and EU member states such as Germany and France have historically benefited from industrialisation and contributed significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.  At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, these nations pledged to provide USD 100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries.  However, this target has not been fully met, creating a significant financial gap that has eroded trust and hindered climate action in developing nations.  In May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that developed countries had surpassed the USD 100 billion-a-year target by providing nearly USD 116 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2022, with nearly 70 per cent of the money provided in the form of loans.   Stiell noted that the countries could decide ""who pays and how much"" at COP29 in Baku but cautioned, ""We are not going there to renegotiate the Paris Agreement"", referring to efforts by some developed nations to broaden the list of countries contributing to climate finance, with Switzerland and Canada proposing criteria to expand the donor base.   Developing countries argue that discussions on expanding the contributor base go beyond the mandate for the NCQG and could derail negotiations on the new climate finance goal.   Some developed nations, led by the EU and the US, argue that the global economic landscape has changed significantly since the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. They suggest that wealthier nations that have emerged during this period, such as China and some Gulf states, should also contribute to the new climate finance target.   Developing countries view this as an attempt to shift responsibility away from those who have historically benefited from industrialization and contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions.   They argue that expecting them to contribute, especially when many are still grappling with poverty and inadequate infrastructure amid worsening climate impacts, undermines the principle of equity.   Stiell also stressed the importance of implementing mechanisms to track and ensure that promised funds are delivered.   ""More work also has to be done to rapidly ramp up funding for adaptation and get international carbon markets working for everyone. We must fund a new generation of national climate plans.   ""To protect the progress we made at COP28 and convert the pledges in the UAE Consensus -- to triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency, boost adaptation, and transition away from fossil fuels -- into real-world, real-economy results,"" he said.   The UN climate change chief warned that the world is at a moment of profound fracture between and within nations.   ""In times like these, there is a temptation to turn inward. A delusional belief that what happens in my neighbour's backyard is not my problem or concern. If we go down this path, it will soon be game over in the world's climate fight."""
272,Is the NFL Prepared for the Climate Crisis? The Financial Toll on Stadiums That Could Reshape the Future of Football,"All   stadiums across the U.S. face huge financial loss threats due to global warming. As estimated by Climate X, a climate risk analytics firm, by 2050, the venues might experience up to $11 billion in damages due to  climate change . Such damages would translate into higher insurance premiums, higher prices for repairs and might disrupt both the local economy and league operations. Of the 30 stadiums analyzed in this study, many of them stand out particularly concerning the vulnerability to natural hazards brought about by flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat. New Jersey's  MetLife Stadium  is the most vulnerable, with a total amount of projected losses standing at $5.64 billion, which was caused primarily due to storm surge and surface flooding, mostly surpassing the estimated value to replace the stadium. Also Read -  MetLife Stadium is expected to experience extreme future loss,"" said Austin Clack, solution engineer at Climate X. He further averred that the two major contributors to the loss include surface flooding and storm surge. The identification of these perils enables one to consider adaptation measures to reduce the possible damage. In California, the priciest NFL venue,  SoFi Stadium , is likely to incur approximately $4.38 billion in losses mostly from flooding. Similarly, the Arizona Cardinals State Farm Stadium may account for almost $965 million damages, bringing the three stadiums closer to nearly 30% projected losses in 2050. Climate X uses its Spectra platform to analyze risks from authoritative climate models. Even though this report gives ample insight, it is warning over the assumption and uncertainty of adaptations in the future. With the accelerated change of climate, continuous modeling has become the need of the hour. Also recent incidents such as hurricane Milton which devastated the Tropicana Field highlighted urgent risks from extreme weather. ""We have to reduce CO2 emissions to mitigate climate impacts,"" Clack said. Awareness constitutes the first step to resilience and real action, says Clack, and its failure in case of climate impacts will put the NFL in financial ruin since it is the most followed sports league in the world, both widely and lucratively. In return for which taxpayers pump in substantial amounts of investments into stadiums. Thus, a piece of knowledge and a futile attempt to manage these risks are important steps in saving the community centers and economic assets. Also Read - "
273,"Jharkhandâs Land Commons valued at Rs 377,200 crore annually: New report highlights economic and environmental importance","AGARTALA: A newly released brief titled ""Economic Valuation of Land Commons in Jharkhand"" has shed light on the significant economic and environmental value of the stateâs land commons, estimated at â¹377,200 crore annually. This brief, developed by the  Foundation for Ecological Security  (FES) and  Common Ground , was unveiled during the  Conference of Panchayats  (COP) 2.0 in Ranchi. Land commons, which include forests, pastures, and uncultivated lands, are shared resources accessible to all community members. These lands provide essential  ecosystem services  that support the livelihoods of billions globally. The brief emphasizes the urgent need to integrate the economic value of land commons into policy-making and land acquisition processes to ensure their sustainable management and protection. The COP 2.0, organized by Asar, Policy and Development Advisory Group (PDAG), and Damodar Bachao Andolan, focused on enhancing decentralized governance and the critical role Panchayats and Panchayati Raj Institutions can play in advancing  localized climate action plans . The consultation brought together stakeholders from various levels to discuss collaborative approaches to support locally-led climate initiatives. Drawing on data from the paper ""Valuing Ecosystem Services Provided by Land Commons in India: Implications for Research and Policy"" by Harpinder Sandhu et al., the brief highlights the pivotal role of Jharkhandâs land commons in the state's economy and environment. With a heavy reliance on agriculture and natural resources, Jharkhand is particularly vulnerable to climate change, affecting most of its 24 districts. Key Findings: The brief warns of the pressing threats to these commons, including overuse, degradation, and inadequate governance, leading to the loss of valuable ecosystem services and affecting the livelihoods of millions. It calls for legal and institutional reforms, sustainable management practices, and community-based management to protect these lands. Additionally, the report advocates for the inclusion of the economic value of land commons in state accounts and policy decisions, contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring the well-being of future generations. This brief is a crucial resource for policymakers, environmentalists, and community leaders, urging them to recognize and safeguard the socio-ecological and economic values of Jharkhandâs land commons."
274,"VP arrives for 2-day visit, calls for urgent action against climate change","Dehradun: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankar urged urgent action on  climate change , biodiversity loss, and resource depletion. He was speaking at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Indian Institute of Petroleum in Dehradun on Saturday. He is on a two-day visit to Uttarakhand and will also visit Rishikesh and Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC) in Dehradun. He praised the institution for ""developing a patented single-step catalytic process to produce biofuel from plant-derived materials and waste"". He added, ""The world requires collaborative solutions to issues that threaten our existence and demand bold action. Challenges of climate change transcend borders, affecting vulnerable communities and ecosystems."" Dhankar said the transition to  renewable energy  is vital, and India aims to become carbon neutral by 2070. ""We must also focus on optimal utilisation and preservation of natural resources, basing our usage on actual needs rather than financial means. Our economic progress must harmonise with  sustainability , in which science and research play a crucial role,"" he added. He highlighted India's strides in quantum computing, green hydrogen, and 6G technology, cautioning against an overemphasis on govt jobs: ""Enormous opportunities are available in various fields through which  youth  can make contributions to national and global welfare."" He stressed the need to ""de-silo govt opportunities"" and urged the youth to explore new areas. He added, ""India's rise is assured because of the demographic youth power. All we have to do is keep national interest above partisan and self."" He also asked the youth to stay vigilant against those who undermine democracy. ""It is concerning that threats to our democracy come from former leaders and those who held positions of authority. Vigilant sections of society, especially the youth, must expose them. The narrative that what occurs in a neighbouring country can happen here is condemnable. The challenges we face are daunting but not insurmountable,"" he said."
275,"Earth âvital signsâ reach critical extremes, climate experts warn of unpredictable future","A new report from leading climate scientists has issued a new warning that Earthâs âvital signsâ have reached âcritical levels,â with the âthe future of humanityâ hanging on a delicate rope. This comes from a 2023 assessment published in the journal Bioscience, which analysed 35 key indicators of planetary health and found that 25 have already declined by record levels, including rising   levels and rapid population growth. According to the scientists, the world is entering a new, unknown territory of âcritical and unpredictable new phase of the climate crisis.â The scientists call for immediate transformative measures to combat the  climate crisis  and emphasise on restoring the ecosystem.  Driven by record fossil fuel consumption, Earthâs surface and ocean temperatures reached all-time highs in 2023. The report reveals that the global population is increasing by approximately 200,000 people each day, along with 170,000 new cattle and sheep. These trends are contributing to record greenhouse gas emissions, further intensifying  . The scientists identified 28 feedback loops, such as emissions from thawing permafrost, which could trigger catastrophic tipping points, including the collapse of Greenlandâs icecap. Global warming is accelerating extreme weather events across the world. Hurricanes in the U.S. and heatwaves exceeding 50Â°C in India are exposing billions of people to dangerous levels of heat. The experts emphasise that without rapid, decisive action, the human toll will be catastrophic. ""Weâre already in the midst of abrupt climate upheaval,"" said Professor William Ripple from Oregon State University, who co-led the report. ""Ecological overshootâtaking more than the Earth can sustainâhas pushed the planet into dangerous conditions, unlike anything humans have ever witnessed."" Climate change  is already displacing millions of people, and the report suggests that hundreds of millions or even billions could be forced to migrate in the future. Such displacement could lead to geopolitical instability, and in the worst case, partial societal collapse. The report also notes that the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has reached record levels. Methane is 80 times more powerful than CO2 over a 20-year period and is emitted by fossil fuel operations, waste dumps, cattle, and rice fields. The accelerating growth of methane emissions is particularly concerning, according to co-author Dr. Christopher Wolf. Despite a 15% increase in wind and solar energy use in 2023, coal, oil, and gas remain the dominant sources of energy. The report attributes this to the strong resistance from industries that benefit financially from the fossil fuel-based system. The report also referenced a Guardian survey of hundreds of climate experts conducted in May 2023. The survey found that only 6% believe the world will keep global warming below the internationally agreed limit of 1.5Â°C. The researchers stress that avoiding even the smallest increases in temperature is crucial, as each tenth of a degree of warming could expose an additional 100 million people to unprecedented heat. The climate crisis, the report argues, is part of a larger ecological and social breakdown, driven by pollution, the destruction of nature, and rising inequality. The scientists emphasise that climate change is a symptom of deeper systemic issues, namely ecological overshootâwhere humanity is consuming resources faster than the Earth can replenish them. Without transformative changes, these systemic issues could lead to widespread human suffering and the degradation of ecosystems across the planet. The scientists call for bold, transformative changes to combat the climate crisis. Among the policies they recommend are reducing the human population through education and empowerment for girls and women, restoring ecosystems, and integrating climate change education into global school curriculums. As nations prepare for the UNâs COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan in November, the report concludes with a final warning: only through decisive action can we avert severe human suffering and protect future generations.

276,Govt to launch initiative to provide localised weather forecasts to gram panchayats on Thursday,"NEW DELHI: The  Ministry of Panchayati Raj  will on Thursday launch a weather forecast service for  gram panchayats  which will provide them with localised daily weather forecasts for five days and enhance disaster preparedness, an official statement said. Gram Panchayat Level Weather Forecasting, which will be launched in collaboration with the   (IMD), will also allow gram panchayats to check hourly weather forecasts and directly benefit farmers and villagers across the country, said the statement issued by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj on Wednesday.  Panchayati Raj Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lalan and Minister of State for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences (Independent Charge) Jitendra Singh will be present at the launch.  ""As part of the government's 100 Days Agenda, this initiative strengthens grassroots governance and promotes sustainable agricultural practices, making rural populations more climate-resilient and better equipped to tackle environmental challenges,"" the statement said.  This is the first time that  localised weather forecasts  will be available at the gram panchayat level, supported by the IMD's expanded sensor coverage.  The forecasts will be disseminated through the ministry's digital platforms: e-GramSwaraj, Meri Panchayat app, and Gram Manchitra.  ""These tools will also strengthen disaster preparedness and infrastructure planning. Furthermore, SMS alerts will be sent to panchayat representatives regarding extreme weather events like cyclones and heavy rainfall, ensuring immediate action to protect lives, crops, and property. This endeavour is a transformative step toward building  climate-resilient communities  at the grassroots level,"" the ministry said.  A training workshop on ""Weather Forecasts at the Gram Panchayat Level"" will be organised to mark the launch of this initiative. The workshop will be attended by more than 200 participants, including elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions and state panchayati raj officials, it said.  The training session will equip panchayat representatives and functionaries with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilise weather forecasting tools and resources at the grassroots level, empowering them to make informed decisions and enhance climate resilience in their communities."
277,US and South Asia forum unveil plans to address climate change,"Jaipur: In a bid to tackle challenges posed by  climate change , leaders from the US and  South Asia  announced three initiatives to accelerate the deployment of  clean energy  through collaborations and with funding support. Under the  US-South Asia Mayoral Platform  on Clean Energy and Sustainable Cities, local leaders will be empowered to lead municipal clean energy transitions. Meanwhile, the US-India initiative to reduce the  carbon footprint  of cooling devices will mobilise $1 billion for more efficient technologies. Similarly, a Clean Energy Investment Facilitation was announced to close the financial gap for clean energy projects. US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said, ""The new initiatives reaffirm the United States' commitment to partnering with the countries in the region to address the urgent climate crisis through transformative action."" South Asia, home to nearly a quarter of the world's population, faces escalating impacts of climate change, including extreme weather and surging energy needs. These initiatives, supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) through its South Asia Regional Energy Partnership (SAREP), aim to advance the region's clean energy transition, promote sustainable economic growth, diversify clean energy supply chains, and reduce carbon emissions.  Rajasthan Energy Minister Heeralal Nagar said, ""Given the rapid economic growth in South Asian countries, prioritising clean and renewable energy sources is the need of the hour."" Nagar added, ""Collective efforts are essential to effectively combat the global challenges of climate change and ensure public access to renewable energy. I am confident that the discussions at the South Asian Clean Energy Forum will shape future energy policies."" Through the forum, the US is facilitating innovation, cooperation, and investment while partnering with the countries and the private sector to pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future in the region. The clean energy transition will not only reduce emissions but also improve energy security and create opportunities for economic empowerment, driving progress toward global climate goals, the leaders from the countries said."
278,"Heavy metals contaminating Satluj, endangering ecosystem, says study","A study by Punjab-based environmental researchers has exposed alarming levels of pollution in the Satluj that pose a significant threat to  water quality  and  aquatic life . The investigation revealed stark contrasts in water chemistry between upstream and downstream sites, painting a worrying picture of the riverâs health. While upstream areas remain relatively unpolluted, downstream sites are plagued by moderate to severe pollution. The most disturbing finding is the excessive presence of  heavy metals  at downstream sites, which surpass critical thresholds and endanger the riverâs ecosystem, underscoring the urgent need for action to mitigate pollution and protect the Satlujâs water quality. River pollution has reached crisis levels in recent decades, with harmful chemicals, heavy metals, excess nutrients, and household waste contaminating waterways at an alarming rate. The Satluj in Punjab is particularly vulnerable, suffering from pollution caused by domestic and industrial effluents and agricultural runoff. A comprehensive study was conducted to analyse physicochemical parameters along the riverâs course in Punjab during different seasons. The research focused on identifying seasonal distribution patterns of cyanobacteria, their relationships with water chemistry variations, and informing continuous monitoring efforts to ensure water quality. The Satluj originates in Himachal Pradesh and flows into Punjab near Nangal town, passing through Ropar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, and Kapurthala districts before converging with the Beas at Harike and entering Pakistani territory. For this study, the focus was on the portion of the river within Punjab. A thorough survey of the Satluj in Punjab identified eight strategic sampling sites: Nangal, Jol Village, Miani village, Katli, Ropar, Saidpur, Chak Dango, Chuharwal, and Talwandi Kalan. The findings of the study, âSpatiotemporal Distribution of Cyanobacteria in Relation to Water Chemistry of Satluj River, Punjab (India),â conducted by Gurdarshan Singh Rangra, Yadvinder Singh, Komal Thapa and Jasvir Inder Singh Khat- tar and Davinder Pal Singh has been published in the International Journal âEnvironmental Monitoring and Assessmentâ. The  River Pollution Index  (RPI) of various sampling sites along the river revealed significant varia- tions in water quality. Sites with minimal human impact, like Nangal, boasted an RPI of 1.5, indicating unpolluted conditions. Conversely, areas like Jol village exhibited moderate pollution, with RPI values ranging from 3.3 in summer and winter to 4 during monsoons, primarily due to sewage waste from Nangal City and the National Fertilizer Limited. Miani village and Katli, Ropar, recorded RPI values of 2.3 and 2.8, respectively, categorising them as negligibly polluted. Saidpur, Ropar, with an RPI of 3.3, faced contamination from agricultural runoff and Ropar City sewage. In stark contrast, Chuharwal, Ludhiana, and Talwandi Kalan exhibited alarming RPI increases, denoting severe pollution. Notably, Chuharwal marks the confluence of Buddha Nullah with the Satluj river, while Talwandi Kalan lies downstream. The substantial pollution spike at these sites underscores Buddha Nullah's significant contribution to pollutant levels. The study revealed a disturbing trend of increasing heavy metal concentrations along the Satluj River's course. Upstream sites (1-4) showed significantly lower levels of heavy metals, whereas downstream sites (5-8) exhibited substantially higher concentrations. This suggests cumulative additions of heavy metals and other pollutants as the river flows downstream from site 1 to site 8. Arsenic levels ranged from a low of 1.2Â±0.1 Âµg L Â¹ at site 1 during summer to an alarming high of 41.8Â±2.1 Âµg L Â¹ at site 8 during winter. Similar patterns were observed for other heavy metals, including cobalt, chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, iron, manganese, and zinc, underscoring the escalating pollution threat downstream. The heavy metal pollution index (HPI), a key metric for assessing aquatic heavy metal contamination, revealed alarming spatial and temporal variations across the Satluj river. HPI values ranged from 53.02 (site 2, summer) to 2820.18 (site 8, winter), exceeding critical thresholds at downstream sites. Upstream sites (1-4) showed relatively low contamination, with HPI values below 100 (53.02-147.04) across all seasons, indicating reduced heavy metal pollution and better water quality. This suggests minimal anthropogenic impact and effective natural filtration in these areas. Downstream sites exceeded critical HPI thresholds (103.08-2820.18) across all three seasons, signalling severe heavy metal pollution."
279,"Water on Mars: Massive underground 'stable liquid' reservoir found on Mars, claims study","A recent study has revealed that a vast reservoir of liquid water may be hidden deep beneath the surface of  Mars , possibly holding enough to cover the entire planet in a global ocean. This groundbreaking finding, based on data from NASA's  InSight lander , suggests that the  Martian subsurface  might offer conditions conducive to microbial life, either in the past or present. The InSight lander, which operated from 2018 until its mission concluded in 2022, provided seismic data that helped scientists uncover this potential water reservoir. Located approximately 7.2 to 12.4 miles (11.5 to 20 km) below the surface, this water is trapped within fractured igneous rocks. At these depths, the temperature is warm enough to sustain liquid water, unlike the surface, where water would be frozen. ""Temperatures on present-day Mars become warm enough for stable liquid water near the top of mid-crust, and pores are expected to have closed at the bottom of the layer,"" the study said. Planetary scientist Vashan Wright from the University of California, San Diego, and lead author of the study, explained that the presence of liquid water deep within the Martian crust was determined by analysing the speed of seismic waves. These waves change speed based on the rock composition, presence of cracks, and what fills them. The data indicates that a mid-crustal layer of cracked rocks filled with liquid water best explains both the seismic and gravity data collected by InSight. Wright noted, ""If the InSight location is representative, extracting all the water from these fractures could fill a global ocean 1 to 2 kilometers deep."" The discovery of such a vast  underground water reservoir  has significant implications for our understanding of Mars' history and its potential to support life. More than 3 billion years ago, Mars was a warm and wet planet with rivers, lakes, and possibly oceans. This study suggests that instead of escaping into space, much of that ancient water seeped into the crust. ""Large volumes of liquid water transiently existed on the surface of Mars more than 3 billion years ago. Much of this water is hypothesized to have been sequestered in the subsurface or lost to space,"" the study explains. Planetary scientist Michael Manga from the University of California, Berkeley, a co-author of the study, explained that the water likely infiltrated from the surface, similar to Earth's groundwater processes. This historical movement of water suggests that the Martian crust could have been water-rich from its early history. The presence of subsurface water also holds promise for future human exploration. While Mars harbors ice at its poles, accessing this underground liquid water could be challenging due to its depth. Drilling to these depths is a formidable task, but researchers propose investigating regions like Cerberus Fossae, where geological activity might expel water to the surface. The findings from InSight's data provide a tantalizing glimpse into the possibilities for  life on Mars . While the existence of water doesn't guarantee life, it creates environments that could potentially support microbial life. The study, titled ""Liquid water in the Martian mid-crust"" was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and was authored by Matthias Morzfeld and Michael Manga and included contributions from researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and Berkeley."
280,Life on Mars: NASA's Insight Lander finds evidence of water in Martian rocks,"It's 2024 and what if tell you that life saving element, water, has been found on the red planet Mars. Sounds futuristic, right? Well, the Insights Lander which has been on Mars since 2018, has shown the presence of liquid water below the surface of the planet. Water is considered essential for life, and geological studies show the planet's surface had lakes, rivers and oceans more than 3 billion years ago. The findings of the lander have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study has found that the volume of liquid water predicted beneath the surface is ""more than the water volumes proposed to have hypothesized ancient Martian oceans. Scientists hypothesize that water might have infiltrated from the surface to below just like it happens on the Earth. ""On Earth, groundwater infiltrated from the surface"" to deep underground, one of the authors, Vashan Wright of the University of California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""We expect this process to have occurred on Mars as well when the upper crust was warmer than it is today."" The study found that large reservoirs of liquid water in fractures 11.5 kilometres (7.15 miles) to 20km beneath the surface best explained the InSight measurements. The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) was a NASA Discovery Program mission that placed a single geophysical lander on Mars to study its deep interior.  ""It addressed one of the most fundamental issues of planetary science: understanding the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner solar system (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. The mission ended in December 2022 after more than four years of collecting unique science on Mars,"" NASA says about this ambitious mission. InSight was launched on May 5, 2018. The red planet is a stubborn one in hiding secrets and scientists are curious enough to find it out. In 1996, NASA scientists published a paper outlining possible chemical traces of life-forms in a Martian rock that fell to Earth. Known colloquially as the Allan Hills meteorite, or by its official number, ALH84001, it had been collected in Antarctica more than a decade earlier. ""It contained chemical traces similar to those left behind by Earth microbes; some photographs even revealed microscopic features that looked something like bacteria,"" scientists have said. One of the major goals of the Mars 2020 mission was to find life on Mars, NASA says. The earliest attempt to reach Mars and study the possibility of life happened in 1960. After multiple failures, the first successful mission to Mars was NASA's Mariner 4 in 1965, which provided the first close-up images of the Martian surface. Since then, several missions have followed, including NASA's Viking 1 and 2 in the 1970s, which were the first to land on Mars and send back detailed images and data.  The 1990s saw the arrival of the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Pathfinder missions, which delivered groundbreaking information about Mars' geology and climate. In the 2000s, missions like NASA's Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express expanded our understanding of the planet.  The 2010s brought significant milestones with NASA's Curiosity rover and InSight lander, each contributing valuable scientific data. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) in 2014 marked a notable achievement by making India the first country to successfully orbit Mars on its maiden attempt.  Currently, several Mars missions have been successful and some are still operational. India is a frontrunner in this ambitious mission. India's Mangalyaan, officially named the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), represents a significant achievement in space exploration. Launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on November 5, 2013, Mangalyaan was India's first interplanetary mission. Its primary objective was to explore Mars, studying its surface, morphology, and atmosphere. The spacecraft successfully enters Mars' orbit on September 24, 2014, making India the first country to achieve this feat on its maiden attempt. Here are the answers of few FAQs:"
281,5 things to do in the morning for a long and healthy life,"Mornings set the tone for the rest of the day, and the habits we cultivate during these early hours can significantly impact our long-term health and  longevity . While there are numerous ways to start the day, focusing on practices that promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being can make a big difference. Below are five  morning habits  that can contribute to a long and healthy life. Mindful  meditation  is a practice that involves focusing on the present moment, which can reduce stress and anxiety. Research published in the journal Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging found that meditation can increase the grey matter in the brain, which is associated with improved memory, learning, and emotional regulation. Starting your morning with just 10-15 minutes of meditation can set a calm and focused tone for the day, helping you manage stress more effectively and promoting long-term mental health. Hydration is crucial after a night's rest, and starting the day with warm water and lemon can offer several benefits. Lemon water is rich in vitamin C, which supports the immune system, and warm water helps kickstart your metabolism. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition found that consuming lemon regularly can help reduce body fat and improve insulin resistance. This simple habit can aid digestion, boost your immune system, and improve your skin health, contributing to overall well-being. Physical activity  in the morning is a powerful way to boost your energy levels and maintain a healthy weight. A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercise enhances cognitive function and decision-making abilities throughout the day. Whether it's a brisk walk, yoga, or a quick workout session, getting your body moving in the morning can improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and increase longevity. Breakfast is often referred to as the most important meal of the day for a reason. A balanced breakfast rich in nutrients provides the energy and essential vitamins needed to start the day right. According to a study published in Circulation, eating a nutritious breakfast is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Go for foods high in fibre, healthy fats, and protein, such as oatmeal, nuts, fruits, and eggs, to fuel your body and brain for the day ahead. Cultivating a sense of gratitude in the morning can profoundly affect mental health and overall well-being. Research from the Journal of Positive Psychology shows that regularly practising gratitude can lead to increased levels of happiness, improved relationships, and a greater sense of life satisfaction. Start your day by reflecting on a few things you're grateful for, which can shift your mindset towards positivity and reduce stress levels, contributing to a healthier, longer life."
282,James Webb Space Telescope discovers hidden ocean on a Moon of Uranus,"The  James Webb Space Telescope  (JWST) has made a groundbreaking discovery that could change our understanding of the solar system. Using its advanced instruments, astronomers have found evidence suggesting that Ariel, one of Uranusâ moons, might harbor a  hidden ocean  beneath its icy surface. Ariel, discovered by William Lassell in 1851, is the fourth-largest moon of Uranus. It has intrigued scientists for decades due to its unique geological features and the presence of   ice on its surface. The JWST, launched on December 25, 2021, has provided new insights into this distant moon, located about 2.9 billion kilometers from Earth. The discovery was made by a team led by Richard Cartwright from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. They used the JWST to analyze the light spectra from Ariel, which revealed the chemical composition of its surface. The data showed that Ariel has some of the most carbon dioxide-rich deposits in the solar system. This finding is puzzling because, at the distance of Uranus from the Sun, carbon dioxide should turn into gas and escape into space. This suggests that some biological process is replenishing the carbon dioxide on Arielâs surface. One theory is that the carbon dioxide is being produced by interactions between Arielâs surface and charged particles trapped in Uranusâ magnetosphere. This process, known as radiolysis, involves ionizing radiation breaking down molecules and leaving carbon dioxide. However, the new evidence from the JWST suggests that the source of the carbon dioxide might be internal, possibly from a  subsurface ocean . The presence of a hidden ocean on Ariel could explain the continuous replenishment of carbon dioxide. If there is  liquid water  beneath the surface, it could interact with the moonâs rocky core, producing carbon dioxide and other compounds that eventually make their way to the surface. This theory is supported by the detection of carbon monoxide on Ariel, which should not be stable at the moonâs surface temperatures. The carbon monoxide would need to be actively replenished, indicating ongoing geological processes. The discovery of a potential subsurface ocean on Ariel is significant because it adds to the growing list of moons in the solar system that might harbor liquid water. Other examples include Europa and Enceladus, moons of Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. These moons are considered prime targets in the search for  extraterrestrial life  because liquid water is essential for life as we know it. The JWSTâs findings have opened up new avenues for research and exploration. Future missions to Uranus and its moons could provide more detailed information about Arielâs subsurface ocean and its potential for supporting life. The discovery also highlights the importance of advanced space telescopes like the JWST in expanding our knowledge of the solar system. The James Webb Space Telescope continues to revolutionize our understanding of outerspace. Its ability to observe distant objects with unprecedented clarity has already led to numerous discoveries, and its work is far from over. As scientists continue to analyze the data from the JWST, we can expect more exciting revelations about the mysteries of our solar system and beyond. Did you like this article?

283,"8% GDP loss by 2050 foreseen due to world water crisis, over 50% food production at risk","BATHINDA: An international group of leaders and experts warns that unless humanity acts with greater boldness and urgency, an increasingly out-of-balance water cycle will wreak havoc on economies and humanity worldwide. In a report, âThe Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Goodâ, the Global  Commission  on the  Economics of Water  (GCEW) says the water crisis puts at risk more than half of the worldâs food production by 2050. It also threatens an 8% loss of GDP in countries around the world on average by 2050, with as much as a 15% loss in lower-income countries, and even larger economic consequences beyond. Weak economics, destructive land use, and the persistent mismanagement of water resources have combined with the worsening climate crisis to put the global water cycle under unprecedented stress, GCEW says. Nearly three billion people and over half of the worldâs food production are in areas experiencing drying, or unstable trends in total water availability. Further, several cities are sinking due to the loss of water below the ground.  âToday, half of the world's population faces water scarcity. As this vital resource becomes increasingly scarce, food security and human development are at risk â and we are allowing this to happen,â observed Johan RockstrÃ¶m, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and one of the Commissionâs four co-chairs.  âFor the first time in human history, we are pushing the global water cycle out of balance. Precipitation, the source of all freshwater, can no longer be relied upon due to human caused climate and land use change, undermining the basis for human wellbeing and the global economy."" The report argues that existing approaches have led to the water crisis. They ignore the multiple values of water across whole economies and in preserving natureâs critical ecosystems. The widespread under-pricing of water today also encourages its profligate use across the economy and skews the locations of the most water-intensive crops and industries, such as data centres and coal-fired power plants, to areas most at risk of water stress. Proper pricing, subsidies and other incentives must be used to ensure water is used more efficiently in every sector, more equitably in every population, and more sustainably. âThe global water crisis is a tragedy but is also an opportunity to transform the economics of water â and to start by valuing water properly so as to recognize its scarcity and the many benefits it delivers,â said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the  World Trade Organization  and a co-chair of the Commission.  Current approaches also deal predominantly with the water we can see â the âblue waterâ in our rivers, lakes, and aquifers. They typically overlook a critical freshwater resource, namely âgreen waterâ â the moisture in our soils and plant life, which ultimately returns and circulates through the atmosphere, generating around half the rainfall we receive on land. A stable supply of green water is hence linked inextricably to stable patterns of rainfall, itself critical to economies and livelihoods. It also provides crucial support for the natural storage of carbon dioxide in the soil and mitigation of climate change. The water challenge becomes even more pressing when we recognise how much water each person needs daily to live a dignified life. The Global Commission offers a new perspective on a just access to water: While 50 to 100 litres per day is required to meet essential health and hygiene needs, a dignified life â including adequate nutrition and consumption â requires a minimum of about 4,000 litres per person per day. Most regions cannot secure this much water locally. Although trade could help distribute water resources more equitably, it is hampered by misaligned policies and the water crisis itself. The Commission argues that the crisis demands bolder, more integrated thinking, and a recasting of policy frameworks â in short, a new economics of water. It begins by recognising that the water cycle must now be governed as a global common good. This can only be done collectively, through concerted action in every country, through collaboration across boundaries and cultures, and for benefits that will be felt everywhere.  Critically, we must redefine the way we value water properly to reflect its scarcity, while at the same time recognising the multiple benefits of water and a stable global hydrological cycle across economies. We must shape economies to allocate and use water properly from the start, and avoid having to fix problems such as water pollution and other âexternalitiesâ after the fact. The report calls for a fundamental regearing of where water sits in economies, enabled by a âmission-drivenâ approach. This paradigm shift requires the participation of all stakeholders, from local to global, to achieve the missions that address the most important challenges of the global water crisis.   Such missions would encourage innovations, capacity building and investments, and be evaluated not in terms of short-run costs and benefits but, rather, for how they can catalyse long-run, economy-wide benefits. âWe must move beyond a reactive market-fixing approach toward a proactive market-shaping one that catalyses mission-oriented innovation and builds symbiotic partnerships around our biggest water challenges. Only with a new economic mindset can governments value, govern, and finance water in a way that drives the transformation we need,â said  Mariana Mazzucato , Professor at University College London where she is Founding Director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP), and one of the co-chairs of the Commission. The report recommends five such missions: Launch a new revolution in food systems, transform agriculture to sustain the planet by scaling up micro-irrigation and radically improving water productivity, reducing reliance on nitrogen-based fertilisers, spreading regenerative agriculture, and shifting progressively away from animal to plant-based diets.  Conserve 30% of forests and restore 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030. Priority should be given to protecting and restoring those areas that can best contribute to a stable water cycle.  Capture the full value of every drop by treating and reusing wastewater, reducing distribution inefficiencies and recovering valuable resources.  Renewable energy, semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) are defining a new economic era. We must spur innovation with high ambitions and secure equity, sustainability and efficiency to ensure their growth does not exacerbate global water stresses or constrain the benefits they provide. Currently, over 1,000 children die every day from unsafe water. Ensure access to clean water for rural and hard-to-reach communities, including investing in decentralized water treatment and sanitation systems.  The Commission has identified critical enablers for the five missions, reflecting key aspects of this new way of governing, nationally and internationally to benefit people and the planet: Govern partnerships, property rights, and contracts for a just and sustainable water future. Forge more symbiotic partnerships and address legacy water rights using conditionalities. Shape finance for a safe, just and sustainable water future. Address public and private underfunding; redirect harmful subsidies; establish âJust Water Partnershipsâ to design, implement and finance transition towards a just and safe water future in low- and lower-middle-income countries.  Improve global water data infrastructure; promote corporate water footprint disclosure covering green and blue water, and value water as natural capital. Create a multi-sectoral Global Water Pact to address both green and blue water challenges and stabilise the hydrological cycle.  The Report calls for governments across the world to deliver a ânew course for water at every scaleâ and reinvigorate structures of international cooperation to address shared water challenges.  Tharman Shanmugaratnam , President of Singapore and one of the co-chairs of the Commission, said: âWe can only solve this crisis if we think in much broader terms about how we govern water. By recognising waterâs interactions with climate change and biodiversity. By mobilising all our economic tools, and both public and private finance, to innovate and invest in water. By thinking and acting multilaterally."
284,Would you choose the corporate grind or life on a farm? Netizens share their thoughts,"Most people want to have a job that makes them happy and have a good  work-life balance , and they strive for it their whole life. But considering the fast-paced world we live in and the hectic schedules people have, it seems to be a distant dream for many. More recently, a post regarding this has garnered much attention on social media. It makes one ponder over what leads to true happiness-- the lure of the corporate world or the simple farm life. In a recent tweet,  Blackmarsh Homestead , which is the official profile of a family living on an isolated farm in the Croatian lowlands, asked their followers a simple question which soon sparked an online debate amongst netizens. Their tweet which was posted on September 15 read, ""Would you rather make spreadsheets in someone else's office, or haul manure on your own farm?"" and within 48 hours of being posted, it got roughly 5 million views and some 900 comments (and counting). This simple question about what kind of lifestyle one would prefer soon became a topic of debate amongst many. While the post got mixed reactions by people, it surely made one think about what  true happiness  means to them. Here's what some of them said: Commenting in favour of working in the corporate world, X user named Triode replied, ""Spreadsheets hands down. People romanticize farming but itâs not that great having to milk cows every day at the same time rain or shine, or if youâre sick or well. Weeding gardens on your hands and knees is back breaking work."" While X user Menandros said, ""I would rather not tire heavily my back and my arms again. Don't romanticize harsh manual labor, it's more gruesome than you believe and it will leave you absolutely destroyed."" Another X user Curt K jokingly said, ""At least hauling manure on your own farm you know how much shit you'll have to deal with."" Talking about the many benefits of working on a farm, X user 3Sheepinatrenchcoat wrote, ""It doesn't matter who's farm it is, I'd take the manure any day. When compared to the exercise, meditation, and just overall freedom that comes with working outdoors, working in an office is a miserable affair. We weren't designed for it and it destroys both mid and body."" Whereas, X user Mapple shared his views on striking a fair balance between the corportae and farm lives. ""Done both, going back to spreadsheets (and IT in general) fulltime and parttime farm management ;) It's a great way of life and can work if you either don't need much money, or have a ton of money and can do it at a huge scale. Smaller scale and big mortgage etc doesn't work :)"". Joe Coco, another X user, shared that his dream job is to have his own farm. ""I was an investment advisor for decades. I only did it so I could retire early, buy a farm, and grow my own food. Farming is in my blood. It is almost magical producing food from your own land"". Another X user Emma shared how her parents used to destress by being on the farm every summer. ""I see Finnish on her top! I think in my case, it's a two wolves kinda thing. My parents had high ranking executive corporate jobs, but during the summer leave they'd chop firewood, renovate, carry water to the sauna, forage & empty the outhouse at our summer house for months."" Netizens' mixed reactions to the post shows that while some people would prefer grinding in the corporate world and making more money, others would choose to have a simpler life on the farm. Well, to each their own as long as it makes them happy. What are your views on it? Would you rather grind in the office or work on the farm? Tell us in the comments below."
285,Yamuna river pollution hits record high in Delhi: Faecal coliform levels soar in September,"NEW DELHI: The faecal levels, depicting  untreated sewage  and high-level pollution in the river  , reached an all-time high in September. This occurred even as the levels of  dissolved oxygen  (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which, despite being below standards, have slightly improved, thanks to the surplus rain in August. However, even the August rain couldn't improve the levels of  faecal coliform , which at its peak was a whopping 4,900,000 MPN (most probable number)/100 ml. This is 1,959 times higher than the standard of 2,500 units and 9,800 times the desired limit of 500 units. This was the worst pollution in the river, in terms of faecal coliform, since February 2022, when the faecal level at Agra Canal (one of the stations at the river stretch in the city) had reached 6,300,000 units. The faecal level in the river was assessed by the  Delhi Pollution Control Committee  (DPCC) for the month of September, a report of which was released on October 4, with samples collected on September 4. The report comes at a time when certain stretches of the river are already showing heavy frothing, a visible proof of pollution when mixed pollutants like surfactants and phosphates are churned out to reveal their presence, even if the DPCC doesn't test those parameters. Due to the surplus monsoon this year, which retreated on October 2, the river Yamuna managed to have a good flow as additional water was released from upstream. This, however, improved the status of dissolved oxygen, which depicts the presence of life in the river, or potential, throughout its stretch. As per standards, BOD must not exceed 5 mg/l, and DO must not go below 5 mg/l, which is the standard for outdoor bathing. While BOD depicts the capacity of water to clean itself, as it is the amount of oxygen required for water to treat organic matter in it, the faecal coliform, however, represents the presence of untreated sewage in the water. According to the DPCC report, at its entry to the city at Palla, the DO level was 8 mg/l, while the BOD was 3 mg/l, and the faecal level was 1,600 unitsâall within the standards. However, as the river traversed further, the pollution load increased. By the time the river reached Wazirabad, the DO and FC were within standards; however, BOD had already breached the standards. At the ISBT bridge, the next point of analysis, both BOD and FC went beyond standards, and by the time the river reached the ITO bridge, all three major factorsâDO, BOD, and FCâwere beyond standards. The condition of the river deteriorated as FC had reached a whopping 240,000 units, BOD 23 units, while DO was 4.1 units. As the river reached Nizamuddin, the FC reached 1,100,000 units, worsening further to 3,500,000 units at Okhla, 1,100,000 units at Agra Canal, and 4,900,000 units at the cityâs exit after the confluence of Shahdara and Tughlakabad drains. Interestingly, due to the flow in the river, the DO, which in the previous month went nil or zero past the ISBT bridge, however, had some value even if it was below standard. âThe source of high faecal coliform could be untreated or inadequately treated sewage from the STPs, sewage mixing through open drains coming from unauthorised colonies, intrusion or mixing of septage, faeces of animals, etc.,â stated a senior official involved with the cleaning of the Yamuna river. Earlier in August, the highest faecal coliform level recorded was 920,000 unitsâa substantial increase from the 160,000 units observed in July. The Times of India had earlier in September, referring to another DPCC report, stated that 56% of the  sewage treatment  plants in Delhi failed to meet the standards in August, the same as earlier in July and June. The Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) mostly failed to meet the standards for TSS, BOD, COD, and faecal coliform. The sewage treated from STPs often makes its way to the river Yamuna or is often used for horticulture."
286,Nasa's Europa Clipper mission to investigate life on Jupiter's moon,"âs  Europa Clipper  spacecraft, which is robotic and solar-powered, took off on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket under clear skies. The US space agency's launched this spacecraft from Florida to investigate whether the conditions on Jupiter's moon  Europa  are suitable to support life, with a mission to focus on the large subsurface ocean that is thought to exist beneath Europa's thick outer layer of ice.  The launch, originally scheduled for last week, was delayed due to Hurricane Milton. The probe was launched aboard SpaceX's powerful Falcon Heavy rocket and is scheduled to reach Europa, one of Jupiter's numerous moons, in approximately five and a half years. After a journey of approximately 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km) over 5-1/2 years, the probe is expected to enter orbit around Jupiter in 2030.  Over the course of three years, starting in 2031, Europa Clipper is set to perform 49 close flybys of Europa, approaching as near as ""16 miles (25 kilometers)"" to the moon's surface. Operating in the vicinity of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, Europa Clipper will face a highly radioactive environment.  Jupiter is surrounded by a magnetic field that is approximately 20,000 times stronger than Earth's.  This spinning magnetic field traps and accelerates charged particles, generating radiation that could potentially damage spacecraft.  To safeguard its delicate electronics from this radiation, Nasa constructed a protective vault for the Europa Clipper using titanium and aluminum. To reach Jupiter, Nasa has equipped Europa Clipper with over 6,060 pounds (2,750 kg) of propellant.  During the launch, the spacecraft was secured inside the rocket's protective nose cone. Rather than following a direct route to Jupiter, the spacecraft will first fly by Mars and then return to Earth, utilizing the gravitational pull of each planet to gain speed, similar to a slingshot effect. The spacecraft's large solar arrays, which were stowed for the launch, will collect sunlight to power its nine scientific instruments, as well as its electronics and other subsystems. The Europa Clipper measures 30 meters (98 feet) in width when its large solar panels, designed to harness the faint light that reaches Jupiter, are fully extended. The Voyager probes captured the first close-up images of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, in 1979, revealing intriguing reddish lines across its surface, despite the moon's existence being known since 1610. In the 1990s, Nasa's Galileo probe reached Europa and discovered strong evidence suggesting the presence of an ocean on the icy moon. The Europa Clipper, equipped with a range of advanced instruments such as cameras, a spectrograph, radar, and a magnetometer, will study the moon's surface structure and composition, ocean depth, and salinity, as well as the interaction between the surface and the ocean. The mission aims to determine if the three essential elements for life - water, energy, and specific chemical compounds - are present on Europa. If these conditions are met, primitive bacteria could potentially exist in Europa's ocean, according to  Bonnie Buratti , the mission's deputy project scientist. However, these bacteria would likely be too deep for the Europa Clipper to detect directly. During a pre-launch briefing on Sunday, Nasa Associate Administrator  Jim Free  said that Europa presents one of the most promising environments for potential habitability in our solar system, aside from Earth. However, he clarified that this mission will not focus on searching for any actual living organisms. ""What we discover on Europa will have profound implications for the study of astrobiology and how we view our place in the universe,â Free added. The deputy associate administrator of Nasaâs science mission directorate,  Sandra Connelly  said: ""Scientists believe Europa has suitable conditions below its icy surface to support life. Its conditions are water, energy, chemistry and stability.â Nasa official  Gina DiBraccio , ahead of the launch said: ""With Europa Clipper, we're not searching for life on Europa, but we're trying to see if this ocean world is habitable, and that means we're looking for the water.â ""We're looking for energy sources, and we're really looking for the chemistry there, so that we can understand what habitable environments might be throughout our whole universe,"" she added. If our solar system turns out to host two habitable worlds, Europa and Earth, ""think of what that means when you extend that result to the billions and billions of other solar systems in this galaxy,"" said Niebur, the Europa Clipper program scientist. ""Setting aside the 'Is there life?' question on Europa, just the habitability question in and of itself opens up a huge new paradigm for searching for life in the galaxy,"" he added."
287,"Bihar schools closed until Sept 21 due to rising Ganga water levels, holidays declared: Official notice here"," In light of the increasing water levels in the Ganga River, the Bihar government has ordered the closure of 76 schools across the state. The decision, announced by District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh. As per the official notice, these schools will remain closed until Saturday, September 21, 2024. The schools affected are located in several blocks including Athamalgola, Badha, Bakhtiyarpur, Mokama, Sadar, Danapur, Fatuha, and Maner. These areas have been identified as being in the danger zone due to the rising water levels, and the order to close schools has been implemented immediately. According to the official notice from the Bihar Education Department, the decision to close the schools was made in accordance with Letter No. 677 dated August 24, 2024. This was issued following concerns over the potential threat to life and safety posed by the rising Ganga River, which has now crossed the danger mark. Meanwhile, the rising water levels have caused flooding in low-lying areas, exacerbating concerns for residents. The Central Water Commission has issued forecasts predicting further increases in water levels, leading the Water Resources Department to increase vigilance along embankments. Engineers and officials have been directed to patrol the affected areas at night to ensure the safety of the region."
288,Colossal 'ocean' found 700km below Earth's crust,"NEW DELHI: A scientific revelation has sparked widespread fascination across social media platforms as researchers unveil the existence of a  colossal ocean  concealed beneath the  Earth's crust , residing 700 kilometers below the planet's surface. The finding published in the 2014 scientific paper titled 'Dehydration melting at the top of the lower mantle,' has reignited curiosity about the mysteries lurking within our planet. The oceanic reservoir, within a mineral known as  ringwoodite , surpasses the combined volume of all surface oceans thrice over, presenting a challenge to our understanding of Earth's  water origins . Geophysicist  Steve Jacobsen , in the discovery team, sheds light on the unique properties of ringwoodite, describing it as a ""sponge"" with an unparalleled capacity to trap water deep within the Earth. Jacobsen said, ""I think we are finally seeing evidence for a whole-Earth water cycle, which may help explain the vast amount of liquid water on the surface of our habitable planet. Scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades."" The breakthrough came after the analysis of  seismic activity , with seismometers detecting shockwaves reverberating beneath the Earth's surface. By scrutinizing seismic data from over 500 earthquakes using a network of 2000 seismographs across the United States, researchers discerned a discernible slowing of seismic waves passing through hydrated rock, indicative of the presence of this expansive subterranean water reserve. ""The high water storage capacity of minerals in Earth's mantle transition zone (410- to 660-kilometer depth) implies the possibility of a deep H2O reservoir, which could cause dehydration and melting of vertically flowing mantle. We examined the effects of downwelling from the transition zone into the lower mantle with high-pressure laboratory experiments, numerical modelling, and seismic P-to-S conversions,"" said the scientists. ""This is substantial evidence that water on Earth came from within,"" Jacobsen asserts, underscoring the paradigm-shifting implications of the discovery. Furthermore, the findings challenge conventional theories regarding the origins of Earth's water, suggesting that it may have originated from within the planet rather than arriving via comet impacts, as previously proposed. This revelation not only captivates with its sheer magnitude but also offers a fresh perspective on Earth's water cycle, proposing that water may seep from the planet's core, gradually shaping the surface we inhabit. The implications extend beyond mere scientific curiosity, as Jacobsen highlights the significance of this reservoir in sustaining terrestrial ecosystems. Without this concealed water source, Earth's surface would be devoid of the life-sustaining liquid, fundamentally altering the planet's landscape as we know it."
289,As Kosasthalaiyar gasps for breath; govt agencies stay cold,"Chennai: Having choked  River Cooum  to death by rampant discharge of untreated sewage and turning a blind eye to encroachments, Chennai is repeating all these mistakes to take life out of Cooum's cousin â River Kosasthaiyar â which drains one-third of Chennai's water. As of now it has still some life left and it is not too late for the govt and its agencies such as the  Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust  (CRRT) and the  Water Resources Department  (WRD) to step in and save it. The CRRT has failed to propose any worthwhile project for the river for two decades now, despite spending several hundred crores of rupees for Adyar and Cooum. ""Till Manali, the river is relatively free from heavy sewage and obstructions. Reviving the floodplains here, especially in areas like Nappalayan and Vallur, could significantly increase the river's capacity. Downstream, a sewage interceptor with decentralised treatment plants could be built to tackle the pollution from Buckingham Canal,"" said T Kanthimathinathan, state disaster management coordinator. He added that nearly 50,000 encroachments need to be removed from the North B Canal. Experts also stress the need to focus on the estuary, where salt pans, mangroves, wetlands, and native species have all perished. Ennore's wetland area has shrunk from 877 hectares in 1996 to just 277 hectares in 2022, according to submissions to the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Running to 136 km from Andhra Pradesh's Ammapalli Dam,  Kosasthalaiyar  had a brush with disaster twice last year alone: an oil spill that polluted the estuary up to Manali and a severe flooding in Dec 2023, when a bund breach submerged Manali, affecting nearly 1 lakh residents. Yet, no restoration efforts have been made. The river's drainage capacity below Manali stands at a meagre 20,000 cusecs. A spot visit by TOI revealed over 1,000 encroachments along Manali's Sadayankuppam area, crowding the river's floodplains, with no flood barrier walls in place. The encroachments have reduced the river's carrying capacity from 1.1 lakh cusecs to just 60,000 cusecs beyond Manali. Last year's breach occurred with only a 40,000 cusec release from Poondi, submerging roads to Ennore Port and halting truck traffic. The river's surplus channel, stretching from the Thamaraipakkam Dam near Poondi to Cholavaram and Puzhal, is also neglected. There are no boundary walls at Madhavaram, Mathur, or along the 200-feet bypass road in Manali, and sewage continues to seep into the water. Downstream in the Ennore Estuary, high levels of pollution from fly ash and industrial chemicals have rendered the area lifeless. Dredging has not been carried out in over a decade at the estuary, with a half-submerged, rusted dredging machine near Mugathwarakuppam serving as a grim reminder. While some dredging has been done at Kattukuppam, the extracted mud piled high is ash-grey, underscoring the river's heavy pollution. Further downstream, yellow and brown chemicals continue to pour into the water near the Buckingham Canal, where sewage and industrial waste from over a dozen factories â many of them encroaching on the river's floodplains â are dumped unchecked. Despite its dire state at the estuary, experts believe Kosasthalaiyar has better restoration prospects than Chennai's other rivers like the Adyar, Cooum and the Buckingham Canal, thanks to its concentrated pollution sources. Most of the contamination begins beneath the North Buckingham Canal, which drains 10,000 cusecs of floodwater from areas like Tondiarpet, Thiruvottiyur, and Kodungaiyur. Watersheds like Ambattur, Korattur, and Retteri lakes also feed into the river, alongside the Kodungaiyur and Otteri Nullah waterways. Santha Sheela Nair, a member of the river restoration expert committee, said hefty penalties collected by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board from polluting industries should be redirected towards restoration efforts, particularly targeting fly ash and chemical pollutants. ""The surrounding environment and livelihoods that depend on the river are in ruins. We need immediate action, and we will see changes,"" she urged. Joint Chief Engineer of the Water Resources Department, C Podupanithilagam, added that plans are in place to construct four reservoirs near Poondi to conserve more water. ""Work is underway. After the last floods, we recommended building revetment walls and have blocked sewage drains in Manali. A detailed project report on the downstream restoration, prepared by the NGT expert committee, will be released soon,"" he said. MSID:: 113433715 413 | "
290,Ganga on rising trend; water enters more areas in Kashi,"Varanasi: The water level of the  Ganga  continued to rise on Monday leading to flooding of its tributary  Varuna  river and water entered more low-lying areas on the banks of the Varuna. In Ballia, the river was on a rampage as it crossed the danger mark of 57.61 metres.  The  Central Water Commission 's report on Monday morning indicated that the pace of the rise had reduced in the Ganga after it crossed the warning level of 70.26 metres on Sunday. After Monday afternoon the water level had touched the 70.76-metre mark, and the river was flowing half a metre below the danger mark of 71.26 metres. Upstream at Mirzapur, the Ganga was flowing almost half a metre below the warning level of 76.72 metres, while downstream, the river was on a rampage as it crossed the warning level of 63.10 metres in Ghazipur. In Ballia, the river is flowing one metre above the danger mark. In Varanasi, the overflowing Ganga had started flooding its tributary Varuna from Sunday, and by Monday, the floodwater had entered many low-lying areas on both the banks of the Varuna's downstream.  According to the officials, so far a population of 4,461 had been affected by  flood  of which 1,487 are farmers, 1,373 have taken shelter in their neighbourhood, while 1,601 are in relief camps. The district administration has not only ensured the distribution of cooked food, fruits, and milk, but chlorine tablets and ORS packets are also being distributed in flood-affected areas. A total of 22 boats have been engaged in distribution of the essential articles in marooned areas of the district. In Mirzapur, floodwater had entered 31 villages of tehsil Sadar and 24 of tehsil Chunar, although normal life had not been affected as the swollen Ganga had marooned only fields so far.

292,12 daily habits that eventually destroy our life,"Our everyday routines shape the course of our lives. While some habits help us grow and thrive, others silently chip away at our well-being and might become dangerous to our health. Below are 12  daily habits  that, if left unchecked, can eventually destroy our lives. A not-so-active lifestyle can be damaging in more ways than one. Lack of movement weakens muscles, slows metabolism, and increases the risk of diseases like heart problems and diabetes. Small steps like daily walks or stretching can go a long way toward being a healthy human. Water is vital for almost every bodily function. Dehydration causes fatigue, headaches, and digestive issues. Over time, inadequate  hydration  can lead to kidney problems and affect your skinâs appearance. Make it a habit to drink water regularly throughout the day. What you eat directly impacts your energy levels, mood, and long-term health. Junk food might sound amazing, but relying on those meals can result in nutrient deficiencies, weight gain, and serious illnesses like hypertension. A balanced diet full of vegetables, proteins, and healthy fats is essential for well-being. Taking care of your skin is more important than you think. Your skin is the bodyâs largest organ and acts as a barrier against harmful elements. Skipping sunscreen, failing to moisturize, and not cleansing properly can lead to premature ageing, dryness, and even skin cancer. An irregular diet throws off the body's normal rhythm. Overindulging in food after midnight or going without meals might disrupt one's metabolism, lead to stomach problems, and potentially result in weight gain. Maintain consistent mealtimes. It will support the maintenance of your energy levels and healthy metabolism. Your mindset shapes how you experience life. Constant negativity breeds stress and anxiety, which takes a toll on mental and physical health. Itâs essential to maintain positive thinking and practice gratitude. Bad  posture  doesnât just hurt your backâit affects your mood, energy, and confidence. With time, it can lead to chronic pain, breathing issues, and even digestive problems. Everyone should make sure to sit and stand properly to prevent these long-term issues. There's a reason why breakfast is known as the most significant meal of the day. It starts your metabolism and gives you the energy you need for the day. The most crucial meal should never be skipped since it might cause low energy, poor focus, and overeating in the afternoon. Lack of sleep has dangerous consequences that no one would expect. It affects everything from cognitive function to emotional regulation. Over time, poor sleep habits can increase the risk of heart disease, obesity, and depression. Chronic stress is a silent killer. It elevates cortisol levels, weakens the immune system, and increases the risk of serious health issues like heart disease and depression. Adding stress-relief practices, such as meditation or physical exercise, can significantly improve mental and physical health. Blame-shifting impedes personal development. When you blame others all the time, you miss out on opportunities to grow as a person and fail to learn from your mistakes. Growth, prosperity, and improved relationships all depend on accepting responsibility. Learning maintains mental acuity and increases mental dexterity. You run the risk of stagnating when you stop learning new things. This may hinder your growth and make it harder for you to adjust to new challenges in both your personal and professional lives. Ongoing education keeps your mind active and stimulated."
293,Kelgeri lake cries for attention,"Dharwad: Nestled amidst idyllic surroundings, the 230-acre  Kelgeri lake  has played a key role in the development of  Dharwad  and has become an integral part of its culture and has been a source of inspiration for poets and writers of the land. Dharwad, which once boasted of 41 tanks, is now left with only three tanks. Kelgeri lake, along with Sadhanakeri lake, was developed into a tourist spot in 2009-2010 by the then deputy commissioners MS Srikar and Darpan Jain. However, due to lack of proper maintenance, both Kelgeri lake and Sadhanakeri lake, surrounded by a park, are now in a dilapidated condition. Kelgeri lake is now engulfed by invasive plant Eichornia Crassipes, known as  water hyacinth , which has spread to over 70% of the water area. Water hyacinth has formed dense colonies blocking sunlight into the water and causing considerable harm to the aquatic ecosystem and the water body itself. It is considered invasive because it grows rapidly and forms a thick layer over the water. These mats shade out the other aquatic plants. Eventually, these shaded plants die and decay. According to experts, the decaying process depletes the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. As oxygen levels decline, fish struggle to survive. Often the water below the hyacinth masses become devoid of life, the experts said. This invasive plant had descended on the Kelgeri lake a decade ago, but after constant efforts by environmentalists to save the lake, govt made the lake free from water hyacinth. However, the members of  Save Kelgeri campaign  said there is no effort from any of the govt agencies to protect this lake which is a hotspot for migratory birds.The volunteers are cleaning the lake twice or thrice in a year. Noted environmentalist late Professor JC Uttangi, who had seen Dharwad during its days of ecological and cultural glory, had said the large watershed area on the eastern side of the tank which was once the catchment area has been misused for constructing a colony of concrete houses that are obstructing the inflow of rainwater.  He had suggested that steps should be taken to chop down the hilly part and push the loose earth into water to provide a suitable âLittoral zone' for the aquatic plants to grow there. A âLimonitic zone' should be left open for the sunrays to penetrate to induce plants to grow and multiply there. The zone thus created will help in attracting many rare migratory birds into the tank along this edge, Uttangi has suggested."
294,8 bird species that mate for life,"Numerous bird species worldwide look for soulmates, just like people do. These birds make permanent relationships with partners they can live out their whole lives with. A bird may, nevertheless, occasionally look for a new mate if it loses its current one. Their relationships are incredibly captivating and astounding due to their beauty and complexity. When it comes to establishing and preserving partnerships, these birds go above and beyond the minimum, frequently displaying behaviours that are intricate and captivating. Their extensive courtship rituals usually include beautiful and sophisticated calls, elaborate dances, and reciprocal expressions of caring and affection. They do these rituals in an attempt to locate and ensure their ""happily ever after. These remarkable birds demonstrate a profound commitment to their mates, showing how essential and fulfilling lifelong bonds can be. Their dedication to one another and the strength of their ties can be a moving reminder of the deep relationships found in the natural world, highlighting the unique ways in which these creatures find love and companionship. Discover the eight bird species who mate for life below. The black vulture, sometimes called the American black vulture, is found in Uruguay, Central Chile, Peru, and the Southeast United States. It can easily burrow into animal carcasses because of its short, hooked beak, and featherless, greyish-black head and neck. They take a wash following a meal, and the latitude determines when they breed. After engaging in courtship rituals, pairs form and lay their eggs in hollow logs or on the ground in forested settings. They might use metal objects, broken glass, or plastic in vibrant colours to adorn the surroundings. A fish-eating bird of prey, the Bald Eagle (sometimes called the Sea Eagle) is the largest nest-building eagle in the United States. It is America's national symbol and a lifelong partner. Bald eagles court one another with complex cries and aerial displays, and they have a high percentage of mate fidelity. They make their nests and lay their eggs in the middle of February. Their young are flung from the nest in late June or early July. They are early breeders. A species of waterfowl native to Africa and Eurasia, the mute swan was brought to North America. It is white with a prominent bump on its orange beak. The females of the species lay four to ten eggs every 36 days, and the cygnets hatch between May and July. Because they can't fly until they are 120â150 days old, young swans can only be found in the northernmost portion of their range. An incredible and uncommon species is the Whooping Crane, the tallest bird in North America. With the help of creative migration plans, wetland management techniques, and captive breeding, numbers have increased to roughly 600 now despite a drop in the 1940s. In late April or early May, the cranes lay their eggs in their nests on elevated wetlands. After around a year, the relationship between the parent and child ceases. Breeding populations spend the winter close to Rockport, Sunset Lake, Matagorda Island, Isla San Jose, and parts of the Lamar Peninsula on Texas' Gulf coast. Critically endangered, the California condor is the largest land bird in North America. Even though the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classed it as endangered, captive breeding programs have led to an increase in the species' population. The California condor has a wingspan of 9.5 feet and weighs 20 to 25 pounds. Adults have bare heads and necks and are black with a white triangle mark on them. California Condors are extremely rare birds that take six to eight years to attain sexual maturity. They are listed as endangered on Audubon's Watchlist. After mating, the birds remain together for years, if not forever. Aerial displays guide the pairs to various nest locations during courtship, which is similar to looking for a possible place to call home. Naturally, the female gets the last choice on the birds' location. Commonly referred to as Atlantic puffins, these seabirds are endemic to the Atlantic Ocean and can be found in many different nations. The IUCN has classified them as vulnerable since they are the only native puffins found in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic puffin's body and underparts are white, its cheek patches are pale grey, and its crown and back are black. It is an above-water swimmer that eats crabs, tiny fish, and zooplankton.  The species features orange legs and a large, brightly patterned red-and-black beak. The juvenile has a thinner bill and dark grey cheek patches, but the adult male and female seem the same. During the late spring breeding season, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas, where it nests in colonies atop cliffs and feeds on whole fish. They get their full flight at six weeks and leave the coast to swim. Rainbow-coloured macaws live together and prey on each other and their young. Scarlet macaws raise chicks after fledging and independence. Both male and female macaws have identical appearances. The cobalt-blue hyacinth macaw is the largest parrot, while the scarlet macaw is the best-known New World parrot. In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the monogamous Laysan Albatross is a common species of seabird. It can sail hundreds of miles a day on its remarkable six-foot span, and it couples for life. It can even glide over the broad ocean without a flap. They go through a grieving phase and a wooing dance to locate a new partner if they are lost."
295,NASA's new findings: Signs of life may be near the surface of Enceladus and Europa,"Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, are believed to have subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts that may harbour life. Recent   experiments indicate that if these oceans do support life, organic molecules like amino acids and nucleic acids might survive just below the ice surface despite intense radiation. This means that robotic landers exploring these moons might not need to dig very deep to detect these molecules. Alexander Pavlov of NASAâs Goddard Space Flight Center notes that, for Europa, amino acids could be found up to eight inches (around 20 centimetres) below the surface in areas less impacted by meteorites. On Enceladus, amino acids may survive even closer to the surface, less than a tenth of an inch (a few millimetres) from it. While the harsh surface conditions of these moons, marked by high radiation from their host planets and cosmic events, render them uninhabitable, their subsurface oceans, warmed by tidal forces, could potentially support life if they contain necessary elements and compounds. Lead author Alexander Pavlov from NASAâs Goddard Space Flight Center notes that for Europa, a sampling depth of about eight inches (20 centimetres) in relatively undisturbed areas could be sufficient to detect amino acids. In contrast, on Enceladus, these molecules could survive within just a few millimetres of the surface. The harsh surface conditions of these moons, characterised by high radiation from their planets' magnetic fields and cosmic events, make their icy exteriors inhospitable, but their subsurface oceans, heated by tidal forces, remain promising habitats for life. The research team conducted experiments to understand how amino acids might survive under these moons' conditions. By simulating Europa and Enceladus environments, they found that amino acids degrade more quickly when mixed with dust but are more stable when associated with microorganisms. This suggests that biological material might offer some protection against radiation, potentially preserving life-signalling molecules longer. These findings are crucial for designing future missions to Europa and Enceladus. Understanding where and how to sample is essential, as areas with less silica-rich dust might offer better chances for detecting preserved organic molecules. This research enhances our ability to search for life beyond Earth, providing valuable insights into where to look for signs of life in our solar system and beyond."
296,Jupiterâs icy moon Europa to be next Earth? Know the ingredients of life suggested by scientists,"Have you ever wondered if there is life beyond  Earth  but havenât found one except our Universe? But actually, how to determine the search of life beyond your home Universe? According to the scientists, they suggest that there are three core ingredients which are determined to make life easier and livable. Additionally, life requires time to develop, so one should explore worlds where sufficient time has passed for life to potentially emerge. Jupiter's icy moon Europa may contain these crucial elements and is as old as Earth.  â s  Europa Clipper  spacecraft is the one which helps to conduct an in-depth study of Europa and assess whether its subsurface ocean can support life. Understanding Europa's habitability will enhance the knowledge of the potential for life beyond our planet and guide our ongoing search. Liquid water is the primary ingredient for life, and Europa is abundant in it. Scientists believe that beneath Europaâs icy crust lies a salty ocean containing twice as much water as all of Earthâs oceans combined. Water is vital as it dissolves nutrients for organisms, facilitates chemical transport within cells, supports metabolic processes, and helps eliminate waste. Thereâs strong evidence of a rocky seafloor beneath Europa's ocean, and hydrothermal activity could provide chemical nutrients that support living organisms. Europa appears as a half-sphere against the dark backdrop of space. Its surface is off-white with a slight bluish tint, featuring long, dark rusty lines. On the left side, these lines are tightly packed, while on the right side, they extend deeper and curve across the moonâs surface. The image reveals more of the moon at the bottom, fading into darkness. This intriguing surface of Europa is showcased in a reprocessed colour image derived from photographs taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. The best evidence for an ocean beneath Europa was gathered by the Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Although Europa lacks its own magnetic field, the Galileo spacecraft detected a magnetic signature during 12 close flybys, likely caused by a global ocean of salty water beneath its surface. Europaâs bright, icy exterior is unlike any found on Earth. It is the smoothest body in the solar system, with few mountains or deep basins. The surface is crisscrossed by ridges and grooves, and many features align with long, dark reddish streaks stretching over 600 miles (1,000 kilometres). Additionally, domes, pits, and clusters of icy blocks suggest warm ice may be rising from below. Images of Europa's surface reveal patterns of cracks and ridges indicative of a global ocean capable of producing large tides that deform the surface. The largest impact structures on Europa show concentric patterns, suggesting that impacts may have breached the icy shell into liquid water. Moreover, the moonâs surface geology indicates that warm ice has likely risen from the ice-ocean interface. Models propose that Europa's icy shell is stretched and released by Jupiter's gravitational pull as the moon orbits the giant planet. This phenomenon, known as tidal flexing, generates internal heat within Europa, possibly maintaining the liquid ocean beneath its surface. In addition to water, life as we know it requires specific chemical elementsâsuch as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphurâthat are fundamental building blocks. These elements are abundant in the universe and constitute 98% of living matter on Earth, combining to form organic molecules essential for life. Scientists believe these elements were incorporated into Europa during its formation and were later augmented by organic materials from colliding asteroids and comets. While all life on Earth is composed of organic molecules, simply discovering these molecules does not necessarily indicate the presence of life. They can form through non-biological processes as well. However, finding such molecules on Europa would help determine whether the essential ingredients for life ever existed on the icy moon. Some of these vital chemical elements may currently reside within Europaâs icy shell, while others could originate from its core and the weathering of the moon's rocky interior. Tidal flexing may facilitate the cycling of water and nutrients among the moon's rocky interior, icy shell, and ocean, creating a chemically rich aquatic environment conducive to life. The third vital ingredient for life is energy, which all living organisms require. On Earth, most energy comes from the Sun, with plants harnessing sunlight through photosynthesis to produce energy. This energy is then transferred to humans, animals, and other organisms when they consume plants. However, any potential life forms on Europa would likely depend on chemical reactions rather than photosynthesis, as they would exist beneath the ice, far from sunlight. Europa's surface is bombarded by radiation from Jupiter, making it inhospitable for surface life. Yet, this radiation might create energy sources for life within the ocean below. The radiation can break down water molecules (HâO) in Europa's thin atmosphere, allowing hydrogen to escape while much of the oxygen remains, potentially bonding with other elements. This reactive oxygen could facilitate chemical reactions that release energy, possibly supporting microbial life if it reaches the ocean. Additionally, Europaâs ocean is likely in direct contact with warm rock at its seafloor. As Europa orbits Jupiter, its interior flexes, generating heat (similar to how bending a paperclip produces heat). The more the moon flexes, the more heat is generated, which can provide hydrogen and other chemicals to the ocean. If the rocky ocean floor is heated by tidal flexing, it could supply energy in the form of chemical nutrients through hydrothermal vents. This process is analogous to what occurs in hydrothermal vents on Earth, first discovered in 1977 on the Galapagos Rift in the Pacific Ocean. These discoveries revolutionised our understanding of life on Earth and are considered among the most significant breakthroughs in ocean science."

298,"Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus Tata Sons & billionaire of hearts, passes away: Life, education, business career milestones & timeline of Indiaâs industry giant","Ratan Naval Tata, a titan of industry who never sought the spotlight, passed away on Wednesday night at a Mumbai hospital at the age of 86. Despite his immense influence and control over more than 30 companies operating in over 100 countries across six continents,   lived a modest life and never appeared on any list of billionaires. Ratan Tata joined the family firm after acquiring a B.S. in architecture from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, in 1962. He started his career by working on the shop floor, acquiring hands-on experience across different   businesses.  In 1971, he was appointed director-in-charge of National Radio and Electronics Co. (Nelco), one of the groupâs companies. He became chairman of Tata Industries a decade later and in 1991, took over as the chairman of the Tata Group from his uncle, JRD, who had been in charge for more than half a century. Tata's ascension to the role of chairman coincided with India's economic liberalization in 1991. Under his leadership, the Tata Group, which had humble beginnings as a small textile and trading firm in 1868, transformed into a global powerhouse with diverse operations ranging from salt and steel to cars, software, power plants, and airlines. Ratan Tata led   for over two decades, during which the group pursued aggressive expansion. Also Read |  Under his leadership, Tata Sons acquired several high-profile companies, including Tetley Tea for $431.3 million in 2000, Daewoo Motors' truck-manufacturing operations for $102 million in 2004, Corus Group for $11.3 billion, and Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Company for $2.3 billion. In December 2012, he handed over control of Tata Sons to his then-deputy, Cyrus Mistry. However, disagreements arose over Mistry's leadership, leading to his removal in October 2016, marking the end of the first non-Tata family member's tenure as chairman. Ratan Tata was among the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on various projects, including the decision to discontinue the loss-making small car, Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata. Following Mistry's removal, Tata took on the role of interim chairman from October 2016 until January 2017, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed as the new chairman of the Tata Group.  Since then, Ratan Tata has been serving as the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. Also Read |  In recent years, Ratan Tata has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs and investing in tech-driven start-ups that have the potential to shape the future of the country.  Through his personal investments and his investment company, RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in more than 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame."

300,Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma: Will bring law to give life term for 'love jihad' & another to halt 'land jihad',"GUWAHATI: BJP-governed   is ready with a proposed  law  mandating life imprisonment for anyone convicted of "" "", CM   said Sunday, less than a week after the UP assembly passed a Bill amending the state's 2021 anti-conversion legislation to increase the punishment for offences linked to marriage or elopement from the current maximum 10-year jail term to life. A law requiring prior chief ministerial consent for land-related transactions between Hindus and Muslims is also in the works to halt what Sarma labelled "" land jihad "". ""We spoke about love jihad during the elections. It is a real and serious issue, involving forced conversions and deceitful romantic relationships. In the next few days, we aim to take steps to make this punishable with a life sentence,"" the CM said If a Muslim wants to buy a Hinduâs property or a Hindu wants to buy a Muslimâs property, it will be subject to scrutiny, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said at  âs state executive meeting in Guwahati. Besides Uttar Pradesh in 2021, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh have enacted anti-conversion laws with separate and stricter clauses against change in religion deemed to linked to âlove jihadâ. In Assam, BJP-led govt last month moved to repeal Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorce Registration Act and Rules of 1935, which permitted underage marriages under specific conditions. CM Sarma mentioned at the BJP meeting that his govt viewed âland jihadâ as a serious threat to the stateâs demography and had al-ready reclaimed encroached areas through a series of eviction campaigns. He said a span equivalent to the size of Chandigarh had been freed from encroachment by people from a particular community. BJP is committed to protecting every right of the indigenous people of the state, the CM said. âWe will have a new law to protect land in historically and culturally important regions like Barpeta, Majuli, and Batadrava so that only the people from those places can purchase property there.â Sarma said the delimitation exercise last year was a crucial step towards safeguarding the stateâs future. On CAA, Sarma mentioned the âlimited impactâ of the agitation against the law. âBringing CAA was a brave step by BJP govt. We are going to initiate a process to unlock biometrics of people that were blocked,â he said."
301,The fish that can live without water and can walk on land,"In the intertidal zones of the Indo-Pacific region, stretching from the eastern coast of Africa to the islands of the Pacific Ocean, lives a creature that defies the conventional boundaries of  aquatic life . These areas, characterized by their fluctuating tides and muddy shores, provide a challenging habitat for marine life. Yet, this fish has not only adapted to these conditions but has also developed the ability to move on land. This ability is particularly useful during low tide when the water recedes, leaving behind vast expanses of mudflats. The fish in question is the  mudskipper , a member of the Gobiidae family. Mudskippers are  amphibious fish  that can breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth and throat, a process known as cutaneous respiration. This adaptation allows them to survive out of water for extended periods. They are also equipped with strong pectoral fins that enable them to âwalkâ on land, making them one of the few fish capable of  terrestrial locomotion . Mudskippers are known for their distinctive behavior and physical characteristics. They can often be seen hopping or skipping across the mudflats, hence their name. Their bulging eyes, which can move independently, provide them with a wide field of vision, crucial for spotting predators and prey. These eyes are adapted to see both in and out of water, giving mudskippers a significant advantage in their dual habitats. The diet of mudskippers is as varied as their habitat. They feed on a range of organisms, including small fish, crustaceans, and insects. Their ability to hunt both in water and on land makes them versatile predators. Mudskippers are also known for their territorial behavior. Males often engage in elaborate displays to attract females and ward off rivals, including raising their dorsal fins and performing acrobatic jumps. Mudskippers have been the subject of numerous studies due to their unique  adaptations . Researchers have explored their  respiratory mechanisms , locomotion, and behavior to understand how these fish have evolved to thrive in such challenging environments. Studies have shown that mudskippers can survive out of water for up to two days, provided their skin remains moist. This remarkable endurance is a celebration of just how extraordinary nature is. The presence of mudskippers in various parts of the world highlights the incredible diversity of life on our planet. From the mangrove forests of Southeast Asia to the coastal regions of Africa, these fish have carved out a niche for themselves in some of the most dynamic and challenging ecosystems. Their ability to live both in water and on land serves as a reminder of the adaptability and resilience of nature."
302,10 easy ways to reduce plastic pollution; the impact and reasons of reducing plastic pollution,"Plastic pollution  has become a significant global environmental issue, affecting ecosystems both on land and in the oceans. With millions of tons of plastic waste generated each year, much of it ends up in waterways, where it threatens  marine life  and pollutes natural habitats. Plastics take hundreds of years to break down, during which time they release toxic chemicals and fragments into harmful microplastics. These tiny particles are ingested by wildlife, contaminating food chains and ecosystems. As plastic production continues to grow, addressing this   through reduction, recycling, and responsible waste management is crucial for the health of our planet. While enjoying the soothing rhythm of waves on the beach, it's hard to face the fact that the ocean has turned into a massive pool of garbage, primarily filled with plastic. Sadly, millions of tons of debris are floating in the water, posing a serious risk to marine life. According to a study published in Science, the equivalent of 136 billion milk jugsâ worth of trash enters the ocean every year. This relentless flood of waste entangles animals or ends up being ingested as it breaks into microplastics. Worse yet, plastic pollution in the ocean is nearly impossible to reverse, taking centuries to decompose and leaking harmful chemicals in the meantime. Shockingly, about 80% of this pollution originates from land, not from people dumping waste at sea."
303,Bad road forces villagers to trek 12km to reach shelters in Odisha amid Cyclone Dana,"Around 220  villagers  from sea erosion-hit  Satabhaya  and Magarkandha villages within  Bhitarkanika National Park  walked approximately 12 km to reach the cyclone shelters at  Bagapatia  and Okilapala. Jagabandhu Behera (46), a villager, said the muddy and narrow road from Satabhaya to the cyclone shelters is not suitable for vehicles.  ""That is why we had to walk to the shelters to save our lives from the onslaught of  . The trek also included crossing the crocodile-infested Bausagali river,"" said Jagabandhu, after arriving at the  cyclone shelter  in Bagapatia. Asked about the complaint, Ajay Kumar Mohanty, the tehsildar of  Rajnagar  said, ""They had to trek as condition of the road is not good. After reaching the cyclone shelters, they were provided with food, water and medicines.""  Jagabandhu's wife Manorama (40) had to be forced to leave the village. ""I did not want to leave behind the 20 goats and two cows. But officials and our sarpanch forced us to leave Satabhaya. I untied the cows but locked the goats in a pen to protect them from jackals. We hope the tidal waves will spare our goats as they are a source of livelihood for us,"" said Manorama. ""The sea has been inching closer every day. Not much is left of our village. Many families have left the village and settled in Bagapatia. But I am happy the govt has provided us shelter at Bagapatia cyclone shelter to save our lives from Dana,"" said Duryodhan Mallick (63) of Satabhaya. ""Being a resident of the remote Satabhaya village, life is very difficult. But now I am quite happy as the administration shifted me to the cyclone shelter at Bagapatia,"" said Akhila Behera (50) of Satabhaya. The 12-km-long stretch of the beach in Satabhaya gram panchayat is often said to be the 'fastest-eroding' beach on the state's coast.  More than 600 homes and large tracts of  agricultural land  have been wiped away by the advancing waters in the last 40 years. Satabhaya GP used to be a cluster of seven villages.  Now, only a small portion of Satabhaya remains. Six other villages - Gobindapur, Mohanpur, Chintamanipur, Badagahiramatha, Kanhupur, and Kharikula - have been swallowed by the sea. "
304,"Fish Walk: Students, professionals âdive intoâ marine life",": The inaugural  Fish Walk , a public outreach program organized by the  CMFRI , offered a unique opportunity for students and professionals from diverse fields to witness firsthand the wide variety of fish that landed at Munambam fishing harbor on Saturday. The participants were guided by scientists and staff from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), who arrived early in the morning. At Munambam harbour, they witnessed fish landings from nine trawlers, featuring a diverse catch that included large-head and small-head hairtails (ribbonfish), cuttlefish, squid, bullseyes, Indian scad, pufferfish, and numerous species brought in for the fish meal industry. Led by Miriam Paul Sreeram, principal scientist and coordinator of the initiative, the CMFRI teamâcomprising Ratheesh Kumar R, Aju Raju, Sreekumar K M, and Sajikumar K Kâprovided detailed insights into  marine biodiversity . Participants not only enjoyed a firsthand view of the variety of  marine life  but also learned about the use of gill baskets from rays in Asian medicine and the application of fish maw (air bladders from eels and croakers) in food and wine-making industries. In total, the team documented 42 fish species, 5 cephalopods, and 2 types of shrimp, sparking significant interest among the attendees. Notably, landings were moderate on Saturday morning due to recent inclement weather. ""The Fish Walk has generated remarkable interest across the community, attracting participants ranging from primary school students to defence and police officials, homemakers, seafood industry workers, accountants, medical practitioners, college faculty, and even seniors in their seventies,"" said Miriam. ""All applicants will be accommodated in future Fish Walks. The next event is scheduled for Oct 26, with a trip to Chellanam for 25 participants. We are also planning special expeditions for researchers. Schools and colleges in Ernakulam and other districts have expressed a keen interest in participating,"" she added."
305,"Exploring black garden queen ants: Their habitat, diet, and why they eat their own larvae","The black garden queen ( Lasius niger ) ant plays a crucial role in the survival and growth of her colony. As the sole reproducer, she is responsible for laying thousands of eggs throughout her life, ensuring the colonyâs expansion. Distinguished by her large size and long lifespanâup to 15 yearsâthe queen is a fascinating figure in the ant world. After a single mating flight, where she stores sperm for life, the queen devotes herself to producing offspring. Her diet, mostly supplied by worker ants, includes sugars, proteins, and, surprisingly, sometimes her own infected larvae. This cannibalistic behaviour is not only a defence mechanism against dangerous fungal infections but also helps recycle nutrients for future generations. Explore the queenâs unique adaptations, including her physical traits, mating process, habitat, and remarkable behaviour. Queen ants are significantly larger than worker ants, making them easy to distinguish in a colony. The black garden ant queen can grow up to 15 millimetres, nearly twice the size of a typical worker. Queens initially have wings, which they shed after mating to establish a new colony. Their bodies are robust and specialised for reproduction, with a larger thorax and abdomen, housing the reproductive organs. Once settled, the queen remains in the nest for the rest of her life, focusing on laying eggs and producing thousands of offspring. The mating process of the black garden ant queen is known as the ""nuptial flight."" On warm summer days, virgin queens and male ants leave their colonies en masse. Mating occurs mid-air during this flight. Afterward, the males die, and the queen lands to find a suitable location for her new colony. She sheds her wings and lays her first set of eggs, nurturing them until they hatch into worker ants. She stores sperm from the mating flight in a special organ and uses it to fertilise eggs throughout her life, eliminating the need for future mating. Queen ants live far longer than their worker counterparts. The black garden ant queen has a lifespan of up to 15 years, while worker ants typically only live for a few months. This extraordinary longevity allows the queen to produce thousands of offspring during her lifetime, ensuring the colonyâs continuity. Queen ants primarily consume the same types of food as their workers. Their diet consists of sugars and proteins. In particular, they rely on:  A sugary liquid secreted by aphids, which ants ""farm"" by protecting aphids from predators. Insects: Worker ants bring back protein-rich food like insects to feed the queen and larvae. : In certain cases, as we'll explore below, queens consume infected or dead larvae to recycle nutrients. The diet of a queen is essential to sustain her energy and enable her to produce a constant supply of eggs for the colony. Workers feed her throughout her life, ensuring she has the sustenance needed to maintain her reproductive role. Black garden ants thrive in temperate climates and are commonly found in gardens, grasslands, and urban areas. Queens establish colonies underground, often beneath stones or within decaying wood. The nest features a complex system of tunnels and chambers, where the queen resides in a deep, protected chamber. Once the colony is established, the queen rarely leaves the nest, entrusting the worker ants with gathering food and defending the colony. One of the more shocking behaviours observed in black  queen ants  is their tendency to eat their own larvae. But this act is not random or cruelâit serves a critical purpose in the survival of the colony. Black garden ant larvae can sometimes become infected by a deadly fungus. If allowed to spread, the fungus can quickly infect the entire colony, killing all larvae and putting the queen at an 80% risk of death. To combat this, queens have evolved an extraordinary behaviour: cannibalism of infected larvae. When a larva becomes infected and cannot be saved, the queen kills and eats it. By doing so, she removes the threat to the rest of the colony while recycling the nutrients in the infected larva. These nutrients are then used to produce new, healthy offspring. Interestingly, queens do not become infected by consuming the larvae. Ants have a special venom gland that produces an acidic, antimicrobial substance. This venom is typically used to clean the nest or ward off predators. When consuming the infected larvae, queens groom themselves with this venom, likely using its antimicrobial properties to neutralise the fungus and protect themselves from infection. How does the queen know which larvae are infected? While this is not fully understood, researchers believe that infected larvae send chemical signals that trigger the queenâs behaviour. Essentially, the larvae signal to the queen that they pose a danger to the colony, prompting her to consume them. Though this may seem gruesome, it is a highly evolved survival strategy. Since only queens reproduce, it is in the infected larvaâs best genetic interest to sacrifice itself for the good of the colony and the queenâs continued survival."

310,Watch: Young Sheldon scene that predicted reality about SpaceX catching its rocket featuring Elon Musk,"While ""The Simpsons"" is famed for its eerie ability to predict future events, it seems ""Young Sheldon"" has now entered the same realm of prophetic television. In a particular scene from the show,  young Sheldon  explains complex  rocket landing  maneuversâyears before  , led by  , accomplished a strikingly similar feat. In the episode, Sheldon describes how a rocket could be flipped and landed using a  PID controller , but the doctor heâs speaking with dismisses it as a theoretical concept, stating that the technology simply doesnât exist to execute it. Sheldon confidently replies, ""So I'm ahead of my time."" The show also pokes fun at Elon Musk, showing him stealing ideas from a book by young Sheldon and passing them off as his own. Fast forward to reality, and SpaceX has indeed caught up with Sheldonâs visionary explanation. On Sunday, SpaceX achieved a significant breakthrough by successfully catching the booster of its Starship rocket using mechanical arms, a move SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called âscience fiction without the fiction part.â The booster, after launching from Texas, was deftly caught by the metal arms dubbed âchopsticksâ attached to the launch tower. The achievement marks a critical milestone in Muskâs ambitious plan to make humanity a multiplanetary species. Elon Musk took to X, formerly Twitter, exclaiming, âThe tower has caught the rocket!! Big step towards making life multiplanetary was made today.â The accomplishment triggered celebrations at SpaceX headquarters and NASA, with SpaceX employees cheering as the booster was secured. Much like Sheldonâs theoretical vision in ""Young Sheldon,"" SpaceXâs success in catching its booster represents a leap in engineering. Musk's vision for reusable rockets has become a reality, paving the way for future missions to the moon and Mars. "
311,Mallikarjun Kharge's family trust recalls land plea amid Siddaramaiah wife's plot row,"BENGALURU: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's family-run trust Sunday withdrew an approved request for a five-acre site within Bengaluru's Aerospace Park for a proposed "" multi-skill development centre "", less than a fortnight after Karnataka CM  's wife surrendered 14 plots amid an investigation into her land-swap deal with Mysore Urban Development Authority (Muda). ""We withdraw our proposal and request the board to cancel the allotment of the CA (civic amenities) site, per Clause 8 of the allotment letter,"" Rahul Kharge, one of the AICC chief's sons and chairperson of Siddhartha Vihar Trust, said in a letter to the CEO of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. The site was allotted to the trust in March, prompting BJP to accuse the Congress govt of favouring the party president's family. The trustees include Kharge, his wife Radhabai, elder son and minister Priyank Kharge, son-in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani, and Rahul. ""An educational institute cannot function effectively while facing mala fide, baseless, and politically motivated allegations... We do not wish to be drawn into controversies that will divert our attention and efforts from our primary objective of empowering the disempowered through education and social service,"" states the letter to the board. While the request for land had been approved, the site was still to be handed over to the trust, sources said. Defending his brother's decision, Priyank said BJP tried to create ""a needless controversy"" and the family decided to step back rather than make an issue of it. The Kharge family had been stoutly defending the  land allotment  until recently. ""Rahul is a mild-mannered person who does not know how to counter these politically-motivated allegations, unlike us who are in public life. Siddhartha Vihar Trust is an educational, cultural, and charitable trust, and not a family or private entity,"" Priyank said, also taking a dig at Union home minister Amit Shah without naming him. ""The irony is that a person who cannot hold a bat can become the chairman of ICC or BCCI when BJP governs at the Centre, but a person (Rahul) who was conferred Agni Award by DRDO for excellence in self-reliance cannot build a skill development centre for the youth. So, he felt bad and decided to return the plot."" BJP MP Lahar Singh Siroya wrote on social media that he felt vindicated by the Kharge family's decision to return the land. ""When I raised this issue, I was threatened and abused by Kharge Jr and his cronies. Truth has prevailed,"" he said. The legislator suggested that since Siddaramaiah was on shaky ground, the return of land could even be a ploy to gain moral advantage. ""This may be a tactical move to seek the CM's chair,"" he said BJP had called for a CBI investigation into the land allotment and petitioned the governor to dismiss Priyank from the state cabinet. When the controversy broke, CM Siddaramaiah had said, ""The allotment has been done in accordance with law. Their trust is eligible, so we have done it."""

The restaurant staff had mistakenly mixed  caustic soda  in the fennel instead of sugar crystals (mishri), which caused severe burns and blisters in the woman's mouth. Acting on the complaint of the woman's brother, Piplani police on Monday registered a case against the errant hotel staff under section 125b (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of BNS and started investigations. The woman's condition was stated to be stable, and she has since been shifted from ICU. Investigation officer SI Santosh Raghuvanshi said the complainant, Vishnu Pandey, a resident of Khajuri Kalan, said that on Sunday night, after celebrating Karwa Chauth, he and his family members went to a hotel in Patel Nagar. After finishing their meal, Vishnu's sister Rani ate some fennel kept at the restaurant's reception and immediately felt a severe burning sensation in her mouth.  Her mouth became swollen and painful sores appeared. Alarmed, Vishnu confronted the receptionist, demanding to know what was in the saunf. Upon inspecting the containers, hotel employee Rahul Malviya discovered that he mistakenly placed caustic soda in the fennel mixture, thinking it was sugar crystals, the SI said. Vishnu rushed Rani to a nearby private hospital, where she was admitted to the ICU for treatment. Vishnu returned to the hotel and inquired about the name of the employee responsible for this. Police have registered a case against Malviya for  negligence . Rani is still undergoing treatment, and further investigations are underway. "
314,Delhi may soon get first vehicle scrapping unit,"New Delhi: The capital is likely to get a  registered vehicle scrapping facility  (RVSF) to dismantle  overaged vehicles  in a scientific manner. At its recent meeting, the  Delhi Pollution Control Committee  categorised vehicle dismantling units as an orange category industry and said it would give consent to any private entity planning to operate such units. Officials said DPCC would authorise these units under various rules, including those on the management of hazardous waste, e-waste and plastic waste. At present, Delhi has no such scrapping units. To reduce vehicular pollution, the transport department is acting against  end-of-life vehicles  (ELVs) and sending the seized ones to RVSF in the neighbouring states. All petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles more than 10 years old are considered ELVs. The Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal have directed that registration and plying or deemed plying (parked in public space) of ELVs must be restricted. At its board meeting on Sept 27, DPCC observed, ""It was decided that in view of the age limits prescribed by the central govt for deregistering overaged vehicles, the number of vehicles to be scrapped in a scientific manner is increasing. The committee is of the view that if such facilities are not allowed in Delhi, illegal units will flourish in residential or non-conforming areas without any pollution control. As the activity is a service industry and also helps in the circular economy, consent may be granted to such units in approved industrial areas."" RVSFs will be an orange category industry in Delhi. Based on the level of pollution involved, CPCB categorises industry in four colours â red, orange, white and green, the last being least polluting. A DPCC official said since there is a plan to impound ELVs on a large scale this winter and given the jump in electric vehicles, the board decided to permit RVSFs in Delhi. ""Any private entity with access to land in an industrial area and capital can apply for consent to operate. Monitoring of air and water in the locality, especially for lead, will be undertaken by DPCC,"" said the official. Out of around 50 lakh ELVs in the city, 15,401 have been impounded so far in 2023 and 2024. The Commission for Air Quality Management informed the Supreme Court that although harvest stubble burning has reduced by half in the last three years, the large fleet of ELVs in these states accentuated the pollution. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""A well-organised scrappage infrastructure is an integral part of any fleet renewal policy and schemes to replace the older vehicles with new and e-vehicles. While this can reduce emissions from the older and polluting vehicles, it also helps recover material from the old fleet for reuse while preventing toxic contamination of the environment."" Roychowdhury added that even as the scrappage infrastructure was expanded, efficient implementation had to ensure proper identification of all ELVs and that they reached RVSFs. "
315,Man gets life term for murder of Indian-origin restaurant manager in UK's Reading,"Pakistan-born  Shazeb Khalid ,25, who was found guilty of murdering  Indian restaurant manager  Vignesh Pattabhiraman on February 14 has been sentenced to life in jail in Britain and will serve a minimum of 21 years behind bars. At  Reading crown court  this week, Khalid's friend Soiheem Hussain, 27, was sentenced to four years in prison for assisting the offender. The jury was told Hussain had brokered a Â£2,000 'contract fee' for Khalid to murder Raman on behalf of the restaurant management. Vignesh, an Indian citizen from IOB Colony near Marudhamalai, Coimbatore, was deliberately hit by Khalid in his car when he was cycling home from Vel, a South Indian restaurant in Reading. Khalid then assaulted him as he lay injured on the ground. Raman died a few hours later in hospital. It was Raman's penultimate day working at Vel. He had landed a new job at the Hyatt Regency London - the Churchill. Khalid, who moved from Pakistan to the UK in 2007 told the court he had been paid to ""threaten and scare"" Raman by Hussain who had received the ""job"" from ""either the restaurant owner or manager"" because Raman was suspected of reporting Vel to the Home Office for hiring illegal staff leading to a Â£20,000 penalty, paid by the director of Vel, Fathima Razack, on February 16, 2023. Vignesh had moved to Reading with his wife, Ramya, in Dec 2022, on a skilled worker visa. Ramya told the court in a witness impact statement that he had been working at a hotel in Qatar when he received an offer to work in a hotel in Colorado, USA, but turned it down to work in the UK as they ""thought it was safer"". She said the new job he landed in London was ""the job of his dreams"". Ramanâs murder led to her losing her spousal visa and her right to work in the UK and she has returned to India to live with her parents, the Reading Chronicle reported.  ""Vignesh was a kind man who moved to the UK on the promise of a job providing opportunity and hope for him and his wife, Ramya. He was killed on a misguided belief that he was responsible for instigating an investigation into Vel restaurant employing illegal immigrants,"" said senior investigating officer detective chief inspector Stuart Brangwin. ""I can only hope that the sentences passed provide some relief for Vignesh's family."""

321,Pakistan rolls out red carpet for Zakir Naik: Is Islamabad setting stage for another conflict with India?,"NEW DELHI:  , a controversial  Islamic evangelist  who is wanted in India on  terror-linked charges , landed in Islamabad on October 1 with   Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcoming the fugitive with wide arms and cosy hugs. Pakistan's move to roll out the red carpet for Naik, who is there for a month-long visit, reek of mischief by the Sharif dispensation with the objective of opening up a new front of confrontation with India, which has virtually suspended its bilateral relations with Islamabad since the 2017 Uri and 2019 Pulwama terror attacks. India had carried out surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes in response to these terror attacks. The tension between India and Pakistan was palpable at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting last week, when external affairs minister S Jaishankar tore into Islamabad and warned that its ""cross-border terrorism policy can and will never succeed"". In a strong-worded reply to Pakistani  PM Shehbaz Sharif 's UNGA speech where he accused New Delhi of ""escalating tensions"" in Kashmir, Jaishankar warned that Islamabad's ""actions will most certainly have consequences"". In the backdrop of such strained relations, Pakistan's invitation to Zakir Naik has raised eyebrows, with some experts of the view that the fugitive's visit is likely planned to fuel tension between the two nations. ""As a purveyor of hate speech, Zakir Naik has been banned from several countries including India. In giving him a royal reception, Pakistan is announcing that it is committed to embracing fundamentalism and is willing to set aside global opinion,"" social activist Pervez Hoodbhoy told Deutsche Welle. Amit Ranjan, a research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, said: ""As Pakistan is already facing violence related to social and political problems, giving space to Naik is nothing but an addition to the existing tensions."" In Naik's Pakistan visit, the only silver lining perhaps is that it provides New Delhi with a fresh opportunity to justify its claims that the neighbouring country continues to welcome and facilitate ""anti-India"" elements. ""There is a lesson in this invitation to Zakir Naik for those who advocate some diplomatic opening towards Pakistan, be it in sports, trade etc. Even reviving SAARC. The NC and PDP in Kashmir want India to talk to Pakistan. Shehbaz Sharifâs speech at the UN was intemperate. Linked Kashmir to Palestine, talked of Indiaâs colonial settlement project in Kashmir and the Islamophobic Hindu supremacist agenda in India. Not a discourse intended to lower tensions with India. Shehbaz may get âshabashâ domestically but wonât improve Pakistan's condition. Jaishankar gave a befitting reply in the UNGA to Sharif,"" Kanwal Sibal, former Indian foreign secretary, wrote on X. The controversial ""televangelist"" has been living in Malaysia since India's anti-terror agency launched an investigation against him in 2016. Naik has been accused of promoting radical views similar to those of groups like the Islamic State and the Taliban, leading to bans on his speeches in India, Bangladesh, Canada and the United Kingdom. Naik has delivered over 1,500 public lectures since 1994, often asserting that Islam is the only true religion and criticising other faiths, as well as non-Wahhabi Islamic sects such as Shias, Sufis, and Barelvis. Naik is the founder of  Peace TV , a channel on comparative religion with a reported audience of over 100 million. It faces a ban in India in connection with alleged money laundering and hate speeches.  India also banned   in 2016, accusing it of encouraging followers to promote enmity and hatred. He fled India in July 2016 after Bangladeshi authorities claimed that one of the attackers on a cafe in Dhaka was inspired by Zakir Naik. The incident had left 22 people dead.  The   filed a charge sheet under Section 10 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, which has been replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The investigation revealed that Naik is the founding trustee and a member of an ""unlawful association"" â IRF."
322,SC's collegium mulled transfer of Karnataka judge,"NEW DELHI:  's top five judges, part of the  collegium  for transfer of HC judges and comprised the bench that had taken suo motu cognisance of  Justice V Srishananda 's unwarranted gratuitous remarks, had mulled transferring him outside Karnataka HC. Between September 20, when the bench of  CJI D Y Chandrachud , and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy took cognisance of  Justice Srishananda 's remarks, and Sept 25, when it admonished him prior to closing the case, the collegium comprising the same five judges had weighed the option of shifting the judge outside his parent HC. As the Karnataka HC Registrar General's Sept 23 report, prepared in consultation with the HC chief justice N V Anjaria, referred to many past gratuitous and unwarranted observations of Justice Srishananda, the five-member Collegium deliberated on the option of shifting the judge to another HC to register SC's strong objection to such remarks. Interestingly, a day after the SC took suo motu cognisance of Justice Srishananda's June 6 gender insensitive remark and Aug 28 illogical reference to a Bengaluru locality as 'part of Pakistan', the judge during the post-lunch session of court proceedings on Sept 21 said that his observations were unintentional and tendered apology in open court. The regret and promise to mend his ways crept into deliberations of the collegium, with some judges opposing transfer proposal on three grounds - Justice Srishananda has realised and regretted his mistake and this, along with the clarification that he did not wish to hurt any individual or community and apology tendered suo motu should be treated as mitigating factors.  They also cautioned that a transfer would become a precedent warranting transfer of all the outspoken judges as well as an incentive for the vigilantes who would be encouraged to pluck a seemingly controversial remark and wrench it from the context to set up a campaign against judges they don't like. The reservations saw the Collegium failing to reach unanimity on whether to transfer Justice Srishananda leading them to settle suo motu  judicial proceedings  being taken to the logical conclusion on Sept 25. Taking a larger view even as they admonished the erring judge, the five-judge bench Wednesday laid down basic parameters for a judge's conduct in a courtroom saying they, as well as all stakeholders including lawyers, should be mindful of what they say in a courtroom as live telecast and video conferencing facilities reach the judicial proceedings to a vast audience beyond the courtrooms. The bench closed the proceedings saying, ""Courts therefore have to be careful not to make comments which may be construed as misogynistic or prejudicial to certain sections of our society... We emphasise this point, as it is necessary for every stakeholder in the institution to understand that the values which must not die are the values enshrined in the Constitution (Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity)."""
323,"Women Safety, Call For Justice Echo At Hyderabadâs Durga Pandals","In the wake of the R G Kar incident, the  Bengali community  in Hyderabad has adapted women empowerment and safety, as their theme for this year's   festivities. If some pandals are seeing women lead traditional rituals, others are using art to create awareness about the need for women's protection. As a tribute to the victim of the heinous crime, a few have also decided to keep their celebrations low-key. Show of strength, unity To drive home a powerful message about the strength of women, the  Cyberabad Bangali Association  in Miyapur had about a 100 women members collectively blow the shankh (conch shell) to mark the onset of  , on Tuesday evening. Dressed in colourful attire, they gathered around the Durga idol â united in their fight for women's rights. ""The shankh dhwani is usually performed to welcome the goddess on Panchami (fifth day of the festival), but this year it also calls for justice for the RG Kar victim,"" said Swarnashree Saha Chatterjee, who led the women's group that gathered to welcome the goddess. The association has also invited a team of women cooks from West Bengal for the festival this year, who will prepare bhog (prasadam) for thousands of devotees visiting the pandal over the next few days. ""It's our way of upholding the notion of women's empowerment through tradition,"" said Subhro Mukherjee, general secretary of the association. In the driver's seat  While women have always played a key part in the Durga Puja organised by the Hyderabad Bangalee Samity, who have been hosting puja for the past 83 years â the oldest in the city â this year they have taken centre stage. And that's also to symbolically reinstate their position in society, where women are often frontrunners. ""If we can run homes and offices, we can very well organise a Durga Puja,"" said Mousami Chowdhuri, first woman president of the association referring to the all-women leadership team that's been set up, for the first time, to organise this event at NTR Gardens. Chowdhari also shared how the festival will see 50 women come together for the traditional dhunuchi dance, a devotional offering to the goddess. ""The dance, combined with the harmonious sound of the conch, represents the strength of women,"" said Joy Kumar Dutta, general secretary of the association adding how after the RG Kar incident, it's imperative for all communities to rally for women's safety. ""This Puja is not just a tribute to the RG Kar victim but to all women who have faced injustice in their lives,"" he said. Using art to depict challenges Amid the dhak-dhol (drums) and bhog, the walls of the pandal in Masab Tank, organised by the Bengalee Cultural Association, will ensure that every person walking in is educated about the gaps in women's safety â strongly reinforced post the R G Kar incident. ""Through posters and paintings made by women, we have decided to draw the attention of people to what happened in the Kolkata hospital and how women in other workplaces are facing similar challenges. We have shown the many battles that a woman has to wage and how sticking together, as a community, is the only way to fight societal evils,"" said Sujata Pan, convenor of the cultural committee. ""Durga Puja is more than just a religious festival for us; it's about honouring the strength and wisdom of women,"" said Sanjay Bose from the association. He highlighted their âNari Shakti' team, which provides essential support to underprivileged families, reinforcing their commitment to women's empowerment. To continue fight for justice Since Aug, a large group of members from the Utsav Cultural Association in Gachibowli â many of them IT professionals â have led rallies demanding justice for the R G Kar victim and better security for women in workplaces. To keep their fight going, members of this group have decided to stick to low-key festivities this year so that those in places of authority do not think that the people's movement across India has died out. ""We will follow all traditions and rituals through the five-days of Durga Puja, but in the middle of it all, we cannot forget what happened to one of our sisters in Kolkata. We initiated the protest, and we cannot abandon it until justice is achieved. The Goddess herself symbolises feminine power, making this the perfect time to raise our voice for justice. We will not find peace until that is achieved,"" said Sayantani Chatterjee, a member of the association. ""We do not want to celebrate extravagantly while this injustice remains unaddressed,"" added Indranil Aditya, joint secretary of the association."
324,"'Fighter, advocate of the oppressed': Politicians, family mourn GN Saibaba","NEW DELHI: The family of  GN Saibaba  informed on Sunday that the body of the 54-year-old ex-Delhi University professor would be donated to government-run  Gandhi Medical College . ""That has always been his wish. We have already donated his eyes to  LV Prasad Eye Institute  (in Hyderabad), and his body will also be donated tomorrow,"" Saibaba's daughter Manjeera told news agency PTI. Roughly seven months after he was cleared of having links with  Maoists , the ex-DU passed away on Saturday night due to post-surgery complications at  Nizamâs Institute of Medical Sciences  hospital. Saibaba was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and underwent surgery two weeks ago, but later experienced complications.  Following his release from jail, he received medical care in Delhi for several health issues that arose due to his extended imprisonment. âWhen I went to prison, I had no ailment other than my disability. Now, my heart is 55% functional... liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected,â he had said at the time of his release from jail. His daughter recalled that the last time she spoke with her father was the day before evening and he told that it was going to be fine. ""None of us, not even he could have anticipated something like this would have happened."" 'We were hoping for another miracle to happen, it did not happen this time. His body had borne too much all these years,"" Manjeera told news agency PTI. Meanwhile, GN Saibaba's brother told news agency ANI: ""NIMS doctors declared his death at 8:36 pm today because of many ailments. He had his gallbladder surgery in NIMS. The surgery was successful and he was able to talk to us able to move freely in the wheelchair he was very good for the last five days after surgery. But all of a sudden we don't know what happened a pus formed inside and he started getting fever and severe abdominal pain for five days doctors did some medical medication but still either pain or temperature control. They found that a pus inside and then they did a procedure to remove the pus two days back...But later the next day they found that there was internal bleeding in the stomach and they made a procedure to stop it. But after stopping also he could not recover"". His friends and colleagues remembered Saibaba, whom they fondly reffered Sai, as a fighter.  âHe got polio when he was five years old. That is when his struggle began and never ended,â said Nandita Narain, former St Stephenâs College professor.  âI learnt about him when I was elected member of DUâs Executive Council from 1996 to 2000. He once came to my house with his wife when he didnât have a wheelchair. He was just dragging himself, but had a big smile on his face.â Narain added, âThose 10 years in jail left him completely broken. He was thrown around and dragged when he got arrested. He had 21 ailments when we last counted. They did this to him because he spoke up on issues that nobody spoke about. They wanted to crush his voice. He still had the determination. In the prison, he used to teach inmates.â She also remembered, âWhen he came out of prison, he made pickles with lemons from Medak himself and gave them to me. He said it would be good for my health.â  Saibaba had a strong presence and he drove things, recalled Karen Gabriel, vice principal of St Stephenâs. âWe had common issues that we were fighting like land grabbing, illegal mining, etc., and we became good friendsâ.  Gabriel said Saibaba hadnât ever been fragile. âThen we saw how fragile they made him in prison. He was barely able to lift his right arm when left jail. His organs were damaged,â she said. âI spoke to his family and they are in a shambles.â âSaibaba played a key role in several peopleâs movements like pro-reservation protests in 1989-90, democratic rights of prisoners in 1993, movement to support the rights of Adivasis, and several others. Though he hailed from Andhra Pradesh, he led a huge public meeting in support for the formation of separate Telangana in 1997,â said K Ravi Chander, convener for Forum Against Repression. Meanwhile, there were political reactions too, with Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin hailing the ex-DU professor as a ""tireless advocate of the oppressed"".  ""Prof. G.N. Saibabaâs passing away is a profound loss for the human rights community. A tireless advocate for the oppressed, he fearlessly fought against injustice, even when his own freedom and health were at risk. His courage in defending civil liberties, despite many challenges, will be remembered as an enduring example of integrity. My sincere condolences to his family and loved ones during this difficult time,"" Stalin wrote on X.  AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi blamed the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for the death of former Delhi University professor GN Saibaba. âProf Saibabaâs death is also deeply concerning,â Owaisi wrote on X. âHis death was also partly a result of the UAPA that allows cops to keep you in prison for lengthy periods without any evidence.â ""It is very disheartening to hear about the cowardly attack on Baba Siddique, in which he unfortunately lost his life. This shows the complete lack of will of political parties. This clearly shows that the current state government is not at all concerned about providing safety to the common people of Mumbai and Maharashtra in general... They are only concerned about saving their chair and their skin so that they can win the next election... What happened to Baba Siddique is a complete failure of law and order,"" he said news agency ANI.  TMC MP Saket Gokhale called his death a âmurderâ and added, âThis murder was perpetrated by the govt which framed him in a false case & then the judicial system which denied him personal liberty for over 10 years & âstayedâ his acquittal.â The CPM of Kerala, meanwhile, alleged that the Union government was responsible for his demise, while mourning his death.  âHe was denied bail for years. He was denied medical treatment urgently required for a person with such acute disabilities. His was a life dedicated to fighting for justice, facing torture with courage. The responsibility for his death lies with the govt. In sorrow and anger at the injustice he suffered we salute this brave fighter for justice. We express deep condolences to his wife, Vasantha, and daughter, Manjeera,â the party said in a post on X."
325,Calcutta HC refuses to prohibit protest march to CM Mamata Banerjee's office,"KOLKATA:  Calcutta high court  on Friday declined to impose any  prohibitory order  on the   called by the  Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj  on Aug 27. A division bench of Justice Harish Tandon and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya passed the order while taking note of the  apex court order  on  peaceful protests  from any quarter of the civil society. At the same time, the division bench took note of  public peace , safety, convenience of the public at large and directed the respondents (the organisers of the programme) to disclose their stand within three days from date.  The petitioner, a high court lawyer and resident of  Howrah , had moved the court praying for reasonable restrictions on the rally on the ground that the proposed rally route connected National Highway 117 and was dotted with a number schools, hospitals, colleges and public institutions. Counsel for the petitioner Jaydip Kar urged for reasonable restrictions, not prohibition, on the rally in view of the violence and bloodshed in the same area last year. Kar also pointed out that the UGC-NET examination was scheduled across the country on that date. ""The right to protest is subject to reasonable restrictions,"" Kar submitted. Kar pleaded for a balance between the right to protest and the right of others.  Justice Tandon said that maintaining  public order  was the state's prerogative. ""They have to take adequate measures. That is their duty,"" Justice Tandon said. Advocate general Kishore Datta in his virtual appearance submitted that the state can't exercise its regulatory powers because the organisers of the rally didn't make an application to the police enabling the law enforcing authority to use regulatory powers. Datta pointed out that the call was given through social media. ""The challenge today is that an unknown group of people has given a call for the Nabanna march when the place is under prohibitory orders,"" the advocate general said. He submitted that Nabanna is a ""public premise"" under the law and argued no one can claim to protest at a public premise as a matter of right. The advocate general also placed on record the UGC-NET examination scheduled on Aug 27. The division bench while taking note of the apex court order on peaceful protests from any quarter of civil society didn't prohibit the rally."
326,RG Kar case: Doctors take out protest march on Mahalaya in Kolkata,"NEW DELHI: A protest march was organised by the  Bengal Junior Doctors' Front  in Kolkata on Wednesday, demanding justice for a medic who was raped and murdered at the state-run  RG Kar Medical College and Hospital  in August. The march, which began at College Street and ended in Esplanade area, was joined by thousands of junior doctors and people from various walks of life. The protesters vowed to continue their agitation until the government takes decisive action. One of the protesters, identifying herself as a colleague of the deceased, said, ""We are not in a 'Puja' or 'Utsav' mood, and we will continue protesting on the streets till our sister gets justice. We have chosen this day of Mahalaya to send out this message."" The protesters carried placards and national flags, raising slogans and asserting their determination to fight for justice. The march coincided with the ongoing 'cease-work' stir by doctors in hospitals, protesting against the heinous crime. As the rally concluded at Esplanade, leaders of the Bengal Junior Doctors' Front pledged to continue their agitation until the government takes definitive action. An agitating junior doctor addressed the crowd, saying, ""We will not give up. This is about our safety, our dignity, and  justice for Abhaya . The government cannot expect us to remain silent while they do nothing."" The rally attracted a diverse mix of participants, including doctors, nurses, medical students, and concerned citizens. Later, the protesters gathered on the banks of Ganga, lighting 1,000 diyas as a symbolic act in their fight for justice. Despite the festive atmosphere in the city due to the upcoming Durga Puja, the protesters maintained that their movement for justice took precedence over celebrations. Aniket Mahato, one of the agitating junior doctors, addressed the crowd at Esplanade, saying, ""Today is the 52nd day of our protest, and we are still facing attacks. There is no positive response from the state government toward meeting our safety and security demands."" The junior doctors in West Bengal have resumed their 'cease work' protest, claiming that the state government has failed to fulfill the promises made in mid-September. The doctors had partially resumed services after a 42-day strike but went back to the protest on Tuesday, citing the lack of implementation of key demands such as enhanced safety measures for medical staff. The Bengal Junior Doctors' Front has raised several demands, including the installation of CCTV cameras on hospital premises, round-the-clock security for healthcare workers, and stricter protocols to prevent incidents of violence against medical professionals. The doctors have also highlighted the culture of fear and intimidation within state-run hospitals, alleging that the administration has not provided a safe working environment. ""We joined our profession to serve the people, but how can we do so when we constantly live in fear? We don't feel safe in the very places where we are supposed to save lives,"" said another junior doctor. Despite initial promises by the  West Bengal government  to address the doctors' concerns, the agitating doctors claim that there has been little follow-up action. The government's attempts to broker peace with the doctors have so far been unsuccessful, with state officials urging the medics to return to work and suggesting that police investigations into the alleged murder of the junior doctor are ongoing. The junior doctors' protest has received widespread support from Kolkata's general public, with many residents expressing solidarity with the movement. ""This is not just about doctors. This is about justice, about safety in our institutions, and about holding those in power accountable,"" said Swati Mukherjee, a homemaker who joined the rally along with her family. As tensions between the junior doctors and the state government intensify, the protest movement is expected to continue in the coming weeks, even as Kolkata prepares for its biggest festival of the year.  In a symbolic gesture, a statue named 'Abhaya' was unveiled on RG Kar Hospital premises, which the agitating doctors claim represents the horrific incident that occurred on August 9 and the ongoing protests demanding justice. ""This statue is not of the victim, but a symbol of pain, torture she went through and the ongoing protests,"" a junior doctor of the hospital told reporters."
327,Changes in institutions must happen incrementally: CJI Chandrachud,"Bengaluru: Emphasising the need for  good institutions  to evolve, Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud said Sunday that the changes, however, should take place incrementally, failing which there would be the risk of destabilising what has been achieved over the past 75 years. Speaking at the 32nd annual convocation of  National Law School of India University  (NLSIU), at which 1079 students graduated, the CJI urged young lawyers to approach life with patience.  He cited Walter McMillian's case in the US, where lawyer Stevenson spent years gathering evidence and, after six years, ensured McMillan's release from death row in 1993.  ""Judges sometimes ask peculiar questions. I asked one such peculiar question when I was dealing with a review petition against an order confirming a death penalty. As you know, review petitions and death penalty cases are now heard in open court in the Supreme Court. I was quite impertinent in asking a question to the lawyer â How long would you take? The lawyer responded, âif you have the patience, I will persuade you that not only is this a case for commutation of the sentence of death to life, but this is the case for a clean acquittal'."" ""We gave that little bit of patience that afternoon, but it resulted in the acquittal of the accused,"" he said, to thunderous applause from young lawyers. The university awarded 48 gold medals to graduates during the convocation. The CJI, who is also the chancellor of NLSIU, said, ""College life not only teaches you core subjects of law and social science, but it also teaches you how to navigate your life... There's one thing which is liberating, which a  law degree  does to you, which is that you leave that baggage at the threshold. And as you emerge, there is only one steady stream of values that must guide you from now, and those are the values of the Constitution."" He urged the graduates to build a strong support network â spend time with family and friends. ""There are times when I return home in the evening and I feel terribly alone and lonesome. But that sense of loneliness is balanced by the friendship of close friends, the love of family, of people who have mentored me, but most importantly, of people I am mentoring,"" he said, reminding them to render mentorship and guidance, just as they ask for help. He referred to a question asked a few days ago on how he takes decisions in this vortex of conflicts that comes to him in the Supreme Court. He recalled his reply: ""I said, once you've heard fairly, different viewpoints, then you retreat into yourself, and that's when you shut out the cacophony of voices, then you appeal to something within, which is guided by the eternal values which we are intended to espouse â liberty, dignity, and autonomy of the individual. The decisions you face, particularly the difficult ones, will require strength."" He urged students to remember to pause and listen to their inner voice in moments of uncertainty when facing tough choices and take pride in one's individuality. ""Your unique perspectives, shaped by your individual experiences, are invaluable. Don't be afraid to bring them to the table, even when - especially when - they differ from the mainstream view. As you move forward in your careers, strive to be not just great minds, but also compassionate human beings,"" he told young lawyers."
328,Jewish support for Democrats at historic low since Reagan era ahead of 2024 election: Poll,"A recent poll conducted by the  Manhattan Institute  has revealed that  Jewish support  for the Democratic Party is at its lowest since the Reagan era, as Vice President   struggles to rally voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The survey, carried out between October 5 and 9, included a representative sample of 658 Jewish registered voters across the United States and highlighted growing concerns within the Jewish community regarding  antisemitism , Israel, and other policy issues. While Jewish voters remain predominantly aligned with the Democratic Party, their support is weakening. According to the Manhattan Institute poll, Harris is poised to perform worse among Jewish voters than any Democratic candidate since the 1980s. If the election were held today, the poll indicates that Harris would secure 67% of the Jewish vote, while former President   would receive 31%. This shift in support marks a significant departure from past election cycles. Historically, Jewish voters have shown strong support for Democratic candidates. In 1992, Bill Clinton secured 80% of the Jewish vote over George Bush Sr. However, support has gradually declined; Joe Biden received 68% of the Jewish vote in 2020, while Hillary Clinton won 71% in 2016. The trend of declining Jewish support for  Democrats  has accelerated since the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas. The pollâs findings reveal that Jewish voters are increasingly uneasy about the Democratic Partyâs stance on antisemitism. A significant 62% of respondents expressed concern over growing antisemitism within the party. Jesse Arm, Chief of Staff at the Manhattan Institute, noted, âMany are likely uncomfortable with the Democratic Partyâs tolerance of voices that criticize Israel in extreme terms, such as labeling the country âgenocidal.â This is evidenced by the fact that Jews are almost universally supportive of Israelâa mere 5% of Jewish voters say they are not supporters of the Jewish state.â The survey also found that Jewish voters are largely united in their support for Israel, with 86% expressing strong support for the Jewish state. âSecurity, Israel, and antisemitismâ were identified as Harrisâs weakest issues relative to Trump among Jewish voters, indicating that these topics are pivotal in shaping Jewish voter preferences ahead of the election. Despite the overall decline in support for the Democratic Party, Jewish voters still align with Democrats on specific issues, such as abortion. A majority of Jewish Republicans also described themselves as pro-choice. In contrast, on immigration, crime, and fiscal matters, Jewish votersâ views diverge, showing a mix of moderate and conservative positions. For instance, Jewish voters want increased vetting in the immigration process but are generally supportive of expanding high-skilled immigration. On crime, Jewish voters are more in line with Republican views, feeling that the nationâs criminal justice system is not tough enough. They are also fiscally moderate, expressing concern over government spending while supporting higher taxes on middle- to upper-income brackets. The poll also shed light on Jewish voters' perspectives on free speech and university policies. Jewish respondents expressed support for laws banning people from covering their faces with the intent to conceal their identity in public places, a stance that gained traction following incidents of anti-Israel activists intimidating Jewish students on college campuses and targeting Jewish community members across the US. Additionally, Jewish voters expressed a desire for universities to be held accountable, supporting taxation on university endowments. They also showed a preference for a color-blind society over race-conscious policies, revealing divided opinions on affirmative action and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The poll highlighted denominational differences within the Jewish community regarding support for Harris and Trump. Harrisâs strongest backing came from Reform and unaffiliated or nondenominational Jews, who are traditionally more aligned with progressive causes. However, her support was notably weaker among Conservative Jewish voters, and Orthodox Jewish voters showed a preference for Trump, leading him by 18 points. Religious observance also played a role in voter preferences. Among Jewish voters who attend religious services weekly, Harris led Trump by a narrow margin of 51% to 46%. In contrast, those who never attend services overwhelmingly supported Harris, with a 75% to 24% lead over Trump."
329,"Gandhi Jayanti 2024: Remembering Mahatma Gandhi through the perspectives of international figures like Steve Jobs, Barack Obama and more","October 2nd holds immense significance for India as it commemorates the birth anniversary of  , the Father of the Nation. This day not only honours his contributions to India's independence but also serves as a reminder of his enduring message of peace,  non-violence , and  social justice . Gandhi's life and teachings have inspired countless individuals across the globe, transcending cultural and national boundaries. As the country celebrates Gandhi's 155th birthday, it's important to reflect on the profound impact he has had on various international figures. As India honours Gandhi on this significant day, the enduring legacy of his teachings continues to inspire individuals around the world. From technology leaders and musicians to political figures and actors, Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and justice resonates deeply, encouraging a collective commitment to peaceful change and social equity. His life serves as a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have in shaping the world, urging all of us to reflect on our own roles in fostering a more just and compassionate society. ' connection to Gandhi began during a pivotal moment in his life. At just 19, Jobs travelled to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. This journey deeply influenced his worldview and leadership style. Upon returning to the United States, he expressed a strong admiration for Gandhi, considering him a model for what he wanted to achieve. Jobs famously said, ""He changed the world,"" highlighting Gandhi's ability to inspire change through peaceful means. During a particularly challenging period at Apple, Jobs adopted the round wire-rimmed glasses famously worn by Gandhi, symbolising his reverence for the leader. In a 1999 interview, he named Gandhi as his Person of the Century, underscoring the significance of moral action in effecting social change. John Lennonâs relationship with Gandhi was both personal and philosophical. He often reflected on the paradox faced by nonviolent leaders like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., who were tragically assassinated despite their commitment to peace. In the early drafts of the iconic Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover, Lennon included Gandhi among a collage of influential figures but ultimately replaced him with a palm leaf due to concerns over potential backlash. Lennon's commitment to non-violence was evident in his activism against the Vietnam War, where he and Yoko Ono advocated for peace. His song ""Mind Games"" explicitly references Gandhi, illustrating the deep resonance of Gandhi's principles in Lennon's pursuit of social justice. The Dalai Lama has frequently spoken about Gandhi's profound impact on his life and philosophy. During his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 1989, he paid tribute to Gandhi as a pioneering figure of non-violent resistance. Reflecting on Gandhiâs legacy, the Dalai Lama has described him as the most influential person of the 20th century, particularly for his promotion of ahimsa (non-violence). The Dalai Lama believes that Gandhiâs approach to achieving social and political change through non-violent means remains relevant today, inspiring individuals and movements worldwide.  has openly acknowledged the influence Gandhi has had on his life and political philosophy. In his memoir, he writes about how Gandhiâs teachings shaped his understanding of leadership and justice, alongside figures like Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. During a visit to Gandhi's residence in Mumbai, Obama expressed a desire to engage with Gandhi's legacy, reflecting on the strength and creativity that Gandhi demonstrated in his struggles. Keeping a framed picture of Gandhi in his Senate office served as a constant reminder of the ideals of peace and perseverance that Gandhi stood for. Matt Damon attributes much of his commitment to humanitarian efforts to the inspiration he drew from Gandhiâs teachings. He recalls that as a child, his mother kept a magnet on their refrigerator featuring a quote from Gandhi: ""No matter how insignificant what you do may seem, it is important that you do it."" This early exposure to Gandhi's philosophy instilled in him the importance of contributing positively to society, shaping his values and actions as an adult. Damonâs dedication to social causes reflects the powerful influence that Gandhi's words can have across generations."
330,"G N Saibaba, DU professor cleared of Naxal links after 10-year ordeal, dies","HYDERABAD: Barely seven months after he was cleared of having links with  Maoists  by Bombay HC, which called the trial court proceedings a âfailure of justiceâ, former DU professor GN Saibaba died Saturday night at  Nizamâs Institute of Medical Sciences  hospital. Doctors said he was admitted for removal of gallstones and died of post-surgery complications. The 57-year-old wheelchair-bound teacher and activist spent over seven years in jail after he was first arrested in May 2014. He was acquitted in March by the HC. âWhen I went to prison, I had no ailm ent other than my disability. Now, my heart is 55% functional... liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected,â heâd said on his release. Acquitting him, the Nagpur bench of  Bombay High Court  had called the trial court proceedings a âfailure of justiceâ, and pointed out the lack of sanction under  UAPA  to prosecute him. It also said the prosecution had failed to establish the seizure of incriminating material from his house. âWhen I went to prison, I had no ailments other than my disability. Now, my heart i s only 55% functional, and I am facing muscular complications. My liver, gallbladder and pancreas have also been affected. My right hand is partially functional. My doctor says I need multiple surgeries,â he had told reporters after his release on March 6. âI couldnât go to the prison hospital. There was not a single access ramp for the disabled in the jail, no separate toilets. I was always physically lifted for my toilet and bath needs. How can one live like that?â he had said. Saibaba was kept in the âanda cellâ (solitary confinement) at  Nagpur central jail , which, he said, affected him mentally as well. Probe agencies came across Saibabaâs name allegedly after the arrest of a JNU student who claimed to have been acting as a courier between the professor and Maoists holed up in Abujhmarh forests in Chhattisgarh. Saibaba was arrested by Maharashtra police for allegedly conspiring to wage war against the nation besides violations under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). A Gadchiroli court convicted him of the charges and awarded him life imprisonment in 2017. After a prolonged legal battle, he was acquitted by the high court. âSaibaba played a key role in several peopleâs movements like pro-reservation protests in 1989-90, democratic rights of prisoners in 1993, movement to support the rights of Adivasis, and several others. Though he hailed from Andhra Pradesh, he led a huge public meeting in support for the formation of separate Telangana in 1997,â said K Ravi Chander, convener for Forum Against Repression, who knew Saibaba for 35 years. Saibaba was born in Anakapalli in AP. After graduating, he p ursued his postgraduation in University of Hyderabad. He was working as an English professor in Delhi University until he was arrested. After he was released from jail, he underwent medical treatment in Delhi for various health complications â a fallout of his prolonged stay in jail. He is survived by his wife and daughter. His friends and colleaguesremembered Saibaba, whom they fondly called Sai, as a fighter. âHe got polio when he was five years old. That is when his struggle began and never ended,â said Nandita Narain, former St Stephenâs College professor. âI learnt about him when I was elected member of DUâs Executive Council from 1996 to 2000. He once came to my house with his wife when he didnât have a wheelchair. He was just dragging himself, but had a big smile on his face.â Narain added, âThose 10 years in jail left him completely broken. He was thrown around and dragged when he got arrested. He had 21 ailments when we last counted. They did this to him because he spoke up on issues that nobody spoke about. They wanted to crush his voice. He still had the determination. In the prison, he used to teach inmates.â She also remembered, âWhen he came out of prison, he made pickles with lemons from Medak himself and gave them to me. He said it would be good for my health.â Saibaba had a strong presence and he drove things, recalled Karen Gabriel, viceprincipal of St Stephenâs. âWe had common issues that we were fighting like land grabbing, illegal mining, etc., and we became good friendsâ. Gabriel said Saibaba hadnât ever been fragile. âThen we saw how fragile they made him in prison. He was barely able to lift his right arm when left jail. His organs were damaged,â she said. âI spoke to his family and they are in a shambles.â (With inputs from Meghna Dhulia)"

332,"It's not humour, it's hate: Amputee Tinkesh Kaushik blasts comedian Samay Raina","Comedian  Samay Raina  who rose to fame after winning  Comicstaan 2  and is currently a judge on  India's Got Latent , a talent show for comedians on YouTube, has come under fire for making derogatory comments against people with  disabilities  on the show during a stand-up performance, by using offensive words like 'lang de', 'apahij', 'goonga', 'behra' and 'hakla' (terms for people with physical disabilities and speech disorders). Originally, this issue was pointed out by Dr Satyendra Singh on 'X', (formerly known as Twitter). Highlighting that the 5 jury members were laughing at the jokes being fired at the disabled people.  In his post, Dr Singh mentioned ""All 5 judges gave standing ovation to Santosh Patra for mocking people w/ disabilities on #IndiasGotLatent at @indiehabitat. I watched in disbelief as the judges laughed hysterically, clapping & finding this blatant #DisabilityAbuse entertaining."" Dr Satyendra also took the step to send legal notice for Defamation and Disability Discrimination to the jury members, which included Samay Raina, Nishant Tanwar, Vipul Goyal, Sonali Thakker and Santosh Patra of the show. Dr Satyendra Singh practices in Delhi at the Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital and the University College of Medical Sciences. Singh, a physiologist by profession, was diagnosed with poliomyelitis when he was nine months old. He is also the founder and Organizational Head of âDoctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change,â a national collective of health professionals with disabilities. After this, posting a clip from the show, triple amputee  Tinkesh Kaushik  in his LinkedIn post expressed disappointment over Raina's indiscriminate use of the terms that mocked disabled people. ""If you laughed along, think again. It's not humor. It's hate,"" a part of his post read. The clip shows Raina asking a participant things like - 'where did you learn to stammer, and 'how would you talk to a langde'. When the participant mocks a physically disabled person by imitating their walk, Raina responds with -   (sometimes, success is climbed on one leg). Flagging the incident, activist and triple amputee Tinkesh Kaushik, took to social media highlighting Raina's use of offensive language. ""Samay Raina by imitating stammering, throwing around words like langde, apahij, goonga, behra, hakla-without a shred of shame you think you are cool? And this dehumanising is laughed at by the audience? How empty your lives must be. Any one of you can become langde, apahij, goonga, behra, andha at any point in your lives. It takes one accident. Or you may have a child who is disabled later in life. Think about it. Will you laugh then?"" he wrote. Tagging Dr. Virendra Kumar, Minister for  Social Justice  & Empowerment, in his post, Kaushik, demanded   against Raina. ""How is this acceptable in 2024? The section 92(a) of the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities  Act 2016 states whoever intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a person with disability in any place within public view shall be punishable with imprisonment. If you laughed along, think again. It's not humor. It's hate,"" wrote Kaushik, questioning the audience present at the show, who laughed along when Raina made these comments during the performance of the participant. Tinkesh Kaushik became the world's first triple amputee to reach the Mount Everest Base Camp located 17,598 feet above sea level, according to a report. He achieved the feat on May 11 and said it was possible due to his mental strength. Kaushik had lost both his limbs below the knees and a hand following an electrocution accident in Haryana when he was 9 years old. He uses prosthetic limbs and works as a fitness coach. The post elicited a strong response from netizens who slammed the comedian's behavior and demanded a boycott of such shows. Having fun at other's expanse, specially when someone had no control over his condition, is not funny. And this is not the first time Samay Raina has been criticized for his insensitive jokes.

""Very indecent and insulting behaviour, shows their upbringing and culture. Boycott shows by these so called comedians,"" wrote a social media user. ""And then they try to defend their shameless acts with ""take  comedy  as comedy, it's just dark humour"". Ask them if they would feel the same when a foreigner makes racist jokes about indians' skin colour. Would they still ignore it in the name of comedy? Worst part is they might never apologize bcz majority 'non-disabled' people will continue to overlook it. I wish they get some education!"" wrote another one. ""This is disgraceful, disgusting.. I donât know howâs their conscience allow these acts,"" remarked a furious user.

""How is it that people with disabilities and non traditional sexual orientations are abused with full immunity, but say one thing about religion, and people will send threats to your family? This outrage clearly won't help since they've their heads inside their rear ends to take a gander around.

333,Arbitration no longer 'alternative' but preferred in dispute resolution: CJI Chandrachud,"NEW DELHI:  Chief Justice  DY Chandrachud on Thursday, said that simply establishing  arbitration institutions  is not enough, and measures must be taken to prevent these dispute resolution centers from being dominated by a ""self-perpetuating clique."" Speaking at the   of the United Kingdom, Chandrachud urged countries like India to rise to the challenge of fostering and promoting a culture of commercial arbitration. He believes that the strong institutionalization of arbitration will contribute to the development of an arbitration culture in the Global South. ""In recent years, institutions such as India International Arbitration Centre and Mumbai and Delhi International Arbitration Centers have been set up and are seeing a steady flow of arbitration matters. But the mere creation of institutions is not sufficient. We have to ensure that these new institutions are not controlled by a  self-perpetrating clique . These institutions must be based on the foundation of robust professionalism and the ability to generate consistent arbitral processes,"" the CJI said. The CJI also pointed out that arbitration is no longer just an ""alternative"" of dispute resolution but has become the preferred approach for seeking commercial justice.  The CJI stressed that transparency and accountability, which are used to assess and critique the work of traditional courts, should not be foreign to the world of arbitration.  Chandrachud also expressed his hope that Indian arbitral institutions will emulate the success of their global counterparts in the coming years. He said, ""Arbitral institutions are uniquely placed to cooperate with other arbitral institutions around the world to adopt best international practices and procedures. This will create a global convergence of arbitral procedures, creating more uniform institutional rules and structures. I hope the Indian arbitral institutions emulate the success of their global counterparts in the years to come."" Chandrachud reiterated that the substitution of courts should not lead to the creation of opaque structures. He argued that the call for greater diversity in the world of arbitration, whether in terms of gender or from the Global South, is based on the strong belief that bringing a diversity of viewpoints will result in a more broad-based process. He also emphasized the significant role of technology in the arbitration process, noting that it offers cost-effective and time-effective solutions, such as allowing parties and arbitrators from different locations to participate in arbitral proceedings virtually. The CJI highlighted that the adoption of technology at all levels of arbitration proceedings will enhance the efficiency and accessibility of the arbitration process. ""You have instances where one party is based in Delhi, another in Bengaluru, while the arbitrators are in London, Mumbai and Singapore. Technology provides the digital environment allowing them to participate in arbitral proceedings virtually,"" said Chandrachud. Chandrachud also noted that despite the high courts and district courts in India disposing of a significant number of cases in 2023, the courts remain overburdened. He emphasized that the judiciary in India operates on the principle that no case is too small or too big and that every aggrieved person who approaches the courts has the right to a just remedy.  However, he acknowledged that not every case needs to be resolved before a court, and emerging forms of dispute resolution such as arbitration and mediation are gaining acceptance.

Demanding the arrest of all culprits in the case, the mother of the post-graduate trainee whose body was found in  RG Kar Medical College and Hospital  on August 9 said she had one child and now all the protesting medics are her children.  In south Kolkata, around 4,000 former students of over 40 schools, a large number of them women, walked a distance of 2 km demanding justice for the victim.  The former students of various ages chanted 'We Want Justice' as they walked along Rash Behari Avenue to the crossing of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road from Gariahat.  Ex-students of institutes like Binodini Girls School, Mitra Institution, Garfa High School, Carmel High School and St John's Diocesan took part in the procession, singing the iconic composition of rebel poet Kaji Nazrul Islam: ""Karar oi louho kopat, bhenge phel korre lopat"" (Destroy the iron gates of prison).  A key organiser, Garima Ghosh said, ""Apart from the main demand - punishment for all those involved in the brutal attack-murder of Abhaya (the symbolic name of the victim), we seek safety of women in all workplaces,"" she said.  In another rally from the potters' hub of Kumartuli in north Kolkata, clay modellers took out a rally along Rabindra Sarani to Shyambazar five-point crossing, with a girl dressed as Goddess Durga leading the procession.  Singing Arijit Sing's song 'Aar kabe' (how long) in solidarity with sexually violated women, the protesters held aloft placards demanding speedy investigation and justice in the R G Kar murder-rape incident.  Sculptor Sanatan Dinda and singer Lagnajita were also part of the procession.  ""One month has passed, but the fire within us will rage on till the culprits are flushed,"" Dinda said.  Lagnajita, a known face of the movement, said, ""We will not rest till our sister gets justice. We will peacefully protest even if it lasts for months.""

""We demand justice for Abhaya - who is our daughter,"" said Rameshwa Shaw, a rickshaw puller who is originally from Darbhanga in Bihar.  Hundreds of junior doctors of state-run NRS Hospital took out a rally from Sealdah to Esplanade in the heart of the city.  The parents of the murdered doctor were present at the spot in Esplanade where the rally culminated.  The victim's mother said, ""Whenever I think about the torment, the pain experienced by my daughter on that night, I shudder. She had dreams to serve the society, Now, all these protesters are all my children.""  Hundreds of junior doctors of R G Kar hospital - the epicentre of the movement since August 10 - formed a human chain at 5 pm and sang the national anthem holding the tri-colour.  They were joined by other citizens near a stage of left organisations SFI and DYFI.  At Hazra crossing in south Kolkata, several members of the Bengali entertainment industry sat on a dharna demanding justice for the deceased medic. They came to the spot in a procession from Tollygunge to Hazra, a distance of over 2 km.  Protest rallies were also held in several other places in West Bengal.  A scuffle broke out in one such march at Naihati in North 24 Parganas district after a group of youths, allegedly associated with the ruling Trinamool Congress entered into the rally.  The group accused the protesters of blocking the arterial Ghospara Road.  ""The group of men snapped the wire of a loudspeaker fitted on the top of a vehicle which was part of the rally and beat up some of the participants,"" one of the protestors alleged.  The police brought the situation under control.  Meanwhile, thousands of people were expected to hit the streets in various parts of the state at midnight on Sunday in the third edition 'Reclaim the Night' campaign.  After the success of the first such gathering on August 14, the second edition was organised on September 4."
335,Howard University: 10 landmark firsts of the institution that shaped Kamala Harris,"Kamala Devi Harris, born on October 20, 1964 in Oakland California, is currently serving as the 49th vice president of the United States alongside President Joe Biden since 2021. She holds the distinction of being the first woman to serve as vice president, making her the highest-ranking female official in U.S. history, as well as the first African American and Asian American to hold the office. Harris is the Democratic Party's presidential nominee for the 2024 election. On Sunday, July 21, US President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, officially endorsing Vice President   as the partyâs new nominee. Harris's remarkable education journey started at a high school in Quebec when she moved to Canada with her mother and sister at 12 years of age. After successfully completing high school Harris advanced to earn a major in Political Science and Economics from  Howard University . Following her graduation, she took admission to the University of California, Hastings College of Law to attain a law degree in 1989.  Howard played an instrumental role in building the career trajectory of Harris. Take a look at the history of the esteemed university and its significant firsts. Founded in 1867 in Washington, D.C., Howard University was established to provide education to freed African-Americans after the Civil War. Named after General Oliver Otis Howard, a Civil War hero and commissioner of the Freedmenâs Bureau, the university emerged as a symbol for Black excellence and educational empowerment. Initially established as a seminary for Black ministers, Howard evolved into a full-fledged institution with diverse academic disciplines, including medicine, law, and the arts. The university has played a significant role in the fight for civil rights and the advancement of African-Americans. Its law school, established in 1869, played a crucial role in shaping legal minds including Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court Justice of the US.  Howard's legacy is rooted in its alumni, who have broken racial barriers across various fields. Apart from Harris, the other notable graduates include Toni Morrison, Nobel laureate in literature; Kamala Harris, and Ralph Bunche, the first African-American Nobel Peace Prize winner. The university's status as ""The Mecca"" reflects its role as a cultural and intellectual hub for Black students worldwide, symbolizing resilience, leadership, and progress in the face of historical challenges. Howard University has been the source of numerous historic firsts, from establishing the first Black law school to producing the first African-American Nobel laureate in literature. These milestones highlight the institution's pivotal role in shaping the career paths of its students. Howard University established the first law school at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU), becoming a hub for training African-American legal professionals. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are higher education institutions in the United States that were founded prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with a primary focus on serving African American students. Many of these institutions were established during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War and are predominantly located in the Southern United States. Howard University was the first Black university to have an Army Reserve Officersâ Training Corps (ROTC) program. Howard University initiated structured military training for Black officers in 1917 and established an official ROTC program in 1918. The objective was to provide Black military personnel with opportunities beyond infantry roles. Since its founding, the Howard Army ROTC has commissioned over 1,000 officers, many of whom have achieved the rank of general. Howard is a leading institution in producing Black candidates for both the Army and the Air Force. Ralph Bunche, a Howard alumnus, became the first African-American to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his mediation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Supported by a scholarship from Harvard University and a $1,000 fund raised by the Black community in Los Angeles, Bunche commenced his graduate studies in political science. He earned his master's degree in 1928 and spent the following six years splitting his time between teaching at Howard University and pursuing his doctoral studies at Harvard. Howard Law alumnus Thurgood Marshall became the first African-American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, making significant contributions to civil rights, including the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Marshall pursued his education at Lincoln University before attending the Howard University School of Law. There, he was guided by Charles Hamilton Houston, lawyer and the then dean of Howard University Law School, who encouraged his students to become ""social engineers"" dedicated to leveraging the law in the battle for civil rights. Robert C. Weaver, a Howard graduate, became the first African-American to serve as a U.S. Cabinet member when he was appointed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Weaver attended M Street High School, now known as Dunbar High School, which was renowned for its academic excellence during the era of racial segregation. He later pursued his education at Harvard University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Arts degree. Weaver also earned a Ph.D. in Economics, completing his doctorate in 1934. Howard University launched WHUR, the first commercial radio station owned and operated by an African-American university. WHUR, the first radio station in the Washington metropolitan area to adopt HD broadcasting, has been granted numerous accolades, including the esteemed NAB Marconi Award for Best Urban Station of the Year and the NAB Crystal Radio Award for Excellence in Community Service. On January 21, 2004, Howard Universityâs WHUR-FM Radio transitioned to digital broadcasting, making it the first commercial station in the region to implement HD RadioTM technology. Subsequently, on November 16, 2006, WHUR-WORLD, 96.3 HD-2, was introduced, featuring a diverse blend of music and information with the same superior audio quality as its parent station, WHUR. Ernest J. Wilson III, a Howard alumnus, became the first African-American to hold the position of Vice President at the World Bank. During his thirteen years with the Bank, Black guided the organization from its early, uncertain stages to becoming a prominent, efficient, and profitable development institution. He secured the Bank's reputation in U.S. capital markets, ensured its bonds were acceptable to major institutional investors, and achieved the highest commercial rating for its securities. Carol Moseley Braun, a Howard law graduate, became the first African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Before serving in the U.S. Senate, Moseley Braun was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1979 to 1988 and held the position of Cook County Recorder of Deeds from 1988 to 1992. Toni Morrison, a Howard graduate, became the first African-American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Toni Morrison, renowned for her lyrical novels such as ""Song of Solomon,"" ""Beloved,"" and ""Jazz,"" received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. The Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee announced the award in Stockholm, highlighting that Morrison ""brings to life a crucial aspect of American reality"" through novels marked by ""visionary power and poetic significance."" Howard alumna Kamala Harris made history as the first Black woman to become Vice President of the United States. Harris, originally from Oakland, California, completed her education at Howard University and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She started her legal career with the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, then moved to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and later worked with the City Attorney of San Francisco. In 2003, she was elected District Attorney of San Francisco. She served as California's Attorney General from 2010 to 2014, becoming the first woman, as well as the first African American and Asian American, to hold these positions in the state's history."

3,250 million people escaped multi-dimensional poverty between 2013-14 and 2022-23: NITI Aayog,"Nearly 250 million people escaped multidimensional  in nine years of the BJP-led  government between 2013-14 and 2022-23 with , Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan registering the highest decline in poverty, shows a discussion paper, jointly done by  and UNDP.The 248.2 million people who escaped multidimensional poverty in nine years l translates into 27.5 million people escaping multidimensional poverty every year, NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand said.According to the paper, multidimensional poverty in  has come down from 29.17% in 2013-14 to 11.28% in 2022-23, helping India achieve the sustainable development goal 1.2, which mandates countries to reduce poverty by half by 2030, much before the target.  The paper clarifies that due to lack of data for years between 2005-06 and 2015-16 and after 2019-21 concerning the incidence of poverty levels, headcount poverty ratios for 2013-14 and 2022-23 have been estimated on compound growth rate of the reduction in the incidence of poverty levels between 2005-06 and 2015-16 and 2015-16 and 2019-20.""Government has a goal to bring down multidimensional poverty to below 1% and all efforts are being made in that direction,"" NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam said.According to the paper, the rate of decline in  has accelerated during the period 2013-14 to 2002-23 on the back of a large number of initiatives and schemes of the government targeted at improving specific deprivation aspects. The paper said Uttar Pradesh saw the highest reduction with 59.4 million escaping poverty in this period followed Bihar (37.7 million), Madhya Pradesh (23 million) and Rajasthan (18.7 million).The UNDP had in its global MPI report released last year said 415 million people exited multidimensional poverty in India in 15 years, from 2005-06 to 2019-21 with the incidence of poverty falling from 55.1% in 2005-06 to 16.4% in 2019-21.Following this, NITI Aayog NITI Aayog said 135 million Indians moved out of multidimensional poverty in five years between 2015-16 and 2019-21 with the proportion of poor in the country down from 24.8% to 14.9% between 2015-16 and 2019-21, on the back of improvements in nutrition, years of schooling, sanitation and subsidized cooking fuel.The National Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, developed in 2021, measures simultaneous deprivations across the three equally weighted dimensions of health, education, and standard of living that are represented by 12 Sustainable Development Goals-aligned indicators.

4,From classroom to nationwide call: Rethinking 'boys will be boys' after Kolkata incident,"The recent case of  in Kolkata has sparked a nationwide debate about raising boys with a healthy respect for women to prevent future crimes. Experts emphasised the need for societal change, starting with education and parenting. The commonly heard phrase “boys will be boys” is criticised for perpetuating gender inequality and excusing inappropriate behavior.Reflecting this ingrained mindset, an incident from a Class 7 classroom was mentioned in The Times of India report by Neha Bhayana. During a 15-items activity, a boy expressed disgust upon the mention of “bra” as a clothing item. Srividya Sivakumar, the English teacher, used this moment to highlight that a bra is just a garment and should not be associated with secrecy or shame. Later conversations revealed the students were aware of the Kolkata rape-murder incident involving a young trainee doctor.Given the recent wave of sexual violence, there is growing support for the slogan “sirf beti mat bachao, bete ko sikhao” (don’t just save your daughters, teach your sons). This motto underlines the importance of raising boys correctly to prevent future crimes.Rape prevention and rehabilitation specialist Vasu Primlani told ToI the need to address the root causes of such crimes. In her 2018 YouTube video on “Solutions to India’s Rape Crisis,” she noted that laws alone do not deter crime; rather, they punish criminals after the fact. Primlani asserts, “To cure anything, you need to first address the cause. So, we need to talk to our boys if we want to prevent the crimes in the first place.”Parenting coach Pallavi Rao Chaturvedi stressed the necessity of starting education early and told ToI, “It is not a button you switch on when your son is a six-foot-tall teenager. If you want your son to treat girls well, protect them and not be a perpetrator of crime, start teaching them when they are five years old,” she says.One of the primary changes suggested by experts is treating sons and daughters equally at home. During a hearing on a suo motu case of the sexual abuse of two four-year-old girls, the Bombay High Court suggested focusing on educating boys about right and wrong instead of always instructing girls on how to behave. The court observed that male chauvinism persists and will continue until children are taught about equality.Long-standing research links India's deep-rooted  and notions of masculinity to the high rates of crimes against women, added the report.Early exposure to  is another major concern. Studies indicate that over 75% of child abusers and rapists were exposed to porn or violent media early, often before age 10. Sivakumar mentioned instances where young students have already seen or discussed pornography. She noted that parents need to monitor what content their children access.Sexuality educator Anju Kish told ToI the importance of consent education. She noted that Indian parents often hesitate to even mention the word “sex,” making discussions about consent even more difficult. Kish has held workshops in schools for 10 years and emphasised, “Consent is the foundation of all healthy relationships. Teaching this simple concept could possibly prevent countless sexual assaults and empower an entire generation.”In her workshops, Kish reminded students that consent is necessary for various daily interactions, not just sexual situations. She recounts an interaction with a father who realized he had taught his daughter to be cautious but never considered teaching his son about respecting boundaries.Despite efforts by NGOs and individuals, the reach of sexuality and consent education remains limited. Experts argue that this education should become part of the school curriculum and be prioritised at home. Harish Sadani, founder of Men Against Violence and Abuse (MAVA), highlighted that many instances of violence occur when men cannot handle rejection. These individuals, often raised without hearing “no,” find their egos hurt when they face rejection, sometimes leading to violent behavior.Parenting experts also advise fathers to be mindful of the examples they set for their sons. In efforts to bond with their sons, some fathers inadvertently set wrong goals by bragging about past relationships or encouraging explorative behavior, which can lead to misconstrued perceptions about women.  Experts collectively insist on the importance of early intervention, equal treatment at home, monitoring media consumption, consent education, and setting positive role models to foster a healthier and more respectful attitude towards women in future generations."

14,How rooftop solar is reshaping energy consumption,", a country full of vitality and aspirations, is experiencing a quiet but potent revolution on its rooftops. The development of solar technology is not merely changing the country’s skyline, but also reshaping its  patterns fundamentally.  is starting to emerge as a sign of  and energy independence, even in the most isolated villages and busy metropolises. A quiet transformation is taking place on the rooftops of India's vast urban areas. An increasing number of individuals, businesses, and industries are opting for  to meet their energy requirements in an eco-friendly manner.  systems decrease the dependency on fossil fuels by managing energy production with sunlight resulting in reduced carbon emissions. Rooftop solar has gained immense popularity among residential and commercial users. As per the , India has achieved 5th rank globally in solar power deployment. As of 30-06-2023, solar projects of a capacity of 70.10 GW have been commissioned in the country. This capacity of 70.10 GW includes 57.22 GW from ground-mounted solar projects, 10.37 GW from rooftop solar projects, and 2.51 GW from off-grid solar projects. Government incentives like the Solar Rooftop Subsidy Scheme, laws on net energy metering*, and endless endeavours to lower the cost of solar panels with continuous technological advancements made rooftop solar more cost-effective than in the past. (*According to the MoP Electricity (Rights of the Consumer) Rules 2020 amendment, the net metering will be allowed for the prosumers for loads up to 500 kW or up to the sanctioned load whichever is lower, and gross metering for loads above 500 kW. The consumer’s meter keeps track of the energy consumed and the energy generated by the system and is sent back to the utility grid. Net energy metering enables the consumer to pay for the net amount of the energy consumed over and above the energy generated.) India is moving towards its ambitious renewable energy goals, with the important connection between solar power and  guiding the . Thanks to continuous innovation and cost efficiency with increased production, solar power now competes with and is a practical replacement for traditional electricity sources in many areas. The smooth incorporation of solar energy into the grid system is transforming the energyscenario. Advanced smart grids and monitoring systems make sure that solar energy is distributed and used efficiently, ensuring stability and reliability in the power supply.The core of India's solar revolution exists in the most remote corners where access to electricity is still a far-off hope. Solar energy offers hope for  and socio-economic development as over 300 million people still lack access to electricity. Government efforts such as DDUGJY and the Saubhagya scheme have the goal of providing electricity to every home in rural regions, with solar power being the central aspect of decentralised energy solutions. Off-grid solar solutions, ranging from solar microgrids to portable lanterns, are closing the energy gap and giving rural communities access to clean, dependable electricity. The profound effect of solar electrification goes beyond just providing light; it triggers advancements in education, healthcare, and economic prospects, setting the foundation for inclusive development and poverty reduction in rural India.Although the future looks bright for solar power in India, there are still obstacles to overcome. The sporadic quality of solar power, along with storage constraints, creates operational challenges for grid stability and dependability. Addressing these obstacles requires funding for energy storage systems, grid infrastructure, and policy structures that encourage the incorporation of renewable energy. Additionally, the pressing issue of ensuring fair access to solar energy continues to be important. Even though cities are adopting solar technology, rural areas face obstacles like cost, knowledge, and awareness. Closing the gap between urban and rural areas requires a joint effort from policymakers, industry players, and civil society to ensure equitable and long-lasting energy for everyone. In conclusion, achieving India's renewable energy goals involves working together, being innovative, and implementing policies that benefit communities and protect the environment for future generations while maximising the potential of solar power. By making solar energy a key part of its energy transition, India is ready to take the lead in moving towards a more sustainable and brighter future.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

15,The original green drivers: The early adopters of electric cars in India are still passionate about EVs and sustainability,"Saumya Prasad, an ecologist, had been happily driving around Dehradun in an , ’s first electric car that was launched in 2013, for years. Then one day, in late 2022, three of the cells in its battery pack gave away. The company no longer supported the spares Prasad needed to fix the vehicle. The 46-year-old made a decision few would. She hired a truck to move the vehicle all the way to Bengaluru where , an e-car aficionado, had what she needed. The old-generation  can be repaired by replacing individual cells that have degraded within the pack, unlike the new  whose battery packs are completely sealed.“From Lobo, I got the cells that matched my car,” says Prasad. The entire process, including hauling the car to Bengaluru and back, cost her more than Rs 1 lakh. But she was soon back to driving in the hills and has clocked more than 14,000 km in her done-up vehicle. Prasad has taken a precaution as well. She has installed an active cell balancer, which reduces the chance of an individual cell degrading. With this, Prasad believes she can drive her e2o for another 10-15 years. Cars, she says, should be driven for as long as they are drivable. It is a belief many  of e-mobility share.In Bengaluru, Anand Vedula, a 38-year-old engineer, has been an e-driver all along—he started with an e-bike and followed it up with an e2o in 2016. He did not give up on his electric car even when his residential society did not allow it to be charged on the premises. He charged the car at a relative’s place a few blocks away. Not only is an electric car low on maintenance, Vedula says his small car is best for slow-speed driving in Bengaluru traffic. “The running cost works out to be less than a rupee for a kilometre,” he says. However, the battery needs replacement and he is hopeful that Lobo, again, will help.Lobo is one of the few people who collect parts from scrapped electric cars and refurbish them. His Xtra Reinforced Plastics is the destination for many early e-drivers when their old vehicles run into trouble. Lobo started servicing Reva cars in 2016, and e2o in 2018. He has serviced close to 300 cars.Prasad and Vedula belong to a close-knit  of early electric car owners who aren’t willing to trade their old vehicles or beliefs for a fancy, new four-wheeler.Some stick to their old electric cars even when they buy new ones. Gurgaon-based Sanjay Gupta, 60, is a pilot who has a small fleet of EVs. He bought his first electric car, Reva, way back in 2002. In 2005, he upgraded to Reva i. In 2013, he bought the e2o, powered by lithium-ion battery. Last year, he bought the BYD Atto 3 and this year a Tata Punch.The early EV owners are deeply interested in . It was their growing concern about climate change and the ecological impact of conventional vehicles that pushed them to be among the early adopters of electric mobility. “Electric vehicle is the future. It will drastically bring down our dependence on crude oil,” says Gupta.Ranjan Ray—an architect who relocated from Delhi to Bhubaneswar a couple of years ago as his kid suffered from breathing issues due to the air pollution in the capital city— knows the importance of a clean environment. He is an early adopter of the e2o. About a decade ago, he wanted to buy a small environment-friendly car. Then the only option was the two-door e2o, which cost upwards of Rs 8 lakh. Luckily, Mahindra came out with a scheme where one paid for the car upfront, with a monthly rental for the battery over the next five years. “So, I paid Rs 5.5 lakh for my first e2o and Rs 1.8 lakh over five years to Mahindra that took the entire responsibility of the battery,” he recalls. Later Ray would team up with PluginIndia, a community of EV users, to design RE:CHARGE, India’s first app to locate charging stations. Ray says health and well-being of the people around him are paramount and EVs make it possible.The early adopters took the plunge, trusting the technology, and formed communities to serve as brand ambassadors. They have provided valuable feedback on how to make products better for real-world use, paving the way for the mainstreaming of EVs, says Vivek Srivatsa, chief commercial officer, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, the largest player in the electric PV space.If the early adopters fuelled the initial spike in EV sales, many price-sensitive consumers have been generally slow to make the transition and pay a premium over ICE vehicles. Atul Gopal, a Pune-based teacher, says some early adopters of EVs are often not worried about price and are willing to compromise on features for the sake of sustainability. Gopal bought a second-hand e2o for Rs 7 lakh when a new car was priced at Rs 8 lakh.KV Suresh, a 70-year-old consultant engineer from Noida, bought his e2o in December 2013. It was billed from Bengaluru for Rs 8.7 lakh. At that point, he could have got a Suzuki Dzire petrol for Rs 5.5 lakh. Since then, he has clocked close to 1.6 lakh km, with the original battery pack. “I have had no major issue with the car. Regular service and a suspension overhaul have kept it going. My last visit to the service station was in late 2021,” says Suresh. Gopal, who is part of Plugin, says parts of scrapped cars are sold at cheap rates. This helps EV owners as many of their cars develop issues with battery and onboard chargers over the years. However, many of them know their way around their vehicles and can take care of minor issues. When the onboard charger of Prasad’s car developed a snag, she fixed it herself.Industry watchers say electric vehicles are beginning to make economic sense. Now there is price parity between electric and ICE vehicles which will fuel the purchase of electric PVs and increase their penetration, which is now a mere 2%.The Indian market is shifting from early adopters. People are choosing EVs as their primary vehicle, marking the maturity of the ecosystem, says Srivatsa.Now it is not just the eco-conscious who are going for EVs. The vehicles are technologically superior than many conventional cars and provide better comfort and acceleration. It won’t be difficult to achieve a penetration of 5%, says Chetan Maini, the man behind India’s first electric car, Reva. “We are seeing a shift from early adopters. Even smaller cities are throwing up the numbers,” he says.A recent McKinsey report sheds light on the factors propelling the growing interest in EVs among consumers. Environmental impact takes centre stage, followed by lower cost of total ownership and reduced engine noise, as key benefits of an EV. This attests to a shifting consumer landscape in the ownership of automobiles where sustainability ranks among the top criteria in purchase decisions.Despite the increasing consumer demand for sustainable options, challenges such as range anxiety, limited charging infrastructure and high initial costs persist. The difficulties were greater when the original  began their journey and yet nothing could faze them."
16,Shift of labour to non-farm jobs: Why it's high time to reform India's job-creation laws,"In 1918, B R Ambedkar wrote, 'If we succeed in sponging off our  in non- agricultural channels of production... they will cease to live by predation, and will not only earn their keep but give us a surplus.' More than a century later, the timing couldn't be better to realise Ambedkar's dream of  reducing 's 'self-exploitation' through the virtuous cycle of .Non-farm jobs fuel consumption and more jobs. However, accelerating farm-to-non-farm transition requires fixing the injustice, inefficiency and incoherence of laws that govern jobs.Mass  doesn't arise from government spending. No country would be poor, monetary policy made countries rich - they are, at best, a painkiller or steroid. India's goal is shifting from  to prosperity because of the direct benefit transfer revolution of the last decade. This has improved  efficiency and put a floor under extreme poverty.Our improved infrastructure - road- building has almost doubled to 30 km a day in the last decade - and human capital (the latest ASER report suggests we have more kids with more years of schooling than ever) provide fertile soil for productivity. The unfinished agenda of transforming our enterprise stack - 6.3 crore enterprises only translate to 25,000 companies with a paid-up capital of more than ₹10 crore - needs three reforms:  The most poisonous manifestation of our excessive regulatory cholesterol is the 26,134 jail provisions embedded in employer compliance. These rarely-used provisions have very few CEOs in jail. But they breed corruption, informality and low wages. About 17,819 of these jail provisions arise from job-creation legislation.Outcomes need teamwork. About 80% of all employer jail provisions arise from state legislation. Unreasonable jail provisions encourage transmission losses between what is written, interpreted, practised and enforced. The recent Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill 2023 is excellent. But Version 2.0 must raise ambitions (Version 1.0 only discards 2% laws), change philosophy (eliminate every jail provision that does not meet agreed criteria), and incentivise replication by states.Employers are asphyxiated by 6,000-plus filings (19% arise from job laws) and 69,000-plus compliances (26% derive from job laws). These laws are a thorn in the flesh for big employers who can afford large teams for compliance. But they are a dagger in the heart for small employers, who often surrender to the reality that you can't comply with 100% of job laws without violating 10% of them.Speed matters more than perfection. So, consolidating 42 central labour laws into four labour codes - mostly an aggregation exercise - was sound. But that new regime has not gone live.The world has changed since the labour code legislation. China factory refugees are looking at India with ambition, even though only 11% Indians work in manufacturing. We should use the delay in notifying the four labour codes to consolidate them into one code that is more straightforward and shorter (shared definitions, etc).India's self- interested trade union movement - which believes job preservation is a form of job creation, and chooses the old over the young - has infected work-linked social security programmes with high costs, low competition and excessive deductions. Consequently, only 0.1 crore of our 6.3 crore enterprises and 7.5 crore of our 55 crore workers make monthly social security contributions. Five design reforms by  are overdue: Benchmarking costs to gilt mutual funds.  Making employee contribution voluntary. Giving employees the option to pay their contribution to NPS. Paying into Aadhaar number for portability. Transfer pension scheme to public programmes and maintain employer-deducted programmes as defined contribution.Reforming  is challenging worldwide as some employers exploit employees. But without employers, there are no employees. And, most employers, especially successful ones, don't view employees as an expense to be minimised, but as human capital to be nurtured.Creating mass prosperity needs changing some of the laws that blunt non-farm employment, encourage machines over people and torture job-creators. The farmers' agitation deserves listening. But if we want to be good ancestors, we can't meet their demands. Helping them requires the higher financial viability of agriculture, which can only come through modernisation and a massive shift of labour to non-farm jobs.The labour code delay demonstrates that change is a difficult and controversial job. But as James Baldwin suggested, not everything we face can be changed. But nothing can be changed unless it is faced.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

17,Housing prices in this Delhi-NCR area jump by 69% in Q2 2024; know how much property price has risen in your city,"The average housing prices across the top eight cities increased by 12% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024 backed by robust demand momentum, according to a report released by CREDAI, Colliers and Liases Foras. Seven out of eight cities saw an increase in housing prices (annually) with Delhi NCR witnessing the highest rise, followed by Bengaluru. Residential housing prices in the Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) jumped by 30% year-on-year during the April-June quarter of 2024, the highest among the top eight cities in India, according to the report. In the Delhi-NCR region, the average housing prices jumped 69% in Dwarka Expressway during the quarter under review. Meanwhile, the average housing prices soared 45% year-on-year in Greater Noida during Q2 2024, according to the report. ""Both these markets saw select marquee projects by leading developers during the quarter within luxury and ultra-luxury segments,"" the report said. Bengaluru came second in the list as the housing prices jumped by 28% year-on-year in the southern city, as per the report. In Bengaluru, ""the Periphery & Outer East micro markets witnessed the highest price rise at 42% year-on-year. Ongoing Metro extensions and upcoming suburban rail projects are likely to further boost residential activity, especially in Inner East and Periphery and Outer North micro-markets,"" the report added. ""1BHK apartments continued to see healthy demand, with their prices rising at 44% year-on-year followed by 4BHK configuration at 29% year-on-year rise,"" the report said. ""Housing prices rose 13% YoY amid significant traction in mid-segment. With upcoming infrastructure developments such as Ahmedabad Metro Phase 2, City Square at Sindhu Bhavan Road, and the recent collaboration with ADB to develop the city’s peri-urban areas, Ahmedabad is likely to witness heightened residential activity in the next few years. City Central West and Eastern Suburb micro markets saw the highest annual price rise at 16% and 14%, respectively,"" the report mentioned. Boman Irani, President of CREDAI National stated, “Indian Real Estate has been somewhat experiencing a bull run in the past few quarters, substantiated by the volume of transactions across top eight cities as well as the prevalent positive sentiments towards housing. There has been a direct impact on housing prices — signifying not just the underlying demand but the definitive shift towards real estate as a preferred asset class. With the upcoming festive season — coupled with the Government’s focus on infrastructure and a relatively stable lending eco-system — we project this momentum to further have an impact on both prices and unsold inventory levels, as the industry's demand-supply dynamics change."" Badal Yagnik, Chief Executive Officer, Colliers, India says, ""Notably, average housing prices have witnessed a consistent double-digit annual growth rate (12% in Q2 2024,) adding buoyancy to the sustained growth story in residential real estate. Additionally, the upcoming festive season will further invigorate the housing market with heightened sales and new launches. We thus envisage a strong finish for the housing market in 2024.""Apart from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), unsold inventory levels declined by up to 5% on a quarterly basis across all cities under review. At 5%, Kolkata saw the highest sequential decline in unsold inventory levels followed by Pune with a 3% dip. As of Q2 2024, there was an availability of over 10 lakh housing units across the primary market of eight major cities, with MMR alone having about 40% share in unsold inventory levels, as per the report.""While MMR witnessed healthy sales in residential units during Q2 2024, a significant surge in new launches led to a marginal rise in unsold units. On an annual basis with a 13% YoY drop, Pune particularly witnessed the highest annual decline in unsold units. Annual decline in unsold inventory levels have been significant in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Kolkata too with 6-8% drop,"" the report added. Vimal Nadar, Senior Director and Head of Research, at Colliers India says, ""Within the residential market, demand growth has been the strongest in luxury and ultra-luxury segments including second and vacation homes which is evident with price growth in select micro-markets of Delhi NCR and Bengaluru. Average housing prices for spacious dwelling units, particularly 3-4BHK configurations in these cities have increased up to 30% on an annual basis. Additionally, the government’s recent partial rollback pertaining to long term capital gains arising out of the sale of land and buildings retrospectively is expected to boost investors and homeowners’ sentiment and thus, the real estate sector at large."""

19,"India's factory growth cooled to eight-month low in September, PMI shows","Growth in India's manufacturing industry cooled to an eight-month low in September as solid demand and output eased slightly, according to a business survey that also showed weaker price increases despite rising . Factory production growth has been weakening since June and is likely to have further affected the expansion rate in Asia's third-largest economy last quarter, after the rise in gross domestic product (GDP) softened to 6.7% in April-June. The HSBC final India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 56.5 last month from 57.5 in August - the weakest since January - and slightly below a preliminary estimate of 56.7. However, the reading has been above the 50-mark, which separates growth from contraction, since July 2021. ""Momentum in India's manufacturing sector softened in September from the very strong growth in the summer months,"" noted Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. New orders - a key gauge of demand - grew at the weakest pace since December, though were still robust, while output was at an eight-month low. International demand took a bigger hit and export growth eased to a level not seen in a year-and-a-half. Only 6% of firms surveyed reported an increase in overseas orders. That meant business sentiment soured slightly and the future output sub-index, indicating optimism among firms about the coming year, fell to its lowest since April 2023 and employment generation eased to a six-month low. Although input cost inflation increased from August, inflation in prices charged was at a five-month low, suggesting not all price rises were being passed on to customers amid weaker demand. ""Input prices rose at a faster rate in September while factory gate price inflation eased, intensifying the compression on manufacturers' margins,"" added Bhandari. However, a Reuters poll last month showed price pressures would increase in coming months despite inflation recently falling below the Reserve Bank of India's medium term target of 4%. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates on hold in October and only start cutting from December."

21,5 essential points to double-check before signing your rent agreement,"When considering renting a house, it's crucial not to sign the agreement hastily. Although a rental agreement includes various details, both parties must be vigilant about specific points. Before finalizing the deal, be sure to double-check the following points.All discussions about renting a property begin with determining the amount to be paid, and all rental contracts outline the specific amount, the due date, and the consequences of late payment. Ensuring that the amount stated in the contract matches what was verbally agreed upon is essential. Along with specifying the rent amount, contracts should clearly outline what is included or excluded. For instance, it's necessary to discuss and agree on who will cover expenses such as society maintenance fees and parking charges.This section addresses the amount tofrent that can be increased and the timeframe for this adjustment. Typically, this adjustment occurs annually for long-term agreements lasting three to four years and at the end of the term for short-term contracts, such as renewable 11-month lease and license agreements. Many first-time renters may not be informed about this section, and its presence in the agreement can be an unpleasant surprise. Discussing this matter with the broker or landlord when searching for rental properties is advisable.Even though rental agreements have fixed terms, such as 11 months or three years, there might be situations in which either the landlord or tenant needs to end the agreement early. The agreement should clearly outline the circumstances under which either party can terminate the contract prematurely and the penalties for violating these conditions. Two important terms to pay attention to are the  and . The notice period, similar to job contracts, allows the tenant or landlord to request the other party to vacate the property after giving a reasonable amount of time. Typically, the notice period is around a month and applies to both parties.The lock-in period is when the tenant is not allowed to vacate the premises, and the landlord cannot ask the tenant to leave. Typically, lock-in periods last around three months for 11-month agreements and 6-9 months for three-year contracts. Failure to comply with this provision can result in harsh penalties, such as forfeiture of the deposit by the tenant or the landlord being required to return double the deposit. It is essential to carefully review the agreement and ensure you agree to the specified terms.Be mindful that subletting  is limited by law. However, tenants should exercise caution as landlords may impose other limitations such as prohibiting pets or parking in society parking lots. It is important to thoroughly discuss all restrictions beforehand and ensure that only the agreed-upon limits are included in the final agreement. Tenants also have the right to object to unreasonable restrictions imposed by landlords, such as not allowing tenants to apply for passports while renting.Given that most rental agreements are for fully furnished or semi-furnished properties, it is crucial to document the furniture and fittings. A comprehensive inventory of furniture, fixtures, and fittings, along with repair costs in the event of damage, is typically provided as an annexure. It is important to thoroughly read and verify these details to prevent any potential issues in the future."

The June-September monsoon season ended with the country getting 7.6% more rainfall than normal, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Tuesday. Heavier-than-usual rain may have also dented economic activity. ""Lower growth in  in September could reflect the impact of heavy rainfall on activity in various sectors, similar to the impact seen on the core sectors,"" said Icra chief economist Aditi Nayar. ""We need to watch the trend in revenue collections in the festive season, when volumes are expected to rise.""Economic performance in FY25 has been robust thus far, with demand drivers getting broad-based as reflected in the strong growth of consumption and investment, said Paras Jasrai, senior economic analyst at India Ratings and Research.""Although PV (passenger vehicle) sales are down, two-wheeler sales have been good, so has been the trading activity with e-way bills touching record highs,"" Jasrai said. ""States are also expected to step up with their capex spend.""Announcements of fresh investment have risen from the first quarter, during which India's general elections were being conducted, based on Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data, Sabnavis said. After the elections got over, private sector investment intentions have turned positive, he said. A pickup in the Centre's spending after the general elections is also expected to provide support. While the expansion in factory activity is above the long-run average, September PMI at 56.5 was lower than 58.2 recorded in the first quarter of the current financial year. The average reading for the second quarter was 57.4. Numbers above 50 indicate expansion while those below signify contraction.Employment generation declined in September, ""reflecting a reduction in the number of part-time and temporary workers at some firms"", the PMI report noted. ""Output and new orders grew at a slower pace, and the deceleration in export demand growth was especially evident as the new export orders PMI was the lowest since March 2023."" Of the total collection, central GST stood at ₹28,775 crore, state GST at ₹36,037 crore, integrated GST at ₹76,461 crore and cess at ₹11,509 crore.

This focus on female agency - or the prevailing lack of it - offers a poignant lens to examine the reality of many sectors that lack  today.Take the PE-VC landscape.  is still a man's game, and underrepresentation of women at the helm translates into a missed opportunity for the entire sector. Several groundbreaking ventures go untapped because the room lacks the perspective that resonates with a significant portion of the market. There is gross underrepresentation of women, both as entrepreneurs and investors. Private market financial platform PitchBook's data updated to June 4 highlights that US companies founded solely by women received 2.1% of all VC investments. According to a 2020 study by business information firm Crunchbase, women accounted for less than 15% of cheque-writers.Similarity, affinity bias, or a tendency to depend upon someone who looks the same, talks the same, has the same social circles, etc, has been found to influence up to 80% of our decisions. Research has also found that 75% of investors hire and invest through their networks. Quite obviously, therefore, in an industry dominated by men, the probability of women getting hired and women-led ventures finding backing, is rather low.So, we have a problem with fewer women in positions of influence and power, leading to fewer women finding their way in. And thus goes the circle.Stereotypes play a large part when we look at factors influencing low participation of women in India's workforce, no matter what sector. Which is why the role model or mentor who can enable self-confidence and independence is so important in fixing this skewed situation.The strength of female camaraderie can be an effective way to highlight how a strong community and network can create success for women. Even more significant is the fact that talent and ambition are qualities that largely remain unrecognised and unappreciated. Research shows that the presence of women in an investor's team itself has a positive correlation with the presence of women-led companies in the investment portfolio.Women can offer a fresh perspective and lead to a solution with better outcomes. It is essentially about disrupting groupthink and status quo. Importance of the female perspective in decision-making has gained recognition with investors in sectors such as consumer products, where women have significant influence as consumers. However, many ideas that look at untapped opportunities with women as target customers continue to struggle in convincing the male investor.The industry is a long way from appreciating and building the value of diverse perspectives in decision-making across the board. The story doesn't end there. Just as Laapataa Ladies effortlessly integrates various lessons on the journey of women in entrepreneurship, there is also a solid message on the role that men can also play in creating equity and equality for women.The  today has many such male allies, champions for change, who are pushing the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) agenda within their firms and portfolios. We need a lot more. As we look to the future, it's imperative we work together to dismantle the barriers that constrain women.

29,"Redevelopment projects: 8 common mistakes housing societies make when embarking on redevelopment, how to avoid it","Twelve years after initiating redevelopment, members of a housing complex in south Mumbai’s prime sea-facing locality are still far from seeing their cherished homes restored. Enticed into signing with a  of dubious reputation, the former residents are regretting their decision. Mismanagement by the developer has brought the entire project to a standstill. Danish Patel, a 58-year-old resident, laments, “The developer went out of his way to pitch for our society’s  when others were showing limited interest. However, he abandoned the project midway when it became unviable for him due to his own mismanagement.”On paper, redevelopment promises a big opportunity for members of a housing society. Alas, it often becomes a noose around their necks. Many redevelopment projects today are paralysed, with developers known to abandoning ongoing projects or delaying work indefinitely due to lack of funds or unviability. Society members are left at the mercy of the developer, without a home for years and forced to rent alternative accommodations. In this story, we dissect the typical  housing  make when  on redevelopment.Redevelopment is currently a hotbed of activity in India’s major residential markets. Both older residential societies and standalone plot owners are increasingly opting for redevelopment. Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group, says, “Redevelopment, particularly in urban areas, where space is scarce, is a very active trend as it enhances the quality of life, optimises land use efficiency, and renovates dilapidated structures.”Mumbai is witnessing the highest redevelopment activity, with over 31,000 projects approved as of May 2024. In Pune and Delhi/NCR, many ageing colonies and bungalows are opting for redevelopment. Ahmedabad and Surat are also seeing a surge in such projects. While redevelopment has generally been executed by tier 2 and tier 3 developers, several leading developers, including Ajmera Realty, Mahindra Lifespaces, Puravankara, and Rustomjee, have now entered the fray with the financial capability to handle these projects. Builders are attracted by the significant profit potential from selling the extra inventory left after allocating units to original members, allowing them to pocket the gains from the saleable area.The push for redevelopment among housing societies is well-founded. Old housing societies face numerous issues, including low resale value due to poor building conditions, lack of common amenities like elevators, absence of safe play areas for children, and a history of leaks, notes Neha Gupta, Principal Associate, Athena Legal. When executed correctly, redevelopment offers a host of benefits to society members, with the primary goal being safer living conditions for the residents. Shubhi Jain, Principal Partner & Head of CRM, Square Yards, remarks, “Redevelopment is crucial for older societies grappling with unsafe infrastructure and outdated construction standards, ensuring resident safety and compliance with modern .”The lifestyle transformation is another pull factor. “When land prices soar, redevelopment becomes an attractive option for societies to unlock the value of their land and get bigger, more modern apartments,” says Samir Jasuja, CEO, PropEquity. Government regulations in some areas permit a higher Floor Space Index (FSI) during redevelopment, enabling societies to construct additional floors and increase the total living area. Additionally, redevelopment facilitates the inclusion of modern amenities such as gyms, swimming pools, improved waste management systems, and enhanced parking facilities, notes Swapnil Anil, Executive Director & Head, Advisory Services, Colliers India. This not only boosts the resale value of individual units, but also offers significant gains for those looking to sell.Despite its benefits, redevelopment can be fraught with challenges. Here are some common mistakes to avoid so that redevelopment does not become costly and problematic. REDEVELOPMENT OF a housing society cannot succeed without full cooperation from its residents. The entire process can be derailed by internal discord or lack of trust in the builder. Jasuja emphasises that a breakdown in communication is a major stumbling block in redevelopment projects. “Lack of transparency and clear communication with residents about project goals, expectations, and potential challenges can breed mistrust and hinder co-operation,” Jasuja cautions. “Poor communication and consensus-building among stakeholders often result in resistance and increased costs,” contends Jain. Regular updates, clear communication of timelines and costs, and open forums for questions are crucial, insists Anil.Housing societies sometimes proceed with redevelopment without securing adequate consent from existing members. “Legally, most jurisdictions require a supermajority (typically 75% or more) of member approval. Failing to achieve this can lead to legal challenges from dissenting members,” remarks Gupta. While it is best to get everyone on board to avoid hiccups later, the law usually favours the majority in disputes. “Numerous judgements have upheld that members of a cooperative housing society who are in a minority cannot obstruct a redevelopment project unless they can prove that there is some prejudice caused to them or there are elements of fraud in the process of redevelopment,” observes Dilip Shah, Senior Counsellor and Analyst for Redevelopment of Housing Societies.IF MISTRUST IS a ticking time bomb, placing blind faith in representatives is akin to stepping on a banana peel. Society members often yield to the decisions of the managing committee, whether willingly or under pressure. Experts caution against trusting housing society office-bearers blindly, especially in matters of redevelopment. Shah points out, “There are numerous instances where members of the managing committee are enticed with unlawful gratifications by unscrupulous developers, who use these members as agents to push through rosy dreams to innocent society residents.” Such members cannot be trusted to finalise any agreements with the developer in a transparent manner. Residents must stay vigilant to ensure their interests are properly represented. It’s also crucial for committee members not to be weak. Lacking knowledge and negotiation skills could jeopardise the society’s interests, according to Jasuja. MANY REDEVELOPMENT projects fail because housing societies become too greedy. While reviewing proposals, some choose the developer promising the largest living space and highest rental payouts. However, it is essential to question whether this generosity is viable for the developer and if he can deliver on his commitment. “The success of redevelopment projects is closely tied to their financial viability,” insists Jasuja. If the developer is offering bigger living space than others, it could leave him with less saleable area for the new buyers in the revamped complex. If the finances don’t work out for the builder, the project could ultimately get derailed. Similarly, demanding higher rental commitments or a larger corpus fund from a builder may cause problems if his cash flows don’t materialise as expected.Before getting carried away by a lucrative offer, get a feasibility study done, insists Jayesh Rathod, Director, The Guardians Real Estate Advisory. “Unless the developer makes money on it, the project cannot get completed.” Determine the market value of the property after redevelopment to avoid quoting unrealistic figures that could deter builders or lead to dissatisfaction, Anil advises. In Danish Patel’s housing complex, members were enticed by the high rental payout offered by the builder, but no feasibility study was conducted. After a few years, the rental payouts stopped. This is a common experience for many housing societies.Redevelopment will accelerate as demand exceeds supply in metros. ANAROCK ResearchHousing societies must be careful in their choice of developer.PropEquitySELECTING THE right developer is critical in the redevelopment process, and many societies err here. Experts advise prioritising a developer’s reputation for timely execution over maximum gains. “Never select a developer simply on the basis of his financial offers of increase in carpet area or promises to provide world class amenities,” says Shah.Choose on merit, reputation, technical capability, experience and financial status. “Partnering with an inexperienced or unreliable developer can lead to poor construction quality, delays and financial trouble,” warns Jasuja.Review the builder’s finances, including income-tax returns, with a trusted chartered accountant. Determine if the developer plans to self-fund the project or take a loan, as a higher loan increases risk. Rathod suggests society members meet with representatives from other societies that have worked with the builder to better understand their credentials.MANY HOUSING societies rush into redevelopment projects without proper legal framework in place. First, it is critical that the society’s managing committee be elected as per legal provisions. Second, after lawful elections, every committee member must file an indemnity bond within 15 days of assuming charge. Without these, the entire society can be considered non-existent, making any redevelopment efforts legally untenable. “Any resolutions passed and execution of documents can be considered void. Handing over of the society property to the developer for redevelopment could also be considered unauthorised,” points out Shah.Further, the process can get derailed if the society does not conduct general body meetings with the required quorum and other legal necessities. Among other things, a structural audit report is essential for deciding between redevelopment or major repairs; without it, the general body meeting cannot legally approve redevelopment, remarks Anil. Additionally, if the society doesn’t have the plot conveyed in its name via a conveyance deed, it must first get it executed. Without a conveyance deed, the housing society is not considered the owner of the property. If the earlier developer is not cooperating, the society can secure a deemed conveyance after a lengthy legal process.NEXT, BE meticulous in drafting the agreement with the developer. Weak, hurriedly drafted contracts are at the heart of most disputed projects. “Without a solid legal foundation, disputes are almost inevitable. Contracts that lack clarity or are poorly drafted can lead to significant misunderstandings and conflicts,” remarks Gupta. It is essential for housing societies to engage experienced legal professionals to draft contracts that cover all possible scenarios, including timelines, financial terms, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Do not proceed with any agreement drafted by the builder without approval from a trusted lawyer.Ensure individual agreements are secured from each member with the developer before vacating the premises. Ensure that rights to additional FSI/TDR are exclusively in the name of the housing society. Specify the timeline for possession handover and penalties for delays in the development agreement. Include an exit clause, allowing the society to terminate the agreement in case of non-performance. Clearly outline amenities and allocate car parking spaces to existing members. Include a clause stipulating that all construction-related expenses are borne by the developer. Define rental compensation terms for existing members during the construction period.A REDEVELOPMENT project cannot go through without obtaining the necessary approvals from municipal authorities and regulatory bodies. Housing societies often neglect this, leading to legal complications that can halt the project. “Ensuring that all necessary permits and approvals are in place before starting the project is crucial,” insists Gupta. In many jurisdictions, obtaining environmental clearances is mandatory for redevelopment projects. Failure to secure these clearances can prompt legal action from environmental agencies and NGOs, resulting in substantial delays and financial repercussions, according to Gupta. Similarly, noncompliance with local building codes and regulations may lead to legal repercussions from municipal authorities. Therefore, it is crucial for housing societies to ensure strict adherence to all applicable building codes, zoning laws, and safety regulations during the redevelopment process. AT TIMES, unscrupulous developers may make unauthorised alterations to the proposed layout or infrastructure, including encroaching on neighbouring properties or public land. These violations often surface only after significant progress. Such actions can prove detrimental to the housing society, potentially leading to lawsuits from affected parties or refusal by municipal authorities to issue a completion certificate. “Blatant violation of rules by the builder through unlawful planning and construction of additional, unauthorised areas beyond their entitlement impels the society towards litigation at a later date,” Shah warns. To avoid future issues, the society should ensure they obtain written consent from the cooperative society’s architect before making any alterations to flat layouts, building plans, parking spaces, or recreational areas.By taking these precautionary steps, older housing societies can approach this complex exercise with more confidence and ensure the project remains on track."

31,"Growth to hold steady, but global risks Remain: FinMin","The  on Thursday said  would remain steady in the coming quarters as  gathers pace after the general election and the rural economy strengthens, but navigating continuing global uncertainties, especially the fallout of likely rate cuts by advanced economies, would remain a challenge.The current slowdown in auto and fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) sales in urban areas, the ministry said in its monthly economic review for August, may turn out to be transient with the advent of the peak festive season but these ""signs of weakness"" in  warrant monitoring. The economy has expanded 27% between FY21 and FY24, more than offsetting the pandemic-induced slump, it said. The June quarter growth of 6.7%, too, was driven by a broad-based rebound in non-farm sectors.""In the absence of any serious adverse climate shocks, rural incomes and demand should get stronger, and  will be milder,"" it said.The inflation trajectory is going to be positive as benign core inflation, good monsoon, and healthy sowing progress of  are likely to keep price pressure under control, the ministry said.Kharif sowing has picked up, brightening prospects of farm production. Adequately replenished reservoir levels will potentially boost the upcoming Rabi crops as well and the skewed spatial distribution of rain may have only limited impact on farm output in a few regions.""Mirroring the strong build-up in productive activity, the major components of aggregate demand, including private consumption, fixed investment and exports, have picked up pace,"" it added.Most high-frequency gauges--including GST mop-up, expansionary trends in the purchasing managers' indices and growth in air and port cargo--indicate vigorous economic activity and continuing expansion in the September quarter.The report stayed with the Economic Survey's projection of a real growth rate of 6.5 -7% for FY25.Fixed investment grew 7.5% in the June quarter from a year before despite subdued growth in public capex during the election signals ""the strengthening of the  cycle"", the report said.Net payroll additions under the EPFO picked up in the June quarter, ""signalling a rebound in formal job creation"".As global demand remains subdued, India's  have barely grown this fiscal but strong domestic consumption has boosted imports, the ministry said, explaining the reason for India's elevated goods trade deficit in recent months.Apart from the ""incipient signs of strains"" in certain sectors, as reflected in a slowdown in auto and FMCG sales in urban India, the report also flagged moderation in capital spending by states this fiscal."
32,This Delhi NCR region likely to see a 30% hike in circle rate for residential areas; how homebuyers will be impacted,"The stamps and registration department has proposed to the district magistrate to update the circle rates, which have remained unchanged for the last five years. “The proposal aims at increasing the  by 25-30% in residential areas, 10% in industrial, commercial and IT sectors, and 15% in case of farmland,” stated a  news report.District magistrate Manish Verma told Times of India that the new circle rates would be announced for public feedback in two days.The updated circle rates will impact  in different categories, leading buyers to pay higher . The circle rates were last revised on August 8, 2019. Usually, circle rates are revised annually and implemented from Aug 1. Officials told  that the circle rates will remain unchanged from 2020 to 2023 due to the real estate sector's downturn caused by the lockdown.Earlier this year in Ghaziabad, the stamps and registration department suggested increasing circle rates by 15% to 20% for residential and commercial properties, following a two-year freeze.Stamp duty for a property is calculated based on the circle rate set by the district administration or the land allotment rate established by three development authorities — Noida, Greater Noida, and Yamuna Expressway — in their respective areas, whichever is higher. These authorities typically update their allotment rates every six months to a year.Shashi Bhanu Mishra, assistant inspector-general of registration, told the , ""Yes, the stamps and registration department has submitted a proposal to the district magistrate to revise the rates. Circle rates have remained unchanged since 2019. The cost of flats has gone up considerably in Noida and Greater Noida over the past few years. In comparison, the stamp duty collected — which is based on the circle rate — is much lower. The rates should be revised to close this gap somewhat.""Here is a look at how you will be impacted, as per the Times of India news report. In Noida, the rates will vary for sectors and categories like residential, commercial, industrial, and IT.For instance, the rate for residential plots in Noida sectors 14 and 14A is around Rs 1,1 lakh per sqm, while it is Rs 79,200 in Sector 19.In Greater Noida's Alpha 1, 2, and Gamma 2, the circle rate is Rs 37,000 per sqm.The circle rate is the minimum price for a residential or commercial property to be registered for sale or transfer. This rate is set by the state government or development authorities and can vary between different areas within the same city. Circle rates are designed to prevent artificially inflated prices and speculation in the real estate market. It's important to note that the circle rate is not the property's actual market price and may be lower than the prevailing market rates.Circle rates play a crucial role in ensuring transparency, fairness, and standardization in property transactions. Understanding the calculation of circle rates and their significance can help both buyers and sellers navigate the real estate market more effectively. Moreover, being mindful of how circle rates can impact land values can be advantageous when making decisions about real estate investments."
33,Comments on Dalits: BJP MLA’s arrest leaves party in tight spot,"Four-time BJP MLA from RR Nagar in Bengaluru,  has been taken into custody by the City Police after they formally arrested him on Saturday on charges of hurling slurs on a member of the SC community and demanding bribes from the municipal contractor.The police intercepted his vehicle on the Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border district of Kolar as he tried to leave the state on Saturday and arrested him after the Bengaluru police registered two FIRs against him.He was a  lawmaker earlier, who switched over to the BJP in 2019 along with other Congress and JDS lawmakers, helping the BJP form the government.Trouble for the 60-year old BJP lawmaker began after audio-tapes containing an alleged conversation between him and Cheluvaraju, a contractor, emerged in which a person, alleged as the BJP leader, could be heard using abusive language against the SC community while pressing for his dues of his share of bribes. He identifies the contractor by his community (Vokkaliga) and makes obscene references to his wife and mother.The SC community leader referred to in the conversation Velu Naikar filed a police complaint under the  while the contractor lodged his complaint under the Prevention of Corruption Act.The BJP disciplinary committee has issued a notice to Naidu seeking his explanation within five days. The MLA, however, has termed the audio tapes as doctored ones and a conspiracy by the local Congress leaders, pointing to former Congress MP DK Suresh.A delegation of Congress ministers and MLAs, from the , will meet the CM on Monday morning and urge him to take stern action against the BJP MLA for `lowering’ the dignity of Vokkaliga woman, seeking to further tighten the screws on him who has been under a siege. Suresh, who is also the brother of Dy CM DK Shivakumar, however, denied any role, and urged the BJP and JDS to clarify their stand on the alleged comments by the BJP MLA. ""Please clarify if your party’s stand is the same as yours? How would you have reacted if a Congress leader had spoken like this?,” Suresh told the media. In the recent Lok Sabha polls, the three-time Congress MP lost to BJP's Dr CN Manjunath.The ugly episode has surfaced at a time when the BJP-JDS combine has been running a sustained campaign targeting Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his government, over the allotment of 14 housing plots to CM's wife in Mysuru and unlawful diversion of funds meant for ST welfare to a few individuals.The Muniratna arrest has come as a major embarrassment to the BJP, whose leadership has distanced itself from the case in a subtle message to the MLA that he would have to defend himself and come out clean. The Congress, on the other hand, has been projecting the BJP as anti-Dalits and anti-Vokkaligas after the audio tapes emerged."

38,Property prices in this Bengaluru area jumped by 90% in 5 years; how much housing price has risen in your city,"Residential property prices have surged across India’s top cities over the last five years, driven by robust demand and an increase in new supply, stated a recent report by ANAROCK Research. Among the short-listed localities by the real-estate consultant, Bengaluru's Bagaluru area emerged as the frontrunner, witnessing a staggering 94% increase in residential prices between 2019 and the first half of the 2024. The average property prices in this area jumped from Rs 4,300 per square foot in 2019 to approximately Rs 8,151 per square foot in H1 2024. During this period, around 17,065 new units were launched in Bagaluru, predominantly in the mid and premium segments — Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore. Notably, there was no new affordable supply in this locality, says Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group.""Bagaluru’s transformation reflects a growing preference for premium living amidst increasing urbanization and economic growth. With demand outpacing supply, it’s clear why developers are focusing on higher-end offerings,"" Puri adds. Hyderabad’s Kokapet closely followed with an 89% price appreciation during the five-year period. The average residential price in this micro-market rose from Rs 4,750 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,000 per square foot as of H1 2024, bolstered by approximately 12,920 new units. Interestingly, over half (52%) of the new supply fell into the ultra-luxury category, priced above Rs 2.5 crore, indicating a trend towards luxury living.With 80% rise in average residential property prices, Bengaluru's Whitefield ranked third. Average property price climbed from Rs 4,765 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 8,600 per square foot in H1 2024 in the micro-market. This area saw a total of 18,600 units launched, with 66% categorised in the mid-and-premium segments.As per the report, NCR’s (National Capital Region) Dwarka Expressway ranked fourth. It saw a 79% price surge in the residential housing property. Average housing prices in this area increased from Rs 5,359 per square foot in 2019 to over Rs 9,600 per square foot in H12024.Bengaluru’s Sarjapur Road clocked in at fifth with a 58% price jump. The average prices here rose from Rs 5,870 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,300 per square foot in H1 2024.Hyderabad’s Bachupally came in sixth with average property prices increasing by 57% in the period – from Rs 3,690 per square foot in 2019 to over Rs 5,800 per square foot in H1 2024. Hyderabad’s Tellapur ranked seventh, with average property prices surging by 53%, from Rs 4,819 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 7,350 per square foot in H1 2024.Following closely, MMR’s Panvel secured the eighth position, witnessing a 50% increase in property prices during the same period. Prices here climbed from Rs 5,520 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 8,300 per square foot in H1 2024.NCR’s New Gurugram, occupying the ninth spot, recorded a 48% rise in average property prices, which escalated from Rs 6,100 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,000 per square foot in H1 2024.Lastly, MMR’s Dombivli experienced a 40% increase in average prices, with housing prices from Rs 6,625 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,300 per square foot in H1 2024.Puri explains, “The general belief that increased supply restricts price growth is not always applicable. Many active residential micro-markets have defied this trend. For instance, Greater Noida West, despite significant new supply, saw a remarkable 129% price appreciation.”As cities continue to evolve and attract a diverse range of buyers, including professionals and investors, the demand for housing remains robust. With urbanisation on the rise and new projects continuously being launched, the trajectory for property prices seems poised for sustained growth, creating both opportunities and challenges for prospective buyers and developers alike.In conclusion, as the housing market adapts to post-pandemic realities, the balance of demand and supply will be crucial in shaping the future landscape of residential real estate in India’s major cities."

Other MPC members of the Reserve Bank of India () expressed concerns over the current global and domestic economic uncertainty, underscoring the need to remain vigilant about  and sustained growth. This made the case for keeping the  unchanged, showed the minutes of the last MPC review published Wednesday by the central bank.""Given that inflationary expectations have been successfully anchored, and industrial demand in both domestic as well as export markets is flagging, a rate cut could help to revive demand and help boost private investment,"" said Nagesh Kumar, director of the Institute for Studies in Industrial Development, defending his first vote as MPC member. ""I think that it is an opportune moment for RBI to start the process of normalizing the monetary policy,"" said Kumar, the lone member to seek a cut in rates.Nevertheless, among those who voted for a pause, deputy governor Michael Patra said that the second-quarter slowdown could be temporary, attributing it to ""idiosyncratic factors like unusually heavy rainfall in the retreat of the southwest monsoon and pitrupaksha"".In the October 6-9 policy statement, five out of the six members voted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.50% for the 10th consecutive bi-monthly meeting of the MPC. All six members unanimously voted for a change in stance to 'neutral' from 'withdrawal of accommodation'.""The change in stance to neutral provides space to watch out for the uncertainties on the horizon - ranging from heightened geopolitical tensions, volatile commodity prices and risks of adverse weather in food inflation,"" said RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das. ""At this stage of the economic cycle, we cannot risk another bout of inflation. The best approach now would be to remain flexible and wait for more evidence of inflation aligning durably with the target,"" he said.The committee is taking a gradual wait-and-assess approach, as reducing restraint too quickly may negate the progress made on disinflation. Enterprises also expect demand conditions to pick up for manufacturers, services and infrastructure.With the consumer price index (CPI) expected to be higher, the confidence of CPI coming to the target of 4% in the near future comes from the household inflation expectations survey which has been lower in the latest print, according to the minutes.

44,"View: Don't eat the rich, it'll hurt the rest","On May 24, Thomas 's World  Lab released a follow-up note to its earlier published paper, 'Income and Wealth , 1922-2023: The Rise of the Billionaire Raj'. The note, 'Proposals for a  Package to Tackle Extreme Inequalities in ', advocates imposing a 2%  on net wealth exceeding ₹10 cr, and a 33% inheritance tax to deal with the problem of rising inequality, and to generate extra resources to be spent on education, health and welfare programmes.The study estimates that the measure would affect only 0.4% of the adult population, while generating additional resources worth 2.73% of , or around ₹9 lakh cr. It also highlighted inter-caste disparities, pointing that HNIs in India mostly belong to upper castes, and the measure would, therefore, be aligned with social justice.Many countries have attempted to tax the  through these taxes without success. They fundamentally militate against simple economic logic - disproportionate amounts are spent on their collection, and evasions are easy. Wealth is difficult to assess, and can be easily hidden in agricultural or real estates. The taxes also disincentivise enterprise and lead to flight of capital, affecting .India had a wealth tax since 1957 till FY15 when it was replaced by a surcharge at rates that now range from 10% to 25% on the income-tax paid by HNIs if their taxable income exceeded ₹50 lakh under the new tax regime. The Wealth Tax Act 1957 levied 1% on individuals and corporates on their net wealth exceeding ₹30 lakh, which included land and houses, furniture, transport, jewellery and cash exceeding ₹50,000, besides assets transferred to spouse and children.In FY15, wealth tax yielded only ₹1,086 cr of total tax revenue of ₹12 lakh cr, while cost of collection was ₹695 cr, including that on securities and transaction tax. The surcharge that replaced it generated ₹1,565 cr in FY16 without any additional cost, and has since grown to ₹73,000 cr as estimated in the current budget. That is a much better way to handle  than the solution suggested by Piketty et al, which would inevitably drain domestic and foreign investments and stymie growth. The country will then wallow in 'equal ' for all.Inequality is the cost of growth, but less of a problem when other measures are in place to mitigate the problems of vulnerable groups. There is now a strong social security net for that in the form of free or highly subsidised food grains through various schemes that ensure food security for 80 cr Indians, and Ayushman Bharat that covers 50 cr people.Multidimensional poverty in India as estimated by NITI Aayog was only 11% in 2022-23, as compared to nearly 30% a decade back. Compare this with 22% ratio when poverty was estimated last by the Planning Commission in FY12, based on monthly per-capita consumption expenditure.Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality on a scale of 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (highest inequality) was then 0.33. A recent SBI research paper states that this has risen to 0.40 as of FY23, but down from 0.47 in FY15. Inequality is not something to lose our sleep over. Rich OECD countries having wealth tax have declined in number from 12 in 1990 to only 5 now.It's almost the same story with inheritance tax. India introduced it in the form of estate duty in 1953 to tax all inherited movable and immovable properties, including agricultural land, with rates reaching a peak of 85%. It was abolished in 1985 due to its high administrative cost against meagre collections - only ₹3.45 cr in that year.Quite a few rich countries levy an inheritance tax - France 60%, Japan 55%, South Korea and Germany 50%, and Britain and the US 40% - but it doesn't seem to correlate with inequality. In India, with lot of benami properties, its implementation has always been, and will be, difficult. Both these taxes have rather been used to harass individuals, before and even after death.There is no economic logic behind them, and there is no evidence that they improve equality or reduce poverty. A 2000 World Bank study found that 87% of the cumulative decline in poverty came from growth in consumption as a result of income growth, while redistribution contributed to only 13%. The conclusion seems inescapable - the only thing that matters is growth.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

50,Big plate of supply-side up: Why economies can’t redistribute their way to prosperity,"As the dust settles after general elections, the market's attention is shifting towards the new government's policy agenda for the next five years. There has been some discourse on whether India needs to pivot its policy direction more towards , or dial up its focus on boosting infrastructure investment and maintaining tax incentives to encourage private investment.Advocating for one policy over the other involves either political arguments - the electorate has expressed its preference for A or B via the EVM - or economic ones - whether or not a certain course of action would be better for . Frustratingly, this is often presented as a trade-off.Poll outcomes have consistently favoured incumbents when the trailing macro backdrop is moderate-to-high growth with moderate inflation. For instance, when you consider the trends in the government's revenue deficit (a measure of its redistribution efforts) in the run-up to the polls, an elevated level of revenue deficit is not usually associated with the incumbent government staying in power, like in 2004 and 2014.Consider another metric: real growth of incomes for the bottom 20% of the population. Data from the World Inequality Database shows that over 1999-2003 and 2009-13, real incomes for India's bottom quintile grew by 1.3% CAGR.By contrast, between 2004-08 and 2014-18, growth rates were 3.4% and 5%. History shows us that excessive redistributive policies, and poor implementation of such policies, do not contribute to lifting growth or enhance job opportunities for the poor in the long run.This course of action also generates higher inflation, which affects the lower-income segment and limits any attendant  reduction impact. In other words, while aggressive redistribution may create the headline illusion of helping the poor, the truth is that it creates inflation and macro stability risks, which hurt them. Simply put, economies cannot redistribute their way to prosperity.The tried-and-tested approach to growing an economy, lifting per-capita incomes and alleviating poverty sustainably, is to focus on supply-side reforms to lift public and private investment. This approach has worked in many East Asian economies and India's historical context. By helping boost investment, supply-side reforms help accelerate productivity, job creation and income growth, reducing poverty effectively over the medium term.Some argue that GoI has followed this approach in recent years without success. But such judgements don't consider the tough global context. The economy faced two major shocks: the pandemic in 2020, and the subsequent global inflationary backdrop.The investment-driven growth approach, which was always going to take time, therefore, suffered an extended setback, limiting the trickle-down benefits to lower-income households. Real income growth in 2022-23 was strong at around 5.8%. But the difficult global factors hampered the average growth figure for the period, coming in at 2.2%, slower than the preceding five years.Another criticism of the supply-side developmental model is that it can perpetuate - or even exacerbate - income inequality. Yes, this can be seen as a frustrating outcome. But lifting people out of poverty is a more important goal at this juncture than reducing inequality. World Bank data shows that 13% of India's population still sits below the poverty level, and that the country's per-capita incomes are still very low by global standards.Inequality metrics in China are also high. But the strong trailing growth has helped to eliminate poverty. Managing higher investment growth and maintaining macro stability - especially inflation - remains the best approach for maximising social welfare.To be sure, no one is suggesting that redistribution efforts be eliminated. It's only that it shouldn't be the case that redistributive policies can't be taken to such an extent that it affects macro stability like it did in 2009 and 2013 when inflation averaged close to 10%. If these programmes distort labour market incentives and the productivity dynamic, it will create real challenges for macro stability. At the starting point, India's revenue expenditure, excluding defence and interest payments, is relatively high. Policymakers should focus on improving effectiveness of spending on social welfare, such as education and healthcare.With this in mind, policymakers should persist with supply-side reforms. The current long-term forecast for real GDP growth is 6.5%, and for inflation, 4%. This growth cycle should be similar to the 2003-07 cycle, where investment is followed by urban and then rural consumption growth. Some elements of this have already played out, and policy continuity will help entrench these positive trends.However, to create an environment of higher growth of around 8-10% with low inflation, an even sharper focus on supply-side reforms is needed to generate enough employment opportunities to absorb India's rapidly growing labour force. Reforms to boost farm productivity, a continued surge in infra spending, continued deregulation and reforms to skill the workforce will be key.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

52,Investing in youth-led community development for lasting change,"55-year old Ashok Behera is a resident of Mangalajodi, a wetland connected to the Chilika lagoon in Khordha, Odisha. A large population lives around this wetland and depends on fishing in the Chilika river for their livelihood. Behera had to helplessly witness the shrinking of the lake due to climate change, heavy siltation, dumping of waste and overgrowth of bamboo grass which forced him and his children to leave their ancestral home in search of a more secure future elsewhere.This story, as documented by UNICEF in 2022, isn't uncommon. Across India, countless citizens and communities grapple with environmental challenges, threatening their livelihoods and forcing displacement.However, amidst this despair lies a beacon of hope – the power of youth-led community initiatives. In Mangalajodi, it was the collective action of young people that stemmed the tide of migration. Through innovative WASH Guardian training modules, support from entrepreneurs, and awareness drives, they tackled the root causes of the degradation of Chilika lake. Behera, too mobilised villagers to build an institute of mitigating such crises in the future. They all created an inclusive process for the protection of left-out wetlands. Combined efforts were also initiated to protect the bird habitats around the wetland.The young people of Mangalajodi didn't wait for someone else to solve their problems. They stepped up, became leaders, and spearheaded positive change. Their story exemplifies the immense potential young people hold to address critical issues. When we empower them with the resources and support they need, they can become the driving force behind a brighter future for their communities.Youth-led development places the power for change directly in the hands of the very people who will inherit the consequences of that development. It's a shift from a passive beneficiary model to one of active ownership and empowerment, equipping them to identify challenges, co-create solutions, and become active participants in shaping their urban landscape. This fosters a deeper sense of belonging and responsibility, leading to initiatives that are more contextually relevant and likely to endure.Take the story of 11-year-old Prasiddhi Singh who began her ‘green activist’ journey after witnessing the devastating loss of tree cover in the 2016 Vardah cyclone. At age four, she participated in plantation drives around her neighbourhood, engaged with NGOs and like-minded folk. Giving nature a chance to breathe again, Prasiddhi started the ‘Prasiddhi Forest Foundation’ in 2018 in Chengalpattu with the intent to increase green cover, nurture biodiversity and make recycling a way of life. Today, her foundation has planted more than 100,000 trees. Their efforts not only contributed to a greener city but also inspired countless others to take action. But for every Prasiddhi, there are countless other young minds waiting to be nurtured and empowered. Investing in youth-led development goes beyond financial resources. True impact lies in a fundamental shift: listening to young voices and extending support through partnerships.Mentorship and access to role models are key pillars of this approach, providing guidance that can help them translate their ideas into action and give them a tangible path to follow.Equally important is collaboration that bridges the gap between  and CSOs, government agencies and the private sectors to create a synergistic ecosystem of support.Technology also serves as a powerful enabler. Platforms such as Instagram and YouTube offer opportunities for outreach and advocacy, while crowdfunding provides a means of financial support independent of traditional funding sources.  But perhaps most crucial of all is the creation of safe spaces – physical and virtual environments where young people can connect, learn, and share ideas free from judgment. These spaces serve as incubators for innovation, fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment that is essential for .Creating lasting changeWhile top-down development models have played their role in , it is time we also recognise the immense potential of investing in youth-led initiatives for creating lasting and  in our cities.By investing in , we invest in a brighter future for our cities. We  to become agents of change, build stronger communities, and create a more equitable and sustainable urban landscape. It's time for us – corporations, policymakers, and civil society to recognise that the solutions to our most pressing challenges lie not in isolation but in collaboration and collective action.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

56,Dubai’s ‘sustainable city’ was supposed to start a trend. It hasn’t yet,"In 2017, Leonardo DiCaprio paid a secret visit to  to check out a new housing development with unique bragging rights. Boasting 600 homes, 11 bio-domes and an urban farm running through its center, the project known as  claimed to be the Gulf’s most environmentally sustainable community — and a potential model for a greener future. Seven years and 1.3 billion dirhams ($354 million) in construction costs later, only some parts of that claim have been realized. Sustainable City now has about 3,000 residents and is one of a few low-carbon developments in one of the world’s harshest climates. It generates a significant amount of its own electricity, and combines technology with traditional architecture to keep residents cool and comfortable without maxing out energy use. But Sustainable City has yet to start a trend. After a push for greener development in the early aughts, and despite big promises at the United Nations’ climate conference in Dubai last year, the United Arab Emirates is still severely lacking in buildings and communities that speak to its  goals. Sustainable City was supposed to be a blueprint; it’s still just an anomaly. “There was a period of time when there was a desire to do world-beating levels of ,” says Karim Elgendy, an associate fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House. “I don’t think that’s there anymore. It required the major transformation of the construction industry itself.”The period of time Elgendy is referring to hit its peak in 2006, when Abu Dhabi announced plans to pump nearly $20 billion into an idea known as , a 2.5-square-mile neighborhood that would be close to carbon-neutral, thanks to clean-energy wizardry, LEED-certified building design and a solar farm. Foster + Partners, the architectural firm behind Masdar City’s initial design, drew inspiration from medieval Arab and European cities, leaning on ample greenery and strategically deployed shade to keep spaces cool. The development was slated to house 50,000 residents, and was pitched as the world’s first zero-carbon, zero-waste city.While Masdar City was under construction, Faris Saeed, a Jordanian civil engineer and founder of Diamond Developers, was building skyscrapers in Dubai’s Marina neighborhood. Then the 2008 financial crisis hit, decimating many developers and pushing the city to the brink of bankruptcy. Interest waned in navigating the cost and complexity of sustainable construction, and lackluster demand from buyers capped developers’ nascent  ambitions.     Saeed saw opportunity. “We started to think, ‘How can we build a unique, possibly more immune model?’” he says. “We wanted to perfect green and sustainable development, but we knew that if it isn’t commercially viable it won’t work.”In 2012, SEE Holding — Diamond Developers’ holding company, also owned by Saeed — bought a 460,000-square-meter (5 million-square-foot) stretch of desert on the outskirts of Dubai, with plans to build a community that would differentiate itself through sustainable design. Right away, there were snags. SEE struggled to convince banks to extend loans to the project once they heard about the sustainability angle. Saeed said he routinely went back to bankers with assurances that Sustainable City would work just like a traditional housing development. But buyers weren’t sold, either. When Sustainable City broke ground in 2014, Saeed hung a banner outside the construction site promising that it would collect “zero service fees,” which are akin to condominium fees that offset maintenance costs. (Sustainable City allocates 40% of the revenue from its mall to make up the difference.) That benefit did the trick: By the time construction was in full swing, 60% of Sustainable City had been pre-sold. Residents started moving into the community in 2016, but another perk came four years later, when HSBC allocated its first “green mortgages” in the UAE to Sustainable City homeowners. The loans offer an interest rate discount of 0.25% for properties that meet certain sustainable criteria and a 50% reduction in bank-processing fees, according to the lender. Saeed says that many of the current owners bought after living there for several years as renters. Today, Sustainable City is fully occupied, with a three-year waitlist for families looking to move there. (Saeed still owns 10% of the homes, which are rented.) Alongside its 500 villas and 89 apartments, the development has a school, retail space, and equestrian club, plus one of the region’s largest schools for autistic children. Its urban farm and 11 bio-dome greenhouses yield produce that’s sold to nearby restaurants and supermarkets. About 80% of Sustainable City is car-free, with paved pathways for cycling and shared electric buggies for travel between houses. Clusters of homes share parking lots — shaded with solar panels — on the development’s outskirts, which means residents must walk to their cars, even during Dubai’s hot and humid summers. (Many housing developments in the city include either underground parking or parking in front of one’s villa.)Throughout the development, architecture is geared at reducing direct sunlight and ensuring proper insulation. Saeed says his buildings use 40% less water thanks to special fixtures, leading to 30% less sewage. A biogas plant converts organic waste into energy, and solar panels are mounted on every roof. The development generates 80% of its own energy in winter and 40% in summer, when the temperature routinely tops 45C (113F). “We start with the financial,” Saeed says of his pitch to buyers. “Concern No. 1 to people is money, then comes social and environmental concerns.” The UAE has also evolved since Sustainable City’s debut. The country pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and announced plans to invest up to $54 billion in renewables by 2030. It ditched some fuel subsidies, started promoting public transit and introduced a corporate tax. When COP28, the UN’s climate conference, took place in Dubai last year, it was helmed by Sultan Al-Jaber, who also runs the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. Despite backlash over his appointment, the summit ended with the first-ever deal to move away from fossil fuels. That momentum will prove critical as the planet continues to warm, with countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council warming about twice as fast as the global average. The UAE has the second highest per-capita carbon footprint in the world, trailing only neighboring Qatar. Sustainable building design will become increasingly important as policymakers and business leaders are tasked with reducing energy use in a region where up to 70% of electricity goes to cooling homes. But the UAE still has a long way to go. The Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, which operates renewable projects in the US, UK and UAE, ranks 62nd in the world among renewable-energy companies, according to BloombergNEF. Masdar City, still conspicuously empty, casts an equally long shadow over the UAE’s green record. And Sustainable City largely stands on its own as a populated development built with greener living in mind. Elgendy at Chatham House says the model isn’t easily scalable, in large part because of the limitations on car use.“Sustainable City found an opportunity in a certain type of tenant and they framed it as a lifestyle,” he says. “I don’t think a typical Dubai resident is their typical customer. Without the policy incentives, it’s hard to see other developers doing more.”Dubai's government has hinted that forthcoming regulations would make the industry more sustainable, says Tatjana Lescova, associate director of corporate ratings at S&P Global. But for developers, more stringent environmental requirements could represent additional costs, administrative hurdles and technical challenges.Demand for LEED-certified commercial space has been growing in the city, according to a November report from CBRE Group Inc. That largely reflects a flight to quality: In Dubai, offices with LEED certification rent at roughly 34% higher rates than those without, according to the report. About 24% of the gross leasable area of assets that CBRE monitors in the city is now LEED-certified — a total of 12.2 million square feet. As of the third quarter, the average occupancy rate for those assets was 96%, up from 91% a year earlier. Saeed says he is planning another development in Dubai, though he didn’t provide details or a timeline. SEE Holding is also replicating its model elsewhere, building similar communities in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Oman — with a total of about 3,850 homes in planning or under construction and 4 billion dirhams ($1 billion) in pre-sales across all ongoing projects. The Oman development will produce all its own energy from renewable sources, Saeed says. It will also produce 70% of its own food and recycle all its own water. To fund those expansion efforts, SEE is planning an initial public offering of its business, including Sustainable City, according to people familiar with the matter. Late last year, the company was considering banks including Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc. to work on the IPO, which would also include its engineering, design and advisory units. Details such as the size and timing of the deal are still being discussed and may change, the people said.SEE is also mulling partnerships for projects in the US, Europe and Africa, and Saeed says he expects to conclude a deal in Cyprus in the next few months. To persuade partners and would-be buyers, he’s focused on keeping construction costs in line with those for traditional developments. SEE is also offering short-term rentals to counter surging home prices.But Elgendy warns that there are more uphill battles ahead. “It’s actually quite hard work. Even with all the smart technologies, all the passive architectural techniques that would reduce the need for air conditioning in the first place, the amount of air conditioning required for comfort is still too high for a few solar panels to manage,” he says. “There is a ceiling to sustainability and carbon emissions in the Gulf in general.”( Originally published on Mar 21, 2024 )"

Backed by  Jio Infocomm Ltd, the BharatGPT group, a consortium including the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay and Seetha Mahalakshmi Healthcare, launched India's own homegrown  foundational model called Hanooman AI, in May this year. A sneak peek into the model at a tech conference in Mumbai in February showed Hanooman  at work: a motorcycle mechanic in southern  queried an AI bot in his native Tamil, a banker conversed with the tool in Hindi, and a developer in Hyderabad used it to write computer code.Hanooman AI, besides many other similar in-house projects at Reliance, tells you how India's biggest conglomerate is quietly working on the new frontier of artificial intelligence (AI). Last year, in a meeting with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Ambani made a proposal to lay a 5G network across the state and make health services available across rural UP through artificial intelligence. He discussed the possibility of setting up a  Centre in each village to provide health services through AI.Today, at the 47th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of  Industries, Reliance Jio Chairman Akash Ambani introduced a new call recording service — JioPhonecall AI, which will let you use AI in every call. JioPhoneCall AI offers a suite of advanced features, including automatic call recording and transcription. Calls are stored securely in Jio Cloud and can be instantly converted from voice to text. For added convenience, the AI can also generate concise summaries of calls and translate them into various languages. “This allows anyone to easily capture and access important voice conversations, making them searchable, shareable, and understandable across languages—all with just a few clicks,” said Akash.Both Hanooman and JioPhoneCall AI show Ambani's ambition to create large AI models relevant for India, using Indian languages and socio-cultural contexts. For AI to achieve scale in India, it would need datasets of speech, text, images, and videos for training large language models in different languages. That's how AI can be democratised. Ambani, who has a penchant for scale, is working towards this goal.At its 1985 Annual General Meeting (AGM), Reliance Textiles Industries Ltd. changed its name to Reliance Industries Ltd., a sign of its maverick founder Dhirubhai Ambani's ambitions beyond the polyester textile business. He would go on to build oil-refining and petrochemicals businesses and turn Reliance Industries into India's biggest corporate house. His son, Mukesh Ambani, took the diversification further by launching the telecom business, Reliance Jio. That was Reliance's shift from oil to data.At the 47th AGM today, Ambani spoke of further diversification which is, in effect, a reinvention. While earlier he used to say data is the new oil, today he spoke of transforming Reliance into a deep-tech company: by embedding innovative technologies in every single business to maximise value; incubating several critical technological innovations in-house to enhance products and services; and building an AI-native digital infrastructure for all Reliance businesses. The company has already built its own software stack, integrating end-to-end workflows and real-time dashboards.Ambani explained how his company is building deep-tech  as an engine for business growth. ""Reliance spent over ₹3,643 crore ($437 million) in FY24 towards R&D, taking our spend on research to over ₹11,000 crore ($1.5 billion) in the last four years alone. We have more than 1,000 scientists and researchers working on critical research projects across all our businesses,"" he said.""I feel proud to inform you that last year Reliance filed over 2,555 patents, mainly in the areas of bio-energy innovations, solar and other green energy sources, and high-value chemicals. Digital is another principal area of our in-house research. We have filed patents in 6G, 5G, AI-Large Language Models, AI-Deep Learning, Big Data, Devices, Internet of Things, and Narrowband-IoT. I assure you that this ongoing tech-driven transformation of Reliance will propel the company into a new orbit of hyper-growth and multiply its value for years to come,"" Ambani added.Ambani announced Jio is developing a suite of tools and platforms, called Jio Brain, which spans the entire AI lifecycle. Jio Brain will enable the company to accelerate AI adoption across Jio, driving faster decisions, more accurate predictions, and a better understanding of customer needs. In time, Reliance can offer Jio Brain to other enterprises as well.Reliance's digital and telecom innovation happens under Jio Platforms Ltd (JPL) in which it holds a 67.03% stake. JPL collaborates with various entities as well as has its own team of scientists and experts to drive digital innovation. Two years ago, when Reliance was shaping its AI push, JPL had invested $15 million in US tech firm Two Platforms Inc.Two years ago, Jio had submitted to the telecom regulator that deployment of AI and big data technologies can improve the overall quality of telecom services, traffic, and spectrum management, while Bharti  and Vodafone Idea had said it was too early to even predict their use in telecom. Today, by announcing new AI-based services, Jio has taken the lead over its rivals.Reliance is already using AI tools to sharpen its products and services. Its new beauty and personal care brand, Tira, is leaning on AI tools that can suggest perfumes or cosmetics to woo customers in the burgeoning but competitive Indian beauty sector.Tira, which was launched in April last year, also uses electronic vending machines in its stores to dispense free samples of skincare products, according to Tejas Kapadia, head of marketing of the year-old startup that has 12 stores across India and a website. “Customers love that and they keep coming back for that,” Kapadia had told ET in an interview in May. The idea is to give customers a “plethora of experiences” using “some form of AI,” he added.One such interactive in-store experience is a “fragrance finder,” which generates perfume options after letting consumers smell a set of “cubes” with different notes of fragrances. Tira's “skin analyzer” infers the features of a customer by clicking a photo and recommends products that would suit them best. Its stores offer a free engraving service for buyers to personalize their purchases by etching names on perfume bottles or make-up boxes. The website also provides makeup and skincare lessons.In Video:

60,Cleaner cities: Here's the blueprint Indore offers for India,"Cities are key drivers of growth, and with ambitious targets, more than half of India's population is projected to live in urban areas. However, 42 Indian cities rank among the top 50 globally for the worst air pollution. Nearly half of our 603 rivers are polluted, and less than 20% of the generated waste is treated. Climate-related events are also putting increasing pressure on cities.A comprehensive roadmap is needed to 's 50 most polluted cities by 2030, alongside sector-specific action plans targeting residential combustion, industrial and power plant emissions, transport, and .Indore's transformation offers valuable lessons. In 2015, it lacked proper waste management infrastructure and had a century-old legacy landfill. Rivers and nullahs were contaminated by sewage from homes. Today,  stands as . Door-to-door waste collection and training of municipal workers were central to the strategy. Six types of waste were segregated from 5.85 lakh households, with specialised vehicles used for transportation. This waste was then transferred to six fully mechanised processing plants. Technology was leveraged to track vehicles, and a digitalised weighing system was implemented. A bio-CNG plant, set up in 2022, now produces 17,000 kg of CNG daily from wet waste.GIS was used to identify sewage outfalls in nullahs, and leakages were fixed. Over 200 km of nullahs were cleaned, improving discharge efficiency during the monsoon. Reuse of treated sewage, rainwater harvesting and other initiatives earned Indore the title of India's first Water Plus City. The city banned the burning of solid waste and imposed strict regulations on construction and demolition waste. Transitioning to clean cooking fuels and using cleaner industrial boilers were part of the plan. Indore is also gradually electrifying its public transport system. Indore sold advertising rights at community and public toilets, embedding circular economy principles. It became India's first urban local body to trade carbon credits and issued the country's first green bonds, raising ₹244 crore.Based on these learnings, a city-level Grand Challenge (GC) programme with clear timelines and targets is needed to clean our cities. GoI, along with bodies like CPCB, could run this programme by scaling up NCAP, aiming for at least a 35% reduction in PM2.5 levels by 2030. Cities should be evaluated on their performance in addressing pollution sources. can account for up to a third of PM2.5 levels, according to NCAP. Key indicators could include the shift to clean cooking, elimination of stubble burning, biomass power plant projects and a transition from firewood to electric heating. Traditional brick kilns are significant contributors to PM2.5 pollution and converting them to advanced tech should be a focus. Another priority is enforcing the 2015 emission standards for thermal power plants. Transitioning industrial boilers to electric alternatives will also be essential for reducing emissions. Phasing out old two-wheelers (over 12 years), mandating registration of electric three-wheelers, e-buses and electrifying airport transport are potential targets. A value chain for waste segregation, collection, recycling and reuse - following the Indore model - should be incentivised. Other action areas include prohibiting the burning of solid waste, phasing out single-use plastics, developing green belts and moving to a waste-to-wealth model. Installing air quality monitoring devices should be a priority. Responsibility for action lies with cities and municipal governments. A fund of ₹10,000 crore could be set aside for the next five years, with the top five performing cities receiving financial incentives.To effectively combat urban pollution, India must adopt the GC programme, drawing lessons from Indore's success. With clear targets and strong accountability, cities can reduce pollution and improve liveability. This mission requires collaboration between GoI, state governments and municipal bodies.Together, we can transform our cities into sustainable urban centres - making them not just engines of growth but models of environmental stewardship. The time to act is now, for the future of our cities and the well-being of our people.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

62,"Residential property sales highest in a decade: Not affordable housing, but this segment emerges as top favourite","With a remarkable surge in sales of , the real estate sector in India remained buoyant during the first half of 2024. With a total of 1.73 lakh units sold, housing sales in India reached an 11-year high in the January-June quarter, according to a report by Knight Frank. On yearly basis, residential housing sales increased 11%, signaling robust expansion across key metropolitan markets. recorded the highest sales volume nationwide with 47,259 units sold, marking a 16% year-on-year growth in H1 2024. With 9,130 units sold, Kolkata experienced the highest percentage growth in home sales at 25% year-on-year during the first half of 2024. Ahmedabad saw a 17% year-on-year increase as 9,377 units sold in the city during the January-June period. The surge in sales has been complemented by a surge in development activities, evident from the launch of 1,83,401 units in H1 2024. This figure marks a decade-high in half-yearly launches, indicating a proactive response to escalating market demand. Mumbai led in new launches with 46,985 units, followed by Kolkata, which saw a remarkable 60% growth in new launches, and Pune with a robust 32% increase.Commenting on the market dynamics, Gulam Zia, Senior Executive Director at Knight Frank India, highlighted the shift towards premium housing segments. ""The residential market's robust performance in H1 2024 saw sales exceed 1,73,000 units, a decade-high record. The premium category now commands 34% of the market, up from 15% in H1 2018,"" he noted. This shift is mirrored in both demand and supply, with a notable increase in launches of properties priced above Rs 1 crore.The report highlights a decline in sales for properties priced below Rs 50 lakh, which fell from 32% in H1 2023 (49,926 units) to 27% (46,178 units) in H1 2024. ""The combined impact of rising property prices, increased home loan rates, and the disproportionately adverse effects of the pandemic in this category continue to dampen demand. The current sales share of 27% starkly contrasts with the 54% observed in H1 2018,"" the report says. Mumbai, despite being the most expensive market, also led in affordable housing sales, witnessing an 11% year-on-year growth to 21,043 units.The mid-segment of India's real estate market, encompassing properties priced between Rs 50 lakh to Rs crore, saw a decline in market share from 38% in the first half of 2023 to 32% in H1 2024. According to the Knight Frank data, sales in this ticket-size category totaled 55,715 units during the first half of 2024. Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Pune emerged as the key contributors, collectively accounting for more than 60% of sales in this segment. Bengaluru led with 11,778 units sold, closely followed by Mumbai at 11,546 units, and Pune with 11,195 units. This shift, however, is seen as a natural adjustment within a broader upward trajectory, fueled by sustained interest from homebuyers despite the decrease in percentage.The higher end of the market, comprising residential units priced over Rs 1 crore and above, has witnessed significant growth. The luxury real estate market now commands a substantial 41% share of total sales across the eight major markets covered. This segment emerged as the primary driver of overall sales growth in H1 2024, experiencing a 51% year-on-year increase. Sales in this category surged to 71,349 units in H1 2024 from 47,130 units in the same period last year.The National Capital Region (NCR) emerged as the leader in premium segment sales, recording 20,795 unit sales in H1 2024. This was followed closely by Mumbai with 14,699 units sold, and Bengaluru with 13,698 units.The data underscores a clear trend towards higher-value properties, driven by evolving consumer preferences and a robust demand for premium living spaces. Despite the increase in sales in the premium segment, concerns about affordability persist in the mid-segment category, where adjustments are underway to align with market dynamics and consumer expectations.Despite the surge in sales, the report notes a 3% year-on-year increase in unsold inventory levels, particularly in the premium segment, which saw a 27% rise. However, metrics like the Quarters to Sell (QTS) indicate improving market health, with the overall QTS falling to 5.9 quarters in H1 2024 from 9.5 quarters in H1 2021. The premium segment's QTS level stood at a healthy 5.1 quarters, suggesting manageable inventory despite the increase.Looking ahead, experts anticipate sustained market momentum supported by stable economic conditions and continued growth in premium housing preferences. The focus remains on addressing challenges in the lower price categories to ensure more inclusive market growth.Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, of Knight Frank India, said, ""Based on our expectation of continued stability in the socio-economic and political conditions and the current trajectory of growth, we anticipate a strong finish to the year 2024 with both residential and commercial office transactions noting record highs.”"

Their argument: ESAs can't be off-limits for industries, mining, tourism and other commercial activities because of economic and developmental needs. This is propagating a reckless, false binary. Given the multiple disasters, states must finalise a comprehensive  plan for their own good. The risk and cost of inaction will only escalate.The 'environment vs development' dichotomy persists.

This is no mean achievement and once parity becomes the norm, women will gain access to more leadership roles in sport, which becomes a virtuous cycle. From the organisers' part, more women's events have been scheduled in prime TV slots, such as the closing day. TV viewership for women's sporting events is booming, and economics and affirmative action are less incompatible. It is easier to achieve gender equality in an event like the  because there is no prize money involved. But in sports where men earn significantly more, the economics turns awry.But things are changing there as well. Spectators make sports rich, and TV viewership among men for sport has plateaued while it is growing among women. This has a snowball effect, particularly on women taking up sport as a career. Increased managerial roles holds the second biggest demonstration effect beyond the active life of a sportswoman. Governments need to intervene where markets are not moving fast enough. Ultimately, however, the markets will have to support equal pay and longer tenure for women in sport. This requires the same proactive HR policies as in other walks of life to help women balance their professional and family responsibilities. Work life extension beyond competitive sport is key to reducing the lifetime pay gap.Nations hitting sport gender equality leverage common infrastructure and ecosystem for both sexes. Where needed, men's sport can subsidise women's participation, but it must have a sunset date. The aim would be to allow men's and women's events to compete equally for advertising revenue. The Olympics, by its nature, encourage operational parity. This should filter into the leadership of other sporting events. Pay and visibility are the best approaches to reducing women's exit from sport at the competitive and coaching stages."
70,"ET Exclusive: India must back businesses more to grow faster at 10%, says Prem Watsa, CEO Fairfax Financial Holdings","Billionaire  said India would be able to achieve the double-digit growth that it needs to transform itself into a developed nation with much of the groundwork having been done. “Ten per cent economic growth gets India ahead... (South) Korea did it for three decades, Japan, China also did it. There are a lot of smart people here, so no reason why they won’t do it,” said Hyderabad-born Watsa, chief executive officer of the $97-billion , headquartered in Toronto. Watsa spoke to ET on a recent visit to India during which he also met PM .The prime minister has pledged to turn India into a developed country by 2047, the 100th year of Independence. Watsa said India has to prioritise  even more to achieve the goal of higher growth. “You need regulation but more to help businesses,” he said. “Who provides all the jobs? Businesses! There used to be socialism but all that is now gone and it should never come back but businesses you have to encourage.” A long-standing admirer of the PM, his enthusiasm hasn’t waned. “Mr Modi is fantastic and will make it even more easier to do business,” he said. The IIT-Madras alumnus started Fairfax in the 1980s after migrating to Canada. He has an investment portfolio of $7 billion in India and has committed to double that. Fairfax owns multiple insurance businesses in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and West Asia. It is among the largest investors in property and casualty insurance companies in the world. In India, Fairfax owns controlling stakes in , , ,  and . among others. “We are backing people who have a track record, good people who are honest and can build a good company going forward… that’s what Fairfax did. I started in 1985. I wanted to build a good company... a little bit of luck and it’s worked out to be pretty good,” he said, when asked to describe how he picks investment opportunities. Watsa declined to comment on the worsening ties between Canada and India.He said Fairfax was not for sale and that it would still be around “hundred years from now,” pointing to the appreciation in its value. “Today our stock is at C$1,720. It was C$3¼ when we began in 1985, so we’ve compounded at 18.9% for 38 years,” he said, encapsulating the Fairfax track record that has earned him the moniker of ‘Canada’s Warren Buffet’. “It’s always about building for the long term and I’m not going to sell it (Fairfax),” said Watsa. “It will always be professionally run. My kids will be on the board in terms of making sure our culture is maintained but my kids have their own businesses.”He championed free enterprise, saying it was the hallmark of America’s growth and wants it to spread wider in India.“Lee Kuan Yew (Singapore’s former PM) was asked 15 years ago: Has America peaked? He said, absolutely not, and for two reasons. It is the most entrepreneurial country in the world and anyone can become an American. Satya Nadella, an immigrant in America, is running one of the biggest companies in the world — Microsoft,” Watsa said.He made a pitch for privatisation, saying that state-run companies are “vestiges of the past,” urging the Indian government to push asset sales.Fairfax is a potential suitor for IDBI Bank that is to be privatised. Fairfax India already owns an Indian lender — CSB (formerly Catholic Syrian Bank).He declined to comment when asked about Fairfax’s interest in IDBI Bank.Watsa said the government can spend the proceeds of disinvestment on education, health and nutrition.He called on India to focus on more tax-free zones to encourage business activity, similar to the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City).Apart from tax waivers, these zones should be subject to international law and have no labour regulations, similar to such sites elsewhere.“I like tax-free zones with international law. Then you don’t get caught up in all the domestic stuff, you know, changing Indian rules and labour regulations is very difficult. So, you earmark an area and this area is like free. It happened in China when Pudong was nothing. You see Pudong today, it will blow your mind,” said Watsa."

72,Home loan interest advantage in new tax regime: You can reduce your income tax by claiming loss but only on this type of house property,"If you have an ongoing home loan and are looking to reduce your net  outgo, it is advisable to claim a loss from house property. By doing so, you can offset this loss against your other incomes, potentially lowering your overall taxable income and reducing your total tax burden. It is important to meet specific conditions if you wish to carry forward or offset your house property's loss against other incomes. Keep reading to learn more about these conditions.There is no limit for set-off for  with incomes that you get from other house property, however there is a limit of Rs 2 lakh when you set-off house property loss with other incomes (different heads of income). Moreover, if the house property loss exceeds Rs 2 lakh in a year then the excess loss can be carried forward for 8 years if you chose to file your income tax return () under the old tax regime. However, under the  (section 115 BAC), you can't set off self-occupied house property loss against any other income or carry forward any losses.""As per section 115 BAC, set-off of current year house property loss shall not be available against any other head of income under the new tax regime. Also, any remaining loss under this head cannot be carried forward. Also, it may be noted that in respect of self-occupied property, deduction of interest paid against home loan is not permissible,"" said the Income Tax Department.Under the new tax regime, individuals can still claim a deduction on home loan interest payments for let-out properties. Kunal Savani, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, explains that while taxpayers choosing the new tax regime cannot offset or carry forward losses from self-occupied properties, there are no such restrictions for let-out properties. ""Taxpayers should be able to set-off carried forward house property losses if they pertain to let-out properties, even under the new-regime,"" says Savani.Abbas Jaorawala, Senior Director and Head - , Khaitan Legal Associate explains the concept with an example: ""Mr. A has incurred a home loan interest expense of Rs 2 lakh on a self-occupied house property. He has also incurred a home loan interest expense of Rs 5 lakh on a let-out house property (rented out), from which taxable rent (after other permissible deductions) is Rs 8 lakh per annum.Under the old tax regime, Mr. A would have paid tax only on net-rental income of Rs 1 lakh i.e. against total income of Rs 8 lakh from house properties, total deductions for interest would have been entire Rs 7 lakh paid -- Rs 2 lakh (self-occupied) + Rs 5 lakh (let-out).In the new tax regime, the interest of Rs 2 lakh (self-occupied) will be ignored, irrespective of the amount of taxable rent from let-out properties.Mr. A will continue to claim deduction of Rs 5 lakh on let-out house property and pay tax on balance rent of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 8 lakh less Rs 5 lakh). If the taxable rent from let-out property was say Rs 3 lakh, then Mr. A would claim interest deduction of only Rs 3 lakh and the balance interest expense on let-out house property of Rs 2 lakh (Rs 5 lakh less Rs 3 lakh) would lapse and not be allowed to be carried forward.""Ankit Jain, Partner, Ved Jain & Associates, says that if you have any carried forward losses related to a self-occupied house property, you will lose them all if you choose the new tax regime. Therefore, Jain suggests calculating the tax amount under both regimes before making a decision.Jain explains: ""If a taxpayer has transitioned from the old regime to the new regime and has brought forward losses under the head 'Income from House Property' from the old regime, the eligibility of setoff will be determined on the basis of the nature of the loss:""The home loan interest deduction that was previously allowed under the old regime for let-out properties (which could create a loss if the interest exceeded the rental income) is not permitted in the new tax regime. Additionally, any house property loss carried forward from previous years (under the old regime) cannot be carried forward or set off in future years if the taxpayer opts for the new regime,"" says Jain.( Originally published on Oct 24, 2024 )"

75,The state of inequality in India,"There are different kinds of inequalities in India that are multidimensional and intersectional in nature. While multidimensional poverty has been an area of study in the field of developmental economics since the early 2000s, multidimensional  is a fairly new perspective. Such an approach focuses on the interrelationship between different variables like income, labour, education, health and household conditions in order to emphasise on the degree of deprivation. The interrelationship is such that lack of one kind leads to the household becoming deprived in other areas as well. This deprivation has both social and economic roots that reinforce oppressive structures that limit an individual’s (and by extension, the whole society) capabilities and liberties. Economic factors like loss of job, informalisation of work that takes away worker benefits, low incomes and having no assets or wealth transcend into the social lives by restricting their mobility and trapping the households in a vicious circle of dearth and inequities.It is challenging to arrive at a singular definition of a deprived household or vulnerability, but we can assume that a household devoid of essential means of survival or not having the purchasing capacity to access life-saving or life-nurturing services can be called a deprived household. More important, the idea of multidimensional inequality, beyond a methodological intervention, proposes structural solutions to inequality. These solutions range from the inclusion of deprived households in the labour market so that the sources and opportunities of growth do not evade them to enhancing social security.Economic variables like income and labour and socio-economic variables like health, education, and household conditions are highlighted as together these variables enhance the standard of living. It is observed that the correlation between income, health and education is such that lower incomes or loss of income leads to inaccessibility and unaffordability of services in the sectors of health and education. In India, the Periodic Labour Force Survey for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 shows that the Top 10% earn approximately equal to the bottom 64%. The top 10 account for one-third of the incomes earned.While income disparity is not the only trigger to descent into poverty, it boldly outlines the everyday experiences of inequality and inequities. Basic needs become luxuries, spilling over in the form of resources becoming inaccessible. The income profiles have highlighted a vast pay gap between men and women, calling attention to gender-based inequities in the labour market that further marginalise women and reduce their labour force participation rate. Even though it is difficult to trace the movement from one income class to another due to the absence of class definitions, the share held by the Top 1% is only increasing, thereby further marginalising the poor. In this context, low incomes need to be viewed in the context of multi-dimensional deprivations. Similarly, the positive changes in the labour market, like the expansion of the working-age population, have created a massive potential for exploiting the demographic dividend to increase the country’s economic productivity.However, this potential rests on critical interventions like creating new jobs, integrating the informal sector with the formal sector, and empowering the female labour force to increase their participation rate. The latter also rests on the shift in the mindset of the society to view women as the secondary “bread-earners”.Affordability and accessibility of health and education sectors are also a prime concern under a multidimensional ambit, where the emphasis is on enabling structural changes in the nature of inequality. Data from several government sources like the 4th and 5th round of NFHS as well as UDISE+ has revealed that India has performed well over several indicators like improved sanitation facilities, electrification of households and clean fuel for cooking. These developments can be credited to various social protection schemes and initiatives – most notable of which remains JAM  – Jan Dhan Aadhar and Mobile – that focuses on deeper technological integration in the society. This also increases the penetration of social sector schemes as the availing of the schemes becomes more efficient for beneficiaries.As an approach toward ensuring welfare for the most vulnerable population and as a corrective measure to social and economic inequities present in society, social protection schemes act as a mechanism to increase the resilience of marginalised people to socio-economic shocks. In a world where any volatile situation can push a massive section of the society into poverty, social protection schemes should be emphasised.India’s robust and multidimensional social protection system has been an inspiration to the world at large. These schemes are rooted in welfarism that focuses on making essential services affordable skill enhancement, opportunity creation, and sustainable living, ensuring a universal increase in the standard of living. The emphasis on the interaction between social and economic aspects of inequality helps us holistically drive policy action through social protection frameworks. It raises pertinent issues related to ease of living, and sectoral outcomes.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Here's a detailed guide to what you need to know before planning your trip to Bhutan.Although a visa isn't necessary, Indian visitors must obtain an ‘Entry Permit’ upon arrival. This permit is issued by the Department of Immigration at the Pedestrian Terminal in Phuentsholing. To secure entry, travelers need specific documents:Indian tourists have the choice to either plan their own trip or use a local tour operator's services to arrange travel documents and itineraries. A list of certified operators is available on the Bhutan Travel and Department of Tourism websites.Independent travelers should:Bhutan charges an SDF of INR 1,200 per person per night for Indian visitors. This fee is aimed at promoting sustainable tourism and funding environmental conservation efforts. Here's how it applies:Indian-registered vehicles are permitted in designated zones within Bhutan at no additional cost. However, if you plan to drive beyond the Rinchending Check Post in Phuentsholing, you’ll face additional expenses:The Pedestrian Terminal at Phuentsholing, at the Jaigaon-Phuentsholing border, operates round the clock. Indian visitors staying within Phuentsholing for less than 24 hours do not need an entry permit. However, pre-registration via the BMS website is recommended, generating a QR code for entry. For those planning to travel beyond Rinchending, the SDF applies, and a permit from the Regional Immigration Office is necessary.Indian visitors can also enter Bhutan through Samtse, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Sarpang/Gelephu. Entry conditions for both individuals and vehicles are identical to those at Phuentsholing, ensuring consistent requirements across the southern Indo-Bhutan border.Though Bhutan’s visa-free access for Indians remains an advantage, the SDF could mean additional costs that travelers should account for when budgeting their trip. Proper planning and awareness of the fees and requirements will ensure a smooth and enjoyable visit to the Kingdom of Bhutan."

78,View: How Coronavirus accentuates inequality,"Inequality is a phenomenon that always permeates all levels of society across all walks of life. But its effects are exacerbated in times of crisis just like the one that is currently underway. The  has spread across every continent infecting millions in its wake, which seems to be an equalising trend at first glance. In fact, the Global South seems to be relatively less affected than its richer counterparts as is evident in the African experience until now. But in any country around the world, the poor are the most vulnerable to the pandemic and its aftereffects. Out of all countries, India remains in a particularly precarious position being one of the most unequal countries in the world with a significant burden of poverty as well.It is the poorest sections of society which will find it most challenging to access healthcare, more so in India where out-of-pocket expenditure forms a bulk of medical expenses. Poor neighbourhoods are also more densely packed, which increases the likelihood of the spread of the virus. Their households are also typically constrained in terms of access of basic services like continuous water supply, which makes hygiene a luxury. But apart from such healthcare concerns of the pandemic itself, it is becoming evident that its unequal repercussions extend across every aspect of livelihood that is crucial for development and will set back our fight against poverty and inequality by decades.The access to education, for instance, is becoming more challenging for children from poorer households. For a majority of Indians, digital learning is still not a viable option. Even though the mobile phone and internet penetration has been quite rapid and high over the last few years, the digital divide is still quite significant. As per the 75th round of National Sample Survey (NSS) from 2017-18, merely 24 per cent of Indian households have an internet connection. There is a stark urban-rural divide in this spread. While a little over 15 per cent of Indian households have access to internet, the corresponding figure for urban households is 42 per cent.Then there is the question of access to digital devices like smartphones and computers and also a reliable electricity connection to operate them. The same NSS report shows that only 24 per cent Indians own a smartphone and 11 per cent households own a computer. Moreover, merely 8 per cent households with members aged between five and twenty-four years possess a computer along with an internet connection. Finally, a survey by the Ministry of Rural Development showed that less than half of Indian households received more than 12 hours of electricity in a day, which implies that even those households that have access to digital devices might face operational challenges. Thus, only a miniscule proportion of the Indian population can imagine providing education for their children through digital means at a time when traditional mechanisms have broken down.As a result of the unequal nature of the impact of the , its effects will reverberate across generations. The children from poor households that will lose out on vital access to education as long as the pandemic continues will hardly see an improvement in their conditions after that. These children will witness their households slide further into poverty over the coming year. The ILO estimates that more than 400 million people in India stare at such a future as they rely on informal work. In such a scenario, these children are more likely to be forced out of school and into the job market to sustain their households. So, the gaps between the haves and have nots in India will further widen and crystallise over the years to come.These trends will also become visible between countries around the world. As per UNDP estimates, around 86 per cent of children attending primary schools in low human development countries are currently not receiving an education. The same figure for countries that are high on the human development stands at 20 per cent. The effective out-of-school rates are estimated to regress to levels seen in the 1980s. The world is, thus, faced with the prospect of losing indispensable developmental progress that it has achieved over the last few decades. The levels of poverty and inequality within and across countries are bound to exacerbate.When faced with such a prospect, the only difference a country can make is by providing sufficient social protection and safety nets to prevent the regressive movement of people below the poverty line. Access to basic services can also be expanded through innovative means. Several states like Kerala and Bengal have moved their virtual classes to television sets, which has a wider penetration that internet even in rural areas. Even Doordarshan and All India Radio are broadcasting various teaching courses. This could be extended on a larger scale for central boards of education as well. The country needs to work towards reducing the vast inequality in education access to prevent accentuating its societal inequality in the future.( Originally published on Jun 10, 2020 )(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

83,Supercharging one key market is crucial to India’s $5 trillion goals,"India, already the world’s fastest-growing major economy, is pushing for even more dramatic expansion to become a developed nation, a goal that hinges on expanding access to capital.Nothing illustrates that challenge better than the 47 trillion rupee ($559 billion) . It’s one of the world’s smallest as a percentage of gross domestic product, at just 16%, even after record growth. Bankers in Mumbai say doubling that ratio would better help finance ambitious goals, like becoming a $5 trillion economy in the next three years.One of the major impediments is a longstanding rule from authorities that makes it hard for long-term investors like insurers and pension funds to go big on infrastructure. The regulation bars them from investing in notes rated below AA, which in India are deemed risky because they’re hard to offload in a smaller market during times of stress.Spending on roads, ports and bridges, as well as on all kinds of capital expenditure, is set to reach about 110 trillion rupees ($1.3 trillion) between 2023 and 2027, an increase of 70% from the previous five years, according to the National Stock Exchange of India. The company notes market will likely cover just one-sixth of that amount, it said. That’s due in part to those restrictions, given many infrastructure borrowings carry lower or no ratings. “The corporate bond market is not deep enough to support the country’s infrastructure finance requirement,” said R Shankar Raman, director and chief financial officer at Larsen & Toubro Ltd., India’s top engineering company. For these reasons, the firm has tended to rely mainly on its own cash and bank loans for funding, and has only tapped the bond market once in the past four years.Government financing of course plays a major role in the infrastructure projects dotting Indian cities. But as the economy gets even bigger, the need for both the local credit market and overseas lenders to offer alternative funding sources will become more acute. The subways, airports, sanitation and electricity grids underpinning urbanization in the world’s most populous nation take years to build. Such time horizons attract investors like insurers who need cash flows that match their longer-term payouts. But in India the regulatory hurdles have disrupted this dynamic.Insurers are also subject to a cap on their exposure to infrastructure assets. For instance, they cannot invest more than 20% of the cost of the project.“The rules clearly deserve a relook,” said Somasekhar Vemuri, senior director regulatory, affairs and operations at Crisil Ratings Ltd., a local unit of S&P Global Ratings. “There can be guidelines based on the investor’s risk capital to avoid concentration risk rather than linking the exposure limit to the issuer’s capital base.”A spokesperson for the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, the industry watchdog, said that the authority will continue to review investment measures and look at any innovative debt instruments that would enable infrastructure funding.A representative at the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.    There has been some progress. That follows steps spanning recent years up to just the past few days— measures that stand to strengthen the bond market and wean companies off bank borrowings. Those include: At the same time, companies helping to fuel India’s expansion also have other debt financing options. Some prefer local loans. The amount of such lending to industries and services stands at about 28% of GDP.What would be one of the largest local-currency deals in India this year highlights the reliance on loans for key infrastructure. State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp. is in talks with lenders to raise about 320 billion rupees for building a refinery. A unit of Indian Oil Corp. is also targeting a 280 billion rupee facility for a similar project.Loans are often more practical to finance projects than bonds as the money can be drawn in phases, unlike bonds where the funds would sit idle until needed, according to Vetsa Ramakrishna Gupta, director finance at BPCL. Yet, expanding the bond market remains crucial, as it allows lenders to spread out credit risks. Also, the yields are more sensitive to shifts in policy rates, meaning any central bank rate cut would filter down more quickly.There are signs of greenshoots as some new lenders that finance infrastructure tap the bond market steadily, said Sujata Guhathakurta, president and head of debt capital markets at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.“If the investment rules are relaxed a bit, then investor appetite will improve resulting in the bond market to deepen and grow further,” she said."

86,"View: Recalculate inequality — it hasn’t worsened over time, it’s stayed the same","The world grew fast after 1991 when countries moved toward  and . But critics say  has soared. Thomas , using income-tax data rather than survey data, concluded that the share of the top 1% in all US  soared from 9% to 19% between 1962 and 2019.This dismal estimate has been exposed as a statistical bloomer in a peer-reviewed September 2023 paper (shorturl.at/cyEMU) by Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They show that, calculated correctly, US income inequality has been unchanged since 1960. This contradicts the narrative of inequality widely taken to be gospel truth.What about India? Lucas Chancel and Piketty wrote a paper in 2017, estimating Indian inequality from 1922 to 2015 based on  data and other sources. I attacked Piketty in a series of newspaper columns, followed by a November 2017 Cato Institute paper, 'Piketty's Botched Analysis of Inequality in ' (shorturl.at/fzDM9). Many of my criticisms of Piketty's methodology have been repeated by Auten and Splinter, to considerable acclaim.Taxpayers respond to incentives. In the US, Ronald Reagan slashed taxes after coming to power in 1980. Earlier,  individuals sought complex tax shelters to reduce their tax liability. But once I-T rates were slashed, many taxpayers abandoned the tax shelters and reported more income.Before Reagan, tax rates were much higher on individual income than corporate income. So, companies retained most of their earnings in their reserves, and did not distribute them as dividends (on which the rich would pay heavy taxes). This reduced the apparent income of the richest people. But after Reagan slashed tax rates, it became attractive for companies to declare high dividends. Much of the post-Reagan surge in reported incomes of the rich merely represented reduced use of tax shelters and increased dividends.Piketty and Chancel analysed different periods of taxation in India, and concluded that inequality dropped sharply from 1950 to the early 1980s under Nehru-Indira's socialism, but then rose sharply in the era of economic liberalisation. Was the Nehru-Indira era good for the poor? No. The  ratio remained unchanged from 1947 to 1980.Since the population almost doubled, the absolute number of poor almost doubled, a terrible outcome. By contrast, poverty plummeted after liberalisation. Around 415 million people were lifted out of poverty between 2005 and 2021 according to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index, even as inequality supposedly increased.But did it really increase? Tax rates rose after Independence. Indira Gandhi raised the top rate to 97.75%. Businesspeople kept their earnings in tax shelters (such as tax-exempt trusts), or as plain black money, to survive. Companies avoided declaring high dividends, as in the US. The apparent fall in inequality was largely a mirage - the rich mostly found ways to cloak their income.Later, the top tax rate was cut to 50% in 1985, 40% by Manmohan Singh, and to 30% by P Chidambaram in his 1997 budget. Naturally, the rich came out of tax shelters, reduced resort to black money, and declared higher dividends in response to much lower tax rates, just as Auten and Splinter showed it to happen in the US. This appeared to create a surge in the incomes of the Indian rich and, hence, inequality. The mirage of greater equality in the 1970s was buttressed by the mirage of growing inequality thereafter.A sociological issue raised by Auten and Splinter is that the US marriage rate after the 1960s slumped among poor people, especially Blacks. It fell much less among the rich. So, incomes of the poorer half were split among a much larger number of households than of the rich. This created the illusion of a greater income share for the rich. This notion has been exposed as false by Auten and Splinter after making appropriate adjustments.In India, Piketty used I-T data for the rich, but for the poor, he used a mix of survey data from National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and Indian Human Development Surveys (IHDSs). This exaggerated the income share of the rich. India levies I-T on individuals, so the top taxpayers are mainly the richest males. But NSSO surveys and IHDSs estimate the income/consumption of entire households and divide that by the number of persons per household, to produce a per-capita estimate. This reduces the income share of each poor person. Yet, Piketty makes no adjustment for this.Piketty and his collaborators typically make inequality estimates without adjusting for taxes paid by the rich and welfare benefits going to the poor. This seriously exaggerates inequality. Auten and Splinter have adjusted for both these factors, plus other technical adjustments. These adjustments make the difference between black and white.Their new calculations show that the pre-tax share of the rich increased by only 2.6 percentage points between 1960 and 2019, not remotely close to the 19% claimed by Piketty. Adjusting for tax payments and transfers to the poor, the income of the top 1% was the same in the early 1960s as it is today - inequality has not increased at all.In India, too, Piketty's estimates should not be taken seriously. Estimates of some Indian economists suggest that inequality has not worsened here either. Shed no tears.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

87,Housing price of new projects jumps over 145% in two Delhi-NCR areas in 5 years; check property price rise in your city,"The Indian real estate market has seen a significant surge in prices, with average prices for new launches in top 10 cities increasing by 88% in the last five years. This trend was highlighted in a recent report by PropEquity, a real estate data analytics firm.The report highlights that Gurugram experienced the most significant increase in newly-launched housing prices, jumping from Rs 7,500 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 19,500 per square foot in 2024. It marks an increase of 160% in five years.Noida experienced a price jump from Rs 6,500 in 2019 to Rs 16,000 in 2024, reflecting a rise of 146% in five years. Bengaluru prices rose from Rs 5,051 in 2019 to Rs 10,020 in 2024, a notable increase of 98% in five years. In Hyderabad, the price jumped from Rs 4,686 in 2019 to Rs 8,500 in 2024, representing an 81% rise in five years. Chennai recorded a surge from Rs 4,451 in 2019 to Rs 8,023 in 2024, indicating an 80% rise during the five-year period.In contrast, Mumbai witnessed a more modest jump of 37%, with prices moving from Rs 25,820 per square foot to Rs 35,500 per square foot during the period under review. Between 2019 and 2024, approximately 15,000 projects, including apartments, floors, and villas, were launched in these top 10 cities, which include Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Noida, and Gurugram.Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO of PropEquity, commented on the findings: “Real estate prices have gone up exponentially across all major cities in the last five years. Factors such as massive infrastructure development, increased interest from non-resident Indians (NRIs), high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNIs), stock market gains leading to wealth creation, rising homeownership sentiments, and a shift towards luxury and super-luxury homes have all contributed to this steep rise.”The PropEquity report provides a breakdown of the average housing prices for new launch projects across these cities:In terms of per-square-foot prices, Mumbai remains the most expensive city, with an average price of Rs 35,500 per square foot in 2024. Gurugram follows at Rs 19,500 per square foot, and Noida at Rs 16,000 per square foot in 2024. Notably, in 2019, only Mumbai had an average price of new launch projects exceeding Rs 10,000 per square foot. By 2024, all but three cities — Hyderabad, Chennai, and Kolkata—have seen average launch prices exceed this threshold.This significant rise in real estate prices reflects broader economic trends, including a recovery from the pandemic, increased urbanisation, and a growing middle class seeking homeownership. As buyers navigate this changing landscape, the demand for new launches continues to rise, indicating a strong outlook for the real estate sector in India.The implications of these trends are far-reaching, affecting not only potential homeowners but also investors looking to capitalize on the booming market.

Secondary caregivers include partners, spouses or other family members supporting the primary caregiver and the policy covers biological parents, adoptive parents and those involved in surrogacy.“It’s an evolution of the thinking that has been in the company for a while,” said Balaji Sreenivasan, executive vice-president, human resources,  India. “We, as an employer, have a role in making equal parenting a reality in this country.”A large number of women in Corporate India drop out of the workforce after , and  leave can level the playing field for working mothers.“In Scandinavian countries, there is high women’s employment, and equal parenting plays a big role in this,” said Sreenivasan.In March, in a first-of its kind initiative,  rolled out a foster/kinship caregiver leave policy, offering up to four weeks of leave to employees who opt for pre-adoption foster care or become legal guardians as per their familial requirements. The company also enhanced its secondary caregiver leave and expanded its daycare tie-ups.“We are deeply committed to fostering an  for people from all backgrounds and acknowledge the changing societal structures. Our approach is guided by active listening and proactively anticipating evolving needs,” said Anuradha Razdan, executive director, human resources, Hindustan Unilever.“In fact, all our parental policies – be it birth, adoptive or surrogate – are gender-neutral, and same-sex partners are included wherever applicable. These initiatives reflect our dedication to providing essential support, enabling our employees to thrive both professionally and personally,” she said. In July last year,  introduced a gender-neutral  programme, which allows 26 weeks of leave for primary caregivers (who will also be entitled to another 26 weeks of unpaid extended leave or flexible working), and a month of leave for secondary caregivers, available in tranches up to a year later. In September,  announced an enhanced 20-week paternity and adoption leave, irrespective of gender, relationship status or how a child comes to permanently join an employee’s family.“An inclusive and enabling work environment is an important pillar of our talent proposition. It helps us attract the right talent irrespective of their individual characteristics and retain them through their various life stages,” said Shivshanker SV, India and South Asia head, human resources, Standard Chartered Bank.Such initiatives contribute at various levels, according to experts.Introducing more liberal parental leaves can have positive economic benefits for organisations through reduction in turnover costs and increasing workforce participation rates, particularly for women, said Mansee Singhal, rewards consulting leader, Mercer India. “It can also contribute to reducing gender pay gaps by allowing women to maintain their career progression and return to work after having a child. Good parental leave policies also help recognising organisations as good places to work, thereby impacting attrition and retention of workforce,” she said.“We believe these initiatives also address globally prevalent societal norms around traditional roles, improve workforce participation and provide options to those who want to take up shared caring responsibilities,” said Standard Chartered Bank’s Shivshanker."

91,"Stabilising prices, securing steady supply should be a priority to sustain the millet revolution: Founder of Millet Bank"," has increased in the country on account of several  but the growth hasn't met expectations, says Vishala Reddy Vuyyala, Founder, Millet Bank and Minkan Agro Industries Private Limited.In an interaction with ET Digital, Reddy talks about why farmers are hesitant to grow  and the need for more incentives and support until demand stabilises. A  is essential, focusing on providing farmers with better profits, he says. Edited excerpts: Millet production has been on the rise thanks to initiatives like the National Millet Mission and the International Year of Millets 2023. Despite this progress, growth hasn't met expectations. The Indian government aims to improve soil health, tackle micronutrient deficiencies, and support small farmers through the millet promotion. However, achieving these goals requires a significant rise in millet cultivation and widespread adoption. To sustain this momentum, a comprehensive approach is needed. Given the past neglect, a focused effort over the next decade is essential to meet the desired goals.Millet prices fluctuate a lot because demand exceeds supply. Farmers are not willing to grow millets due to inconsistent demand and low margins. Startups using millets are also struggling. To solve this, we need to improve millet farming by using a cluster-based approach, offering financial incentives, providing quality seeds and promoting climate-resilient practices. We also need to strengthen the , establish direct links between farmers and startups, and ensure supportive government policies. Stabilising millet prices and securing a steady supply should be taken on a priority to sustain the momentum. Not all farmers are reaping the full benefits of these increases. Several factors influence this outcome. Many millet farmers — often from underdeveloped regions like hilly areas, drylands and forests — face challenges in benefiting from the rising demand and prices. These farmers, including smallholders, women and tribal communities, typically lack direct market access and rely on middlemen, who take a large share of the profits. This situation, coupled with fluctuating prices and inconsistent demand, makes it hard for them to secure fair and stable prices. Moreover, limited access to quality inputs, poor storage facilities, and weak market linkages further diminish their gains. We need to improve market access, establish fair pricing mechanisms, and support local value addition at the village level.  Farmers are hesitant to grow millets due to demand-supply fluctuations and need more incentives and support until demand stabilises. To increase production, we need to address grassroots issues while focusing on promoting millets at a high level. A cluster-based approach is essential, focusing on providing farmers with better profits through value addition and integrated infrastructure at the village or farm level. Current schemes such as a common facility centres mainly handle processing but overlook critical aspects like inputs, production challenges, and market linkages. Market access should extend beyond traditional expos to more dynamic platforms. Support for branding, packaging, and marketing is needed, along with mass awareness campaigns in regional languages about existing schemes.The government is investing in R&D to develop high-yielding, drought-resistant millet varieties and has designated the Indian Institute of Millets Research as a global centre of excellence. In addition to R&D, other ecosystem challenges need to be solved to increase production.  Yes, state governments should be more proactive in distributing millets through the PDS to help address market linkage issues and meet the nutritional needs of poorer and lower-middle-class populations. States like Odisha and Karnataka have initiated such schemes, and others should follow suit. Integrating millets into the PDS can promote their cultivation, diversify the food basket and reduce reliance on water-intensive crops. This approach would not only enhance nutritional outcomes but also support sustainable agriculture suited to India's changing climate.As agriculture is a state responsibility, state governments must take the lead in this effort. Several states lack specific millet policies and have not launched their state millet missions. It should be taken up on priority. The Decode Millet initiative is a campaign designed to educate consumers. Conceptualised by Millet Bank in collaboration with Nutrihub/IIMR, the Department of IT & Industries in Telangana, Corteva Agri Science, United Way, and various volunteers and nutritionists, the campaign targets one million corporate employees across eight cities. It includes free activities like expert talks, pop-up stalls and millet recipe demonstrations. For Nutrition Week from September 1-7, we are partnering with the Being Farmer Foundation and conducting awareness in 7 large communities in Hyderabad. The campaign also highlights the environmental benefits of millet cultivation, such as low water use and climate resilience, promoting them as a sustainable food choice. By educating consumers, Decode Millet aims to increase demand for millets, support farmers, and contribute to a healthier, more sustainable food system."

96,'R&D innovation helping India play key role in shaping global trends',"India’s rise as a global hub for  innovation is being propelled by advancements in research and development (R&D), with the country playing a central role in shaping global trends, said Bernard Charles, executive chairman of the board of directors of .In an interview to ET, he said the French company, which clocks annual revenue of about $8 billion, is looking at technologies like  to allow researchers to simulate human biology, develop  and explore new ways to treat diseases with greater precision.“For the first time ever, in the world of industry, what is contained with the virtual twin has surpassed the capacity of any knowledgeable teams to observe the reality to replicate,” he said. “This happened in the last 20 years and it’s now visible across all industries. We are applying those techniques to new therapeutics (and) new medical practices.”He said the company is seeing some meaningful progress but it would take time to deploy it across the world. For example, at , one of the most advanced hospitals for heart surgery of newly birthed babies, a day before the surgeon team goes to the block, they run simulations using Dassault Systemes’ platform.“They validate everything, look at the flow, look at where they cut, where they reassemble the malformation – they do all of this,” Charles said. “The result today is (that) they achieved a 98% alignment between what our simulation recommended and what they actually are going to do in the surgery room. In some way, while we are in a good position in many of those sectors, we are at the beginning.”He called it the beginning of “a new wide range of possibilities” and the coming of age of the 21st century industry - be it in mobility, space, air, sea or life sciences.In India, he emphasised, the company has many customers using its 3D experience platform to create the virtual twin of the cars or infrastructure or energy centre – doing the engineering and the production on the life cycle of those complex products.“We have three types of activities in India - customer engagement, R&D and then creating content,” Charles said. “We have a very large research and development lab that is really contributing to developing our solution on a global basis where we have a global R&D machine with 68 labs in the world.”When it comes to content, the India team provides customers ready-to-use parameterised virtual twins, he said. For instance, if a new  (EV) maker is looking to create a car or two-wheeler, they would be able to have a kind of parameterised chassis or powertrain infrastructure.“They will subscribe to this data, they will reshape them and it will accelerate the way they develop,” Charles said. “Most of the EV startup companies in the world are now using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.""Speaking about  (AI), he said the transformative potential of the technology was comparable to the internet. However, he highlighted some of its ethical implications and the need for regulations regarding data use.“The internet wave was an exciting wave of transformation for the world economy,” he said. “AI will be a similar lever for the economy but like for the internet wave, it took a while to provide the right services to citizens. The same will happen here, there will be many tries, failures and successes. It's a great moment because I think we can remove significant obstacles that we have to make the world more sustainable.”AI alone is a toolkit and one needs the right experiences and the right science to back it, he said, underscoring that ethical considerations need to be addressed to make AI valuable for society.“There are basic things that can be addressed well with regulation,” Charles said. “One of them is related to when data is produced by someone or used by someone else, the logic of consent is a very important, fair statement. The second big topic in the regulation is a clarification about IP (intellectual property) rights.”"

99,Are brands exploiting women for profit? A closer look at gender representation in advertising,"Apart from being a wake-up call for every other societal stakeholder, the gruesome rape and murder of a junior doctor at Kolkata's  and Medical College should also snap brand owners out of their sense of torpor. It would be the right time to conduct a course-correction regarding how  have been denied due respect for their meaningful, scalable as well as unique equity.Instead, brand owners and advertisers have largely continued to use them tactically as accelerators of emotions. Therefore, they remain purely opportunistic in intent and design.As an extension of cinematic stereotypes, women have ably performed their job as brand promoters. The iconic Leela Chitnis was the very first  lady, a tradition that extended to Hema Malini and Alia Bhatt. Karen Lunel embraced name and fame by her projection - and positioning under a waterfall - of the Liril Girl. Indian Tea was initially promoted by an incognito housewife, brewing the very imagery of warmth and endearment.Over time, the pure-play glamour persona was succeeded by more rational roles. Surf's Lalitaji personified the canny Indian housewife, while Horlicks bestowed due limelight on influential motherhood. This was a role crafted with further finesse by the new-age Bournvita mom, flaunting partnership in the success of her offspring, a critical departure from Nirupa Roy-style mollycoddling.Of late, the conventional role of intermediary is thankfully being succeeded by a necessary dose of empathy - women finally advocating the cause of self and peers, in a much overdue role evolution. Tanishq and Titan have done yeoman service to this cause, explicitly served by the exceptional Ogilvy creative process, inspiring and encouraging for a larger peer base from previously untapped demographics.According to a 2019 Boston Consulting Group report, 'Ten Trends That Are Altering Consumer Behaviour in India', women enjoy the last word in the majority of household purchase decisions (54%). Interestingly, this pattern is not limited to categories traditionally targeted at women. 51% of Indian women decide about their families' leisure travel plans, and 44% choose the brand of bikes and scooters.Women also exercise a different shopping pattern. When shopping for gadgets, men will look for a popular brand that they've researched online. Women, on the other hand, will visit multiple stores and take the time to hear what store associates have to say.The workforce participation rate for women in rural India is significantly higher at 41.8% than their equivalent in urban India (35.31%). This is not just in terms of 'clean data', but also pertaining to the psycho-demographic stature of women, which deserves more careful attention from .One way to begin is thoughtful privacy. Certain floors of  hotels, for instance, are specially reserved for female guests. The move by IndiGo to offer gender-dictated seating is also on these lines. Another relatively new-age development is the 'exclusive' financial product, the latest being 's 'Avni', to complement a plethora of competing offers. But these are essentially 'exclusionary' services, designed with solemn intent, but just the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Second stage is catering to psycho-demographic needs. For instance, while the basics of good nutrition are the same for all sexes, women have different needs for some nutrients, which change as they move through their reproductive lives. Smart, sensitive and India-centric organisations like ITC and  may invest in food products that are genetically personalised, yet mainstream. Think of 'lady food' as seriously as you think of 'baby food'.The most alluring opportunity resides in brand owners curating solutions that inspire a higher-end societal order, with seamless  being the ultimate intention. This should be done not by the conventional roadmap of routine segregation but by non-negotiable assimilation - to build an equitable universe where prejudice is never a source of pride.Like Air India insisting on an interest-based allocation of seating, gender no bar. Uber and Ola mandating a CCTV protocol for cabs, so that everybody can ride without fear or favour. Private schools, across the board and boards, insisting on coeducational formats from kindergarten onwards to normalise gender relations.The failure of the Jane Walker - ladies-only whisky - experiment proves succinctly how Johnnie Walker is the preferred brew for cross-cultural aficionados. Integrated washroom designs in premium hotels, subsequently escalated, to eliminate intrigue in civilised proceedings. The conventional narratives of protection through Raksha Bandhan and Bhai Dooj could well become succinct symbols of gender unification, quite like the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.So far, brands have done insufficient work or justice to women who embellish the wisdom and sanity of society. This could be a function of seasoned circumstance or thoughtless convention.The irrepressible momentum and turbulence currently underway in the wake of the RG Kar horror - and the equally horrific attempts for it to be 'normalised' in the face of political chicanery and one-up(wo)manship - may actually act as fuel to ensure that the brands we consume act as adhesives and propellers of a brand new social equilibrium. In such a landscape, men and women can genuinely co-create the present as we know it, and the future as we wish it.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

102,India's AI revolution: Balancing technological growth with environmental sustainability,"This week, two AI stalwarts - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun - are in India. (ET will be hosting an exclusive evening with Huang in Mumbai today.) Both visitors are forging and fast-forwarding many conversations, as India moves ahead to purchase 10,000  (GPUs).The GPU purchase is part of a project that will build robust  and reduce dependency on foreign computing resources at a crucial time when global GPU shortages and increasing costs are affecting AI development worldwide. However, this AI push across sectors brings a challenge: the massive energy consumption required to power the tech.As India embraces AI, it must chart a course that balances tech advancement with environmental responsibility. Training a single LLM can consume as much energy as 100 Indian households use in one year. With India's AI sector projected to grow exponentially, the environmental impact of unchecked AI development could be substantial. Yet, this challenge also presents an opportunity for India to pioneer  practices that could serve as a model for developing nations.The country's robust IT infra, combined with technical talent, positions it uniquely to develop  solutions. Several Indian institutes are working on 'green AI' initiatives, focusing on algorithms that require less computational power while delivering comparable results.GoI's recent policy push for AI development through initiatives like Digital India and National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence demonstrates its commitment. However, these initiatives must be complemented by a framework for sustainable AI development. This should include: A few steps can make India's AI journey more sustainable:  Traditional data centres consume massive amounts of power for both computing and cooling. By adopting advanced cooling technologies and optimising server utilisation, power consumption can be reduced by up to 40%. The case of 100% direct liquid cooling, as implemented by Eviden in a few European projects, is pertinent as it reduces space and energy requirements. GoI's green data centre guidelines are a step in the right direction. But implementation needs to be accelerated.  Organisations should prioritise efficient model training. Techniques like  and model pruning can reduce the computational resources required for AI training. Indian startups are developing innovative solutions, creating lighter, more efficient AI models that maintain accuracy while consuming less power.India must leverage its RE potential. Its ambitious solar power goals align perfectly with the growing energy demands of AI infra. By mandating that AI facilities source a significant portion of their power from RE sources, India can ensure its AI growth doesn't come at the cost of environmental degradation.Economic benefits of sustainable AI are substantial. Energy-efficient AI solutions reduce operational costs and also create new market opportunities. Indian companies developing sustainable AI technologies could become global leaders in this increasingly important sector.However, challenges remain. Initial cost of implementing sustainable AI infra is high, and many organisations might be tempted to prioritise short-term gains over long-term sustainability. This is where policy intervention becomes crucial. Government incentives, tax benefits and clear regulatory frameworks can help bridge the gap between immediate costs and long-term benefits.Choices made today will shape tomorrow's tech future and environmental impact. By prioritising sustainability in its AI development strategy, India can demonstrate that technological advancement and environmental responsibilities are not mutually exclusive, but complementary goals that strengthen each other.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

103,"Murder case against Kannada Superstar Darshan Thoogudeepa takes on political tinge, BJP MP Bommai calls for impartial probe","BJP MP (Haveri) Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday sought an impartial and thorough probe into the murder of a private sector employee  allegedly by  Darshan, his girlfriend  and their accomplices. Darshan had campaigned for former MP Sumalatha Ambareesh in Mandya in the 2019 LS polls. The  has taken a  with members of the prominent Veerashaiva-Lingayat community in the victim’s hometown Chitradurga demanding justice for the 33-year-old Renukaswamy.Former chief minister Bommai, who belongs to the  as well, called the murder inhuman. “Whether someone was in power or was a celebrity, none enjoyed special privileges. Everyone was equal before the law,” he told the media at Hubballi. This was a premeditated murder, he added, while urging the government to sustain the initial vigour and integrity throughout the investigation. The Bengaluru City Police on Tuesday arrested Darshan on charges of involvement in the murder, enraged by the victim allegedly sending some obscene messages to his girlfriend. Locals in Chitradurga, also home to an prominent Lingayat religious seat, took over a procession on Wednesday demanding justice for the family of the victim, while the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha has urged the government to support the victim’s family and provide compensation. Renukaswamy, reportedly working at a pharmacy in Bengaluru, was found dead in the city on June 8. According to the police, he was allegedly tortured and killed, before his body was dumped in a drain in Kamakshipalya, close to the police station. As per the probe, Renukaswamy was allegedly beaten up with a belt and sticks and then thrown against a wall, leading to his death. Darshan, who rose to fame with the Kannada film ‘Majestic’ in 2001, has been the centre of several cases, and has faced charges for assault before.BJP state party president BY Vijayendra expressed his condolences towards the victim, and said he hoped the government would tighten the investigation. ""The case of brutal killing of Chitradurga youth Renukaswamy is very inhumane and condemnable. The allegation against actor Darshan and others is a very worrying incident,"" he said in a post on social media platform X.In a major development, Renukaswamy’s wife Sahana gave a statement to the media, claiming she was three months pregnant, and demanding justice for her husband. “My husband called me on June 8 afternoon. If my husband had sent derogatory messages on social media, he should have been given a warning. What was the need to kill him? Whether he [Darshan] is an actor or a star, I want justice,” she said."

105,AI power in rural Bihar: How i-Saksham is empowering young women  with help from Google’s AI,", a Bihar-based organisation, is empowering young women to become change-makers in their communities through fellowship programmes designed and implemented using artificial intelligence (AI).The not-for-profit organisation focuses primarily on growing these women’s self-confidence and economic empowerment through its programs, while also helping build their familiarity and trust in technology, assisting many of them with access to their first-ever smartphone.Through their focused two-year fellowship program called “Edu-Leaders Fellowship”, i-Saksham gives the benificiaries 200 hours of intensive training to equip them with teaching and leadership capabilities, as well as essential life skills, including digital and financial literacy. i-Saksham has leveraged 's AI capabilities to improve the effectiveness of coaching and mentorship programmes. The beneficiaries can apply these learnings in the real world to enhance educational inclusion and learning experiences of underserved children, while also working with communities towards bridging the gender gap. In India, gender disparities and systemic inequalities continue to stand in the way of growth. The 2023 Gender Social Norms Index of the United Nations Development Programme reveals that around 75% of the population in India holds an economic bias against women’s right to work. The 's recent Global Gender Gap Report 2024 ranked India at the 129th position. i-Saksham wants to improve this situation. An inspiring example of the transformation was seen when an i-Saksham fellow’s dedication to  drove social progress in her village in , says the non-profit. By applying the teaching skills she had gained in a programme, she increased girls’ attendance in school; helped six girls who had dropped out in Class VIII return to school and pass their exams; and empowered parents to support their children’s education. She also advocated against early marriage, enabling over 20 of her peers to pursue higher studies. The impact she created has inspired the community's women. They are now acquiring literacy skills and can now sign their names instead of relying on thumbprints, it explains. This fosters a sense of empowerment and dignity.i-Saksham’s mentors have also been using  to navigate difficult and sensitive conversations with programme fellows. In one instance, a mentor used the platform to provide a fellow the guidance to have a conversation with her family members after they insisted she get married instead of pursuing a master’s programme at a prestigious university on a scholarship. Gemini even helped model how the fellow could approach such a nuanced exchange.Elaborating on Google AI’s impact, Harsh Dhand, Research and AI Partnerships, APAC lead, Google, says, “Our core belief is that technology's greatest potential lies in empowering everyone. This principle fuels our relentless pursuit of advanced AI, powering products like Gemini and platforms like Google AI Studio. Seeing these capabilities being so thoughtfully deployed by organisations like i-Saksham to empower women and drive meaningful change is incredibly gratifying, further validating our purpose to deliver technology that is beneficial and accessible for all. It's a testament to how AI, when built with purpose, can amplify positive impact and be a force multiplier for good, far beyond our labs.”               In a pilot project, i-Saksham found that Google’s AI-generated output provided almost 90% accuracy in Hindi-language transcription and translation to English, especially in capturing linguistic nuances. When scaled up, the organisation believes these capabilities could drastically reduce the time its trainers spend on processing and acting on insights from mentorship sessions from 5-7 days to 60 seconds. Aditya Tyagi, Co-Founder and Lead, i-Saksham, says, “This can have a high impact on our abilities to scale up while deepening the effectiveness of our model. It can free up the time of the buddies from data entry and reporting. Thus, with the support of technology, a buddy can guide 15-20 programme fellows, instead of the present 6-10. We're excited at the prospect of exploring and finding new ways for AI to help us save both time and cost.”Since 2017, i-Saksham has trained over 600 such fellows in 200+ villages across 5 districts, all of whom have further impacted over 12,000 girls and children. It envisions building a network of 10,000 women leaders who will mentor and inspire a million girls and women towards greater self-reliance by 2030.Tyagi says recent strides in AI have shattered the language and articulation barrier, democratising access to personalised and contextualised learning, while empowering educators with tools to create more inclusive content. AI is also revolutionising how civil society organisations process vast amounts of qualitative data, leading to faster and more informed decision-making that can also accelerate the pace, scale and intensity of change. “While changing deep-rooted perceptions of gender roles is a long-term endeavour, Google's AI technologies are proving to be invaluable tools in our progress towards transforming the lives of young women and girls, paving the way for a brighter and more equitable future,” he adds."
106,Buying a house? These are the most and least affordable cities in India in 2024; full list,"Which is the most  to live in India in 2024? A recent report by MagicBricks examined two key metrics — the price-to-income ratio and the EMI-to-income ratio — across the country to find out. The report, titled 'Housing Affordability in Major Indian Cities 2024' has revealed Chennai, Ahmedabad, and Kolkata are the most affordable destinations for residential investments in India in 2024. It used a globally recognised affordability benchmark of a price-to-income ratio of 5 or lower to assess the affordability of various cities. According to the report, property prices in these three cities are more in line with local incomes, making housing more accessible to residents. This suggests that the real estate markets in these cities are relatively balanced.The report also highlighted the trend of rising housing costs nationwide. In the past four years, average housing prices in India have increased by 46%, with Hyderabad and Noida experiencing particularly steep rises of 78.6% and 69%, respectively.While household incomes in the top 10 cities grew at a CAGR of 5.4% between 2020 and 2024, property prices surged at a CAGR of 9.3%, exacerbating the affordability challenge. The price-to-income ratio, a key indicator of affordability, has risen from 6.6 in 2020 to 7.5 in 2024, indicating that housing has become less affordable as property prices have outpaced average income growth.Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Delhi emerged as the least affordable cities, with price-to-income ratios of 14.3 and 10.1, respectively. Gurugram also faces substantial affordability pressures with a ratio of 7.5. These figures show the widening gap between property prices and household incomes in these urban centres.While cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Gurugram offer higher household incomes, making it easier for residents to afford homes in cities with lower property prices like Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata, and Pune, home seekers from cities with lower incomes face unaffordability concerns across the country.The rising  is another indicator of affordability. From 46% in 2020, this ratio has increased to 61% in 2024, reflecting the growing burden of EMIs on home buyers. New Delhi has an EMI-to-monthly income ratio of 82%, while the MMR, Gurugram, and Hyderabad have EMI-to-monthly income ratios of 116%, 61%, and 61%, respectively. In contrast, cities like Ahmedabad, Chennai, and Kolkata offer more favourable conditions with EMIs below 50% of monthly income.The EMI to monthly household income ratio across various cities indicates the proportion of a household's monthly income towards the payment of home loan EMIs. In cities like Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata, and Pune, most buyers were paying just about 50% of their income in EMIs. Conversely, in cities such as Gurugram, Hyderabad, MMR, and New Delhi, the EMI to monthly household income ratio often exceeds 50% of the monthly income, signifying a greater financial strain on homeowners.Sudhir Pai, CEO, of Magicbricks, shared ""Between the latter half of 2021 and 2022, residential investments were at their most affordable. During this period, the market was experiencing a resurgence, characterized by low interest rates, recovering household incomes, and a modest increase in residential prices. However, homeownership sentiment has since peaked, resulting in demand significantly outpacing available supply, leading to a rapid and substantial surge in residential prices, presenting new challenges for affordable housing."""

110,"Skilled Indians, go forth & prosper","In a 2001 Chicago-Kent Law Review essay, 'Why Some Countries Are Rich and Some Are Poor', economist Douglass North asked, '...if we know about what makes countries rich and what makes them poor, why do we have poverty in the world?'There are no simple answers to this question. While the West attributes poverty in poor countries to weak institutions, many achieved affluence by leveraging . Surplus capital from North America and Western Europe, combined with high demand and purchasing power of their populations, allowed capital to flow to China and Southeast Asia. This influx of investment created jobs for millions, and sparked a manufacturing boom that eradicated poverty in East Asia.Conversely, however, Western countries have imposed non-economic barriers to restrict , mainly to preserve cultural and demographic identities. As a result, the neoclassical idea that free trade would eliminate poverty by equalising wages between high- and low-income nations has been undermined.Labour migration from low-wage to high-wage countries has stalled over the past half-century despite the wage gap. For example, the average carpenter in Germany starting out in his profession gets €703 a month. The average construction operator gets €809 a month. In India, their counterparts gets ₹26,000, or €270. These wage differentials have persisted because of legal barriers to free flow of labour across markets.Thomas Piketty has showed how wealth creation across time in the developed world has led to increasing inequality. The share of income of capitalist owners (profit) is increasing relative to the share of workers (wages). But ageing populations in Western Europe and Japan can incentivise flow of skilled workers and caregivers from developing world, reducing growing inequality.Ageing demography of the developed world has created a great opportunity for India to eliminate its poverty and enhance quality of life of a vast number of Indians in a single generation. The developed world's deficit of physical skills - from healthcare workers and coders to infrastructure builders - can be filled in next 50 years by India. , with government-to-government agreements to safeguard wages and social security of migrant workers in destination countries, is a win-win option.But despite India having requisite skilled workers, it has not been easy for it to fill the global skills gap. For starters, language barriers in non-anglophonic developed countries have restricted access. Further, G-to-G agreements for circular migration require exact skill-matching and have many legal compliances. These include acquiring a passport - hard for lesser educated workers - and demonstration of required skills to the receiving country. (NSDC) has aggregated demand of skill gaps for many of India's partner countries. Maharashtra Institution for Transformation (MITRA), working closely with NSDC under the skill development ministry, GoI, and Maharashtra state departments of labour and employment have evolved SOPs and policy norms over the last few months so that skilled young Indians can access higher wage markets under G-to-G agreements.Skilled Indian workers need to demonstrate their skills. Hence, they need a booster training. NSDC has developed a 4-day Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) course that's relevant to upgrade existing skills. Data of nearly 2 lakh construction workers in trades including plastering, ceramic tiling, form work and bar bending have been registered and updated with the Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers' Welfare Board.Some 6,000 workers were recently identified, and they participated in booster training in English and construction skills. This has given candidates a competitive edge in tests to be conducted by Israel Builders Association. This was followed up with helping candidates with requisite documents, including passports, and matching Israeli work requirements.MITRA is creating a dynamic database of willing young Indians in specific skills that match needs of partner countries like Israel, Japan and Germany. The Maharashtra government has also taken a policy decision to provide Japanese, German and French language-learning in ITIs and vocational institutes.Ultimately, as non-economic artificial barriers for free movement of workers fall, India should position itself to become the global source of human capital.( Originally published on Oct 11, 2024 )(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

He remained optimistic about domestic demand maintaining its upward trajectory. Pereira also flagged the need for continued emphasis on improvement in the country’s business climate and skill sets.“India is the champion of growth in G20 and continues to show a very strong and broad-based performance,” Pereira told ET in an interview. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) raised the country’s growth forecast to 6.7% for FY25 and 6.8% for FY26, a revision of 1 and 2 basis points, respectively, with an upside risk.“Solid domestic demand growth is projected to continue in India and Indonesia over the next two years,” OECD said in the September update of its , released on Wednesday.Pereira ruled out the risk of a middle income trap, saying India will keep driving strong growth as long as good macroeconomic management continues. “If India continues to grow 7%, for example—hopefully, it can grow even more—it means that per capita income will double every 10 years. So, it’s a fantastic rate of growth.”The OECD chief economist said India is “one of the G20 countries that reformed the most over the past seven to eight years, liberalising many parts of the economy and introducing significant reforms in several sectors. This has led to a significant boost in investment and growth”. He also called ‘’, which completed 10 years of its rollout Wednesday, a significant reform that led to diversification of the manufacturing sector.Noting that India needs to continue to improve ease of doing business, invest in skills, and cut red tape, he added, “The reform path we have seen in the past few years needs to continue, to attract more investment, both local and foreign, and make the country more integrated with global chains.”According to Pereira, the economy must keep opening up along with infrastructure upgrade. He stated that risks for India were “fairly balanced,” even as they were tilted towards the negative in other parts of the world. He identified geopolitical factors and their impact on trade and the financial markets as concerns.World growth has been resilient, though Europe has not been doing so well, Pereira said, adding, “It is a picture of solid growth — resilient not stellar.”OECD had forecast a growth of 3.2% for the world economy. The world has turned a corner, he said, with most central banks of now expecting headline inflation to come closer to target. OECD secretary-general Mathias Cormann said falling inflation provides room for easing of interest rates, though monetary policy should remain prudent until inflation has returned to central bank targets. He stressed on decisive policy action to rebuild the fiscal space by improving spending efficiency, reallocating expenses to areas that better support opportunities and growth, and optimising tax revenues."
114,How to sell your house: Resellers are having a hard time finding buyers; how homeowners can improve the saleability of their property,"Nandini Upadhye’s spacious 2.5-BHK  at Ghatkopar, Mumbai, is a catch. Located within walking distance of the Metro and railway station, the housing complex offers quick connectivity with the nearby Eastern Express Highway. The 15-storey, nine-year-old complex has a gym and children’s play area, apart from conveniences such as a lift and covered car parking. The apartment offers a generous living area, complete with a 8x10 feet balcony, a luxury in a city like Mumbai. Yet, the 61-year-old has been struggling to find takers for the dwelling for the past several months. Listing the  on online broker platforms has yielded a muted response. The apartment, with an asking price of Rs.1.6-1.7 crore, is still unsold. The Upadhyes may have to sell below the market value.For many  in premier cities, reality is hitting hard. The residential housing market has been running hot in recent years. New project launches have witnessed frenetic buying. Despite this housing boom, resellers are having a hard time finding buyers on their terms. Pune-based operations manager Shailesh Kamath, 38, recently sold his apartment in the city’s Wagholi area for Rs.32.5 lakh, after holding out at over Rs.40 lakh. Although relieved to have secured the sale after a year of seeking a buyer, he is filled with regret. He had bought the 2-BHK house in 2016 for Rs.32 lakh. After eight years, Kamath has netted a paltry gain of Rs.50,000 on his property. Effectively, he has incurred a loss on his , after considering maintenance and other charges over the years.Many others are finding it tough to offload their prized . For some, it is a source of stress and anxiety. We explore what is preventing sellers from finding buyers. We also suggest ways homeowners can improve the saleability of their assets and what prospective buyers can learn from sellers’ experiences.Often, homes go unsold for no fault of the seller. Any ongoing disputes over the land or faulty documentation will naturally put off buyers. Deficiency in basic amenities like water supply or parking space can scupper any deal. At times, the builder’s mismanagement or connivance can render the housing complex practically unlivable, making resale a tricky proposition.Honey Jagyasi, 35, bought a flat in a sprawling 28-tower township project of a prominent developer, in Thane, in 2020. She later discovered that the township, divided into multiple clusters with distinct housing societies, faces continuous internal disputes over the use of common amenities like club house, swimming pool, etc. Four years ago, the builder raised maintenance charges unfairly for new residents, and Jagyasi’s cluster has been restricted from accessing certain facilities. Unable to sell the apartment for the past two-anda-half years, she has seen no appreciation in its Rs.80 lakh value. “This experience has taught me a harsh lesson,” she laments. “I am never buying property again, definitely not in a gated community. I will prefer staying on rent.”Sellers often misjudge their property’s value, and incorrect pricing is a major reason many resale homes remain unsold. Even slight overpricing can reduce buyer interest and prolong the sale, says Sahil Verma, COO, Shray Projects. Sellers often set wrong expectations. Ravi Shankar Singh, Managing Director, Residential Transaction Services, Colliers India, asserts, “In the current market, there is a restricted supply of ready-to-move-in products. So the seller expectations are high and most of them are just listing for the sake of price discovery, without any serious intent to sell.”Sellers often overvalue their property due to emotional attachment and fail to consider its condition relative to the market average. “Sellers need to realise they can’t compare their property’s price directly with newer gated projects offering superior amenities,” Verma notes. Older properties typically sell for 10-15% less than the new ones. In some markets, the gap can be bigger.Buyers are well-acquainted with the latest price trends. Sumit Jain, Chief Business Officer, Square Yards, remarks, “Today’s buyers, whether end-users or investors, are well-informed and have access to tools that allow them to compare properties easily. If a property is overpriced or doesn’t align with buyers’ preferences, they are likely to avoid it.”Buyers show preference for newer projects with modern amenities and features.  Singh further points out that buyers are also cognisant of their financial readiness. Under-construction properties are preferred by aspirational buyers who do not want to commit to a huge financial outflow at once. Jayesh Rathod, Director and Co-founder of The Guardians Real Estate Advisory, adds, “In areas with many older homes, buyers often choose newer projects, especially when developers offer incentives like EMI holidays or discounts.”Newly constructed homes and gated communities also offer several advantages over resale homes, attracting most buyers. Jain asserts, “Buyer preferences, particularly among end-users, have shifted towards properties with modern amenities and strong security features, making gated communities highly desirable. Older homes or projects that lack these features may struggle to compete in the market and may not appeal as strongly to buyers.” Rathod says, “Many buyers are drawn to new launches or under-construction projects that offer facilities like gyms, pools and parks. Older homes can be less appealing because of outdated amenities, or the need for repairs.”Verma suggests modern homebuyers often have different priorities compared to previous generations. “Energy efficiency and smart home features are increasingly important. Open floor plans and multifunctional spaces are preferred over traditional layouts,” he says. Buyers also don’t mind paying a premium for apartments in projects developed by marquee brands.Developers under pressure to push sales of unsold stock.   Real estate is a favoured asset for many Indian households, with expectations of strong capital appreciation. However, its relative illiquidity often surprises sellers. Verma of Shray Projects explains, “Real estate market liquidity is uneven. While properties in prime locations or with sought-after features may sell quickly, others can stay on the market for long periods.” Even during a housing boom, a quick or profitable sale isn’t guaranteed, adds Verma. Housing market experts maintain that the perceived liquidity of real estate is actually an illusion.Rathod avers, “Real estate is generally an illiquid asset, meaning it can take time to sell, even in a good market. This is due to the lengthy process of documentation, legal checks, and the large financial commitment required from buyers.” Singh of Colliers India maintains, “While residential real estate has historically offered good capital appreciation, I strongly believe this should not be treated as a financial investment product. It has to be more need-driven and one should look at buying a house to upgrade their existing lifestyle.”   Buyers should remain selective about their house purchases, insist experts. Jain remarks, “Factors such as location, future development potential, market trends and property appreciation should be carefully evaluated to ensure a solid investment.” The preference for newer gated communities shows they often have better resale value and liquidity than older standalone homes, making future demand key to investment decisions, says Rathod.Kamath, who bought his Pune apartment without proper market study, real ises now that he overpaid for the apartment and misjudged its potential. “It is critical to understand the local market. If only I had explored trends in the vicinity, I would have negotiated a better pricing,” rues Kamath. The development of buildings, roads and amenities nearby can either boost or diminish a property’s appeal. These are factors homeowners can’t control. Upadhye, whose Mumbai apartment remains unsold, believes the nearby Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority tenements are reducing her complex’s appeal.Sellers struggling to find buyers shouldn’t lose hope. While newer developments attract most attention, many buyers still seek good deals in the resale market. Concerns over delays in under-construction houses often push buyers towards ready-to-movein properties. The seller should make the right pitch. Verma says, “Remember, while you may not be able to offer all the amenities of a brand-new development, your property may have its own advantages, whether it’s character, location or potential for customisation. Highlight these strengths while addressing potential concerns proactively.”   To maintain the appeal of your property, do not neglect its upkeep. Make sure to address deficiencies, such as leakages and cracks, before inviting bidders. “Simple upgrades like fresh paint, updated fixtures, or landscaping can also enhance the property’s appeal,” remarks Jain.Maintain visibility of your property to potential buyers. Simply listing the property on online platforms may not attract eyeballs. In this digital age, the way a property is presented online is crucial, insists Verma. “Poor quality photos or limited visual content can deter potential buyers. Properties that are poorly marketed may not reach their full potential audience, regardless of market conditions,” he adds. Jain says, “Professional staging and highquality photography are crucial for online listings, helping buyers visualise the space and boosting interest.”The housing market is booming, but resellers are being forced to temper their expectations.   Additionally, onboarding experienced and credible RERA-registered brokers to outsource sales can fetch better, localised insights into market trends and speed up the selling process. Setting realistic pricing is important too. “Pricing the property competitively by following market trends and getting a professional valuation can help set realistic expectations,” suggests The Guardians’ Rathod.Finally, make sure your property stands up to any scrutiny. “Anticipate and prepare for detailed inspections. Have all relevant documents and certificates readily available,” says Verma. Many homeowners are unaware of key documents like title deeds, conveyance deeds, and encumbrance certificates. Missing paperwork can derail property sale efforts.The sellers who align their expectations with market conditions, invest in necessary updates, and market their properties effectively are more likely to find buyers, even in a competitive landscape.

116,At odds with the Multi Dimensional Poverty Index story?,"'Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable,' Mark Twain had said at one point.  and 's recently released  Index (): A Progress Review 2023 reminds us how numbers could be pliable for purpose.Amartya Sen offered a new perspective on well-being in his 1987 book, Commodities and Capabilities. Sceptical of real income comparisons, he argued that well-being is a much broader concept and so must focus on capabilities and functionings. While capabilities are abilities to do this or that in a free and fair environment, functionings reflect achievements. The ability to live a healthy and rewarding life is not necessarily related to affluence.An affluent person may be obese and, thus, vulnerable to, say, cardiovascular diseases. Functionings are achievements such as being healthy, closely related to a nourishing diet and a physically demanding lifestyle. However, Sen has avoided aggregation of capabilities into an overall well-being index as he believes each capability is important. Unfortunately, UNDP seized this concept and developed it into an overall Human Development Index (HDI) with uniform weights.MPI 2023, also rooted in Sen's capability idea, considers three components and their sub-indices: health, education and standard of living. Sub-indices of health include nutrition, and child and adult mortality; education comprises years of schooling and school attendance; standard of living includes sanitation, housing and electricity use. These are aggregated into MPI using equal weights. This aggregation goes against considering each capability being important and there being no case for aggregation. Uniform weighting is arbitrary and has no foundation in ethics.MPI estimates show a near-halving of India's national MPI value and a decline from 24.85% to 14.96% between 2015-16 and 2019-21. This reduction of 9.89 percentage points implies that about 135.5 million persons have exited poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21. Besides, the intensity of poverty, which measures the average deprivation among the people living in multidimensional poverty, reduced from 47.14% to 44.39%.These findings elicit scepticism for three reasons: NFHS rounds 4 and 5 are hardly suitable for such a wide-ranging study unless combined with the NSS rounds of household consumption expenditure survey. The NSS 75th round of household consumption expenditure survey was scrapped since leaked data indicated a sharp rise in poverty. The suspension of the demographer in charge of NFHS 5 over findings that contradicted GoI's claims of success in eliminating open defecation does not elicit confidence. GDP growth has declined: 8% in 2015-16, 3.78% in 2019-20 and -6.60% in 2020-21, as also per-capita income. Covid-19 destroyed livelihoods and took lives. With a likely decline in public expenditure that finances expansion and maintenance of schooling, medical services and sanitation, the extraordinary reduction in MPI is suspect.Our econometric analysis offers corroborative evidence. MPI and per-capita income have a strong negative correlation. So, if income decelerated as much as it did, MPI would rise. A 1% reduction in per-capita income is associated with an increase of 0.94 in MPI. The Piketty index of income inequality has a positive association with MPI. So, if this index rose by 1%, MPI rose by 0.22%.Finally, a 1% increase in the number of states ruled by BJP and its allies is associated with a rise of 0.09% in MPI. This is unsurprising since NDA's policies have been far from inclusive, and the social safety nets have weakened.( Originally published on Aug 05, 2023 )(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

117,Orissa High Court says surrogate mothers also entitled to maternity leave,"In a landmark ruling, the Orissa High Court directed the state  to grant  to a surrogate mother, saying that leave privileges shouldn't depend on how a person became a mother. A single-judge bench ruled in favour of a  (OFS) officer, granting her 180 days maternity leave after she became a parent through . ""Maternity leave should be granted to employees who become mothers through surrogacy to ensure treatment and support for all new mothers, irrespective of how they become parents,"" Justice S K Panigrahi ruled.  Supriya Jena filed a petition in 2020 after the Odisha government denied her maternity leave, with the court finally ruling in her favour on June 25, telling the state government that if maternity leave is applicable to an adoptive mother it should be applicable to a surrogate one. ""Additionally, the initial period after the birth of a child is crucial for the mother's involvement in caregiving and nurturing, which is pivotal for the child's development. Accordingly, the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to motherhood and also, the right of every child to full development,""  said.The bench, in its ruling, also directed the state government to incorporate these aspects in the relevant rules to treat mothers equally. ""It is directed to the concerned department of the state to incorporate this aspect in the relevant provisions of the rules to treat a child born out of surrogacy in the similar manner as a child born out of the natural process and provide the commissioning mother with all the benefits provided thereto,"" the judge said. Justice Panigrahi pointed out that providing maternity leave to surrogate mothers ensures they have the necessary time to create a stable and loving environment for their children.""Additionally, international conventions to which India is a signatory, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  Against Women, mandate  and non-discrimination in matters related to employment and maternity,"" he added."
118,"India must embrace a hybrid model that aligns research with industry needs, and avoid the US path"," recently launched the  (ANRF), marking a pivotal shift in India's research landscape. With a budget of ₹50k cr over five years, the initiative aims to transform India's  by aligning academic research with industry needs, driving practical, solution-oriented innovation. The PM emphasised that India must focus on local solutions to global challenges, signalling a move toward directed , rather than purely speculative work.This is an exciting and visionary initiative. However, to succeed, India must avoid the pitfalls of the US research system, which, despite vast investments in basic research, is often disconnected from real-world applications. The US spends over $130 bn annually on academic research. Yet, much of it remains locked in the 'Valley of Death', where promising research never transitions into marketable solutions. As former dean of engineering at Duke University, Tom Katsouleas had told me, based on his work with the US National Academy of Engineering, 'Only about 1% of university patents are ever commercialised.'The American research ecosystem is heavily focused on 'publish or perish' - a culture where academic researchers are incentivised to produce numerous publications to secure tenure and funding. This has created a glut of research papers, many of which lack practical value or impact. Most of this research is disconnected from industry and real-world problems, advancing academic careers, but offering little societal benefit. While programmes like Darpa (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) have had some notable successes, such as the internet, the majority of US basic research remains trapped in academic journals.India cannot afford to replicate these inefficiencies. Instead, it must leverage its ability to blend basic research with practical applications - ensuring that innovations align with market and societal needs from the start - something it has already demonstrated it can do successfully as it did with its $254 bn IT industry. Companies like ,  and  didn't invent microchips or operating systems. But they built global empires by applying and integrating these technologies to solve real-world problems. This model - leveraging what already exists - is efficient, profitable and scalable.One of the best examples of successful industry-academic collaboration in the world is at , led by V Kamakoti, with Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam and Jayaraj Joseph leading the Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre (HTIC). Instead of wasting time and money chasing scientific rainbows or reinventing the wheel, they partner with industry to adapt and apply cutting-edge technologies, producing affordable, scalable healthcare solutions tailored to India's needs.HTIC has already developed transformative healthcare technologies, such as mobile surgical units that deliver cataract surgeries to rural areas, and diagnostic devices that enable early detection of eye diseases. The Sudha Gopalakrishnan Brain Centre, recently showcased by Nvidia, is pushing the boundaries of neuro-imaging and AI diagnostics, processing entire human brains into hi-res images at a scale that surpasses even the most advanced labs in the West. In addition to advancing brain health, it will provide new insights into how the brain functions, potentially leading to breakthroughs in cognitive science, machine-learning, and even the development of brain-computer interfaces.When I visited IIT Madras earlier this year, I was blown away by the talent, world-class facilities, and their ability to connect with top scientists across India. I was so impressed that I decided to outsource the development of breakthrough technologies for my company, , to them. Frankly, I told my friends and VCs in Silicon Valley where I live, that IIT Madras puts MIT, Duke, Stanford - and the Valley itself - to shame in terms of intellectual capacity, scale, ambition and readiness to collaborate.I've been more than amazed by the progress IIT Madras has already made in building technologies that could never be built in the West. The last company that tried to develop what we're doing was Theranos, which burned through $1.4 bn on medical diagnostics that are nowhere near the advanced solutions IIT has already created - at a tiny fraction of the cost.The World Bank, IMF and Western academics constantly preach to India that it must increase its investment in basic research. They point to India's R&D expenditure, currently just 0.7% of GDP, in stark contrast with countries such as the US and China, whose R&D investments respectively exceed 2% and 3% of GDP. Yes, India must do more research. But it must focus on the future rather than the past - as Westerners advocate and do themselves.We are living in an era of exponential technologies - AI, robotics, sensors, synthetic biology, nanotech - that are converging to create trillion-dollar industries at an unprecedented pace. The foundational research required for these advancements has already been done. India's real challenge and opportunity lie in identifying the convergence of these technologies and driving innovation through practical applications. Vionix's partnership with IIT Madras - leveraging advanced AI, sensors and plasma technology to revolutionise medical diagnostics - demonstrates what can be achieved when India plays to its strengths.Academics are usually trapped in silos and too focused on narrow, specialised fields. Silicon Valley is equally guilty - isolated in its bubble, throwing billions at redundant, incremental technologies with little real-world impact. If India focuses its research investments on convergence and implementation, it won't just follow existing paths, it will also set the global standard for the next wave of innovation.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

122,Navigating the waves: Emerging themes in the Indian stock market,"The  is a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape, mirroring the broader economic shifts within the country and the global economic environment. As India continues its journey toward becoming an economic powerhouse, new themes are emerging in the stock market, presenting compelling opportunities for . These themes are shaped by a combination of technological advancements,  policies, changing consumer behavior, and global trends. This article explores some of the emerging themes in the Indian stock market.In recent years, digital transformation has become central to business strategies across various sectors in India. The rise of digital payment platforms, e-commerce, and fintech has been particularly noteworthy. These sectors are leveraging  not only to enhance consumer experiences but also to drive financial inclusion on an unprecedented scale. The government's push towards a cashless , combined with increasing internet penetration and smartphone usage, has created fertile ground for growth in these areas.Moreover, the digital revolution is not confined to consumer-facing industries. Enterprise technology solutions, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, are also transforming how businesses operate. Sustainability has emerged as a critical theme in the global investment landscape, and India is no exception. The Indian government’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 has spurred a wave of investments in green energy. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, are receiving significant attention from both policymakers and investors.The push towards sustainability is also driving innovation in energy storage solutions, electric vehicles (EVs), and clean technologies. Battery technology, a key component of the EV ecosystem, is another area where investors are keenly watching for breakthroughs.Additionally, there is a growing trend towards environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. Investors are increasingly considering the long-term environmental and social impact of their investments. COVID-19 pandemic underscored healthcare sector’s importance like never before. In response to the challenges posed by the pandemic, there has been a surge in innovation within the healthcare and biotechnology sectors. This has opened up new investment opportunities in areas such as pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical devices, and telemedicine.Biotechnology, in particular, is emerging as a significant theme. Investors are now increasingly focusing on companies involved in research and development of new drugs and therapies.The Indian consumer landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by rising incomes, urbanization, and changing lifestyles. One of the prominent trends is shift towards premiumization, where consumers are increasingly opting for higher-quality, branded products and services over budget alternatives.This trend is evident across various sectors, including consumer goods, automobiles, real estate, and financial services. The government’s focus on building world-class infrastructure, including roads, railways, airports, and smart cities, is creating significant opportunities in the construction, engineering, and real estate sectors.The real estate sector, which had been facing challenges due to regulatory changes and liquidity issues, is now showing signs of revival. The implementation of reforms such as the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act and the introduction of affordable housing schemes have provided a much-needed boost to the sector. Urbanization and the development of smart cities are other themes that are likely to drive growth in the real estate and infrastructure sectors. The global supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic have prompted companies worldwide to reconsider their manufacturing and sourcing strategies. The Indian government’s “Make in India” initiative, coupled with the Production-Linked Incentive schemes, is positioning the country as an attractive destination for manufacturing.Sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles may benefit from this shift. In addition, the focus on domestic manufacturing is expected to boost ancillary industries such as logistics, warehousing, and industrial automation. The Indian  is on the brink of significant transformation, driven by a range of emerging themes that reflect broader economic, technological, and societal shifts. For investors, staying attuned to these trends and identifying the right opportunities will be key to navigating the complexities of the market and achieving long-term success.(The author is Co-CIO Equity, LIC Mutual Fund)(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

127,Industrial production contracts for first time in nearly 2 years,"’s  contracted 0.1% in August, the first time it shrank in 22 months, pulled down by an unfavourable base and a drop in mining and , official data released Friday showed. The Index of  had risen 4.7% in July and 10.9% in August 2023. For the first five months of the current financial year, industrial growth was 4.2% compared with 6.2% in the corresponding period last year. The contraction came on the back of a decline in the eight core industries of 1.8% in August, according to data released last month. The eight industries have a weight of 40.27% in . Manufacturing activity, according to the HSBC Purchase Managers’ Index, stood at a three-month low of 57.5 in August.Economists largely attributed the decline in August to the big jump in the year-earlier period. “The slowdown was on account of an unfavourable base,” said Rajni Sinha, chief economist, CareEdge. Sinha said heavy rain in August may have led to the slowdown in mining, which recorded a decline of 4.3%. Electricity output fell 3.7%.Economists expect a pick-up in activity on the back of a normal monsoon and the onset of the festive season. “The impact of a healthy monsoon on rural demand is expected to kick in the second half of this fiscal, which would support consumption,” said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil. Domestic demand is expected to rise in the early part of the festive season, Sinha said. A broad-based improvement in consumption and private capital expenditure is crucial for driving industrial activity.  slowed to 1%, the lowest in nearly two years.Ind-Ra sees IIP returning to positive territory. High-frequency indicators suggest a pickup in industrial activity, Paras Jasrai of Ind-Ra said in a note.Although the manufacturing growth was down to a 22-month low, it came on a high base,” he said. “The growth of e-way bill and coal production improved to 18.5% year on year and 2.5% YoY in September 2024, respectively (August 2024: 12.9% YoY, negative 7.5% YoY),” he said, adding that the contraction in other indicators such as electricity demand and petroleum consumption has also reduced in the same period.Ind-Ra expects IIP growth of 3% in September from the year before. Eleven of the 23 IIP sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, paper, food and beverages, witnessed a decline. Growth in capital and infrastructure/construction goods declined to a nine-month low of 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively, in August, on an unfavourable base. Intermediate goods sector growth stood at 3.0% year on year in the same period.The high base effect dragged down primary and consumer non-durable goods by 2.6% and 4.5%, respectively. Ind-Ra noted that a sustained decline in consumer non-durables indicated that the stress in rural demand hadn’t bottomed out yet. A steady growth in consumer durables was a positive for consumption demand. Consumer durable goods recorded the highest growth among use-based segments at 5.2% in August."

Prospects of private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, look bright on the back of improved agricultural outlook and rural demand. Sustained buoyancy in services would also support urban demand,"" Das said while announcing MPC's decision to leave the benchmark rates unchanged at 6.5 per cent yet again.Government expenditure of the centre and the states is expected to pick up pace in line with the Budget Estimates, RBI Guv said. Investment activity would benefit from consumer and business optimism, government’s continued thrust on capex and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, he added. The MPC during its August 2024 meeting had forecast India's GDP to grow at 7.2 per cent in FY25.India’s economy grew 8.2% in FY24, continuing to be the fastest-growing major economy in the world. However, its growth slowed to a five-quarter low of 6.7% in the April-June period of FY25 from a year earlier, as agriculture and trade-related services output eased.However, the Economic Survey, released in July 2024 ahead of the full Union Budget announcement forecast a lot more conservative growth rate of 6.5-7 per cent for the ongoing financial year on the back of global uncertainties and various domestic challenges. Brokerage major Nomura, in September, forecast India’s GDP growth to soften to 6.7% in FY25.Catch-up in government spending and rural demand are positives, but softness in consumer discretionary demand, industrial demand and external demand are negatives, it said in a report.Meanwhile, the World Bank last month raised the growth forecast for the Indian economy for FY25 to 7% from 6.6% projected earlier, led by a recovery in the agricultural sector, private consumption and rural demand. Moody's too has upgraded its economic growth forecast for India to 7.2% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025, from earlier estimates of 6.8% and 6.4%, respectively, driven by broad-based growth.GDP is the final value of the goods and services produced within the geographic boundaries of a country during a specified period of time, normally a year. GDP growth rate is an important indicator of the economic performance of a country.It can be measured by three methods, namely:This measures the monetary or market value of all the goods and services produced within the borders of the country. In order to avoid a distorted measure of GDP due to price level changes, GDP at constant prices o real GDP is computed. GDP (as per output method) = Real GDP (GDP at constant prices) – Taxes + Subsidies.This measures the total expenditure incurred by all entities on goods and services within the domestic boundaries of a country. GDP (as per expenditure method) = C + I + G + (X-IM) C: Consumption expenditure, I: Investment expenditure, G: Government spending and (X-IM): Exports minus imports, that is, net exports.It measures the total income earned by the factors of production, that is, labour and capital within the domestic boundaries of a country. GDP (as per income method) = GDP at factor cost + Taxes – Subsidies.In India, contributions to GDP are mainly divided into 3 broad sectors – agriculture and allied services, industry and service sector. In India, GDP is measured as market prices and the base year for computation is 2011-12. GDP at market prices = GDP at factor cost + Indirect Taxes – Subsidies. "

132,India calls for concerted effort to reform international financial architecture for debt free Global South,
133,India is taking millions of its people out of extreme poverty now — this will help to reduce global economic inequality: Justin Wolfers," is professor of public policy and economics at the . Speaking to Srijana Mitra Das, he discusses forms of inequality — and their redressal.A. I would outline my work as arbitrage be -tween several fields. Hence, I work at the intersection between macroeconomics and labour economics. I’m also particularly interested in the intersections of economics with other fields — I study family, marriage and divorce, for instance, which have historically been researched in sociology but we can bring economics to this. I’ve studied elections, usually analysed in political science, but economics can play a role here.Similarly, I study issues in criminal law, normally subjects of legal scholarship, but economics can be applied there too. I find topics economists haven’t devoted much attention to and apply economic methods to these.A. The most immediate one encompasses the tremendous disruptions of global warming and trying to transition to a greener economy. These have huge implications over the next couple of decades. Also, too often in developed economies like the United States, when we say we care about inequality, we are thinking about the problems of the middle class. But if you want to raise total human well-being, the real challenges we face are of economic development or empowering those who simply have too little.The optimist in me sees the world’s greatest anti-poverty program being China’s adoption of markets which took millions out of poverty — today, India’s emerging economy is doing something very similar. Figuring out how to adapt economic models to regions which have seen the most suffering is a key challenge.A. In any country, richer people tend to be happier than poorer people. Some decades ago, it was claimed that people in richer countries were not on average happier than people in poorer countries. My partner and I went through all the available data on this and found it to be overwhelmingly the case that richer countries like the US tend to have populations that are happier than poorer countries. Nations with greater economic development seem to foster more happiness as they offer better healthcare systems, more educational opportunities, the rule of law, the absence of hunger, a social welfare net, etc. If poorer countries could adopt these features, it would likely make their populations happier.It was also claimed earlier that as countries get richer, they don’t necessarily grow happier — but our research has found that as nations became more developed, their happiness levels rose. The one exception has been the US where the pie got larger but so did inequality — the resources of a middle-class family thus didn’t grow considerably, which can correspond to why such families didn’t become much happier.A. In my view, economists can often focus too little on good news. That applies to this area as well. It is very difficult to obtain statistics on the distribution of income around the world. But to the extent that we can make educated guesses, it actually appears global income inequality is declining. Many of the world’s very poor were in China — its growth lifted hundreds of millions to better living circumstances. We are now seeing the same happen with India. The biggest low-income nations have moved closer to becoming middle-income — that itself helps to reduce global income inequality. Regarding inequality within countries, consider the US. Here, income inequality grew for four decades — you could put that on Reagan, globalisation, automation, etc. But enormous government assistance was offered during the pandemic — this really served people at the bottom. Inequality fell — and it has continued to decline in the US. Importantly, this progress has not involved bringing the extreme rich down — for the first time in decades, economic growth lifted the wages of lower-income workers and reduced unemployment.A. No. Historically, economists did think there was a trade-off — more equity was seen to come at the expense of efficiency. But that is not the case. Consider greater commitments made to diversity, inclusion and ending racism, sexism or homophobia — this means an employer will now hire more people based on their skills and abilities rather than their demographic characteristics. The outcomes will be fairer and more efficient.Economic studies in fact suggest a big chunk of our growth over recent decades could be attributable to the fact that our economy now welcomes diverse human beings. An economy which insists, for instance, that women stay at home and only men can work is wasting half its population’s abilities — that is a huge misallocation. Fixing this makes an economy both more equitable and more efficient."
134,"Dear Indian economy, here're five questions for you on a curious case and goldilocks","As India positions itself to become the world’s third-largest economy, certain questions remain, particularly given its vast population and complex political landscape. Issues like inflation, consumer sentiment, job creation, and an election-heavy period are at the forefront, demanding attention.Another pressing concern is the repo rate. With the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting rates, all eyes are on the  (RBI) and its upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. Will the RBI finally cut rates after maintaining status quo for an extended period?A recent UBS report highlights five critical questions that shed light on India's economic trajectory and stability in the coming years.One of the prominent insights from the UBS report revolves around the  pattern observed in India. The consumption behavior, where the affluent segment (people with annual gross income of over US$10,000) has been outperforming while lower-income groups lag behind, is expected to narrow in FY25.According to UBS, signs of fatigue are emerging in the premium consumption segment, while rural and low-income segments may see a cyclical recovery. Factors like , increased social welfare spending, and state government elections are likely to boost demand in these segments.India has enjoyed a 'goldilocks' phase since FY22, marked by strong growth and manageable macroeconomic risks. However, UBS warns that external factors such as a global slowdown, especially in China, could pose challenges. While India’s  is expected to stabilize at 6.8 per cent in FY25, risks remain skewed to the downside, particularly with global economic uncertainties and China’s excess capacity potentially impacting the domestic market. ""Among emerging markets, we continue to expect India to remain one of the fastest growing major economies in 2024-26E. However, we think India is not immune to external risks including a global growth slowdown and China's excess capacity being offloaded on the domestic market,"" UBS said. The report also highlights a significant shift in  patterns. Since the pandemic, many households have moved away from traditional bank deposits in search of higher returns through investments in property, equities, and small savings schemes. This shift has caused bank credit growth (15 per cent YoY as of August 2024) to outpace deposit growth, raising concerns about the sustainability of the current financial dynamics. ""While UBS's India Bank team expects bank credit growth to soften to 12-13% YoY by end-March 2025E, we think bank deposit rates could stay elevated despite expected policy easing, leading to asymmetric monetary transmission.""As inflation begins to moderate,  are rising, sparking questions about the potential impact on India's capex recovery. UBS now forecasts that the RBI could lower repo rates by 75 basis points in this cycle, with rate cuts possibly starting as early as December 2024. "" That said, the timing of India's rate cut cycle will be dependent on domestic growth-inflation dynamics. In our base case, we expect an easing cycle to start from December policy,"" UBS said.: The final point of concern highlighted by UBS is the fiscal profligacy observed in several Indian states, particularly those heading toward elections. The report notes that states have promised increased welfare spending and stimulus, which could drive fiscal deficits higher. UBS estimates the states’ fiscal deficit will rise by 20 basis points in FY25, potentially affecting the overall capex spending and ."

's flash India Composite Purchasing Managers' Index , compiled by S&P Global, slipped to 59.3 this month from August's final reading of 60.7. However, overall activity remained strong, taking the expansionary streak - the 50-mark separating expansion from contraction - to over three years. ""The flash composite PMI in India rose at a slightly slower pace in September, marking the slowest growth observed in 2024,"" noted Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. ""Both the manufacturing and service sectors exhibited similar trends during the month. Nevertheless, the pace of growth remained well above the long-term average."" The dominant services industry's index fell to 58.9 this month from 60.9 in August, its lowest since November, while the manufacturing one cooled to an eight-month low of 56.7 from 57.5. Overall growth was hurt by a softer rise in new business and orders - key gauges for demand - for both services and goods providers in domestic as well as overseas markets. The pace of expansion in  was largely unchanged from August. Highlighting softer demand, companies refrained from fully passing on a slight acceleration in input costs to customers as prices charged were muted compared to last month. Firms noted higher raw materials and electricity prices. ""Input cost inflation rose at a slightly quicker pace in September. Rates of increase in output charges slowed in both sectors, with manufacturers experiencing a larger slowdown, implying a bigger reduction in their margins,"" added Bhandari. That is likely to keep the  on edge as uncertainty over the inflation outlook has increased despite registering below its medium-term target of 4.0% for a second month in August. The next policy meeting will be Oct. 7-9. However, firms continued to hire additional staff this month as the business outlook for the coming 12 months was upbeat, driven by expectations of securing new business. The rise in employment in the services sector was the sharpest since August 2022 and manufacturing jobs increased for a seventh consecutive month, albeit at a slightly easier pace than in August."

This Floor Area Ratio (FAR) can build more than 13,000 extra apartments, potentially resulting in a revenue of Rs 15,000 crore, stated a Times of India news report by Amit Anand Choudhary.Following pressure from the highest court, the Noida and Greater Noida authorities have agreed to the court-appointed receiver and attorney general R Venkataramani's proposal. He is currently overseeing the management of Amrapali after its promoters were ousted for misappropriating homebuyers' funds.The Times of India news report said, that Justices Bela M Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma, sitting on the bench, approved the agreement reached among the parties, with the homebuyers' lawyers Kumar Mihir and Anchit Sripat also consenting to it.The receiver has agreed to pay the total balance amount for the purchasable FAR in two equal instalments. The first instalment is due in Jan 2025 and the second in March 2025. The Greater Noida projects' purchasable FAR has a total cost of Rs 509 crore, with Rs. 115.7 crore already paid. Similarly, Silicon City, the Noida project, has a total purchasable FAR cost of Rs 218.9 crore, which will be paid in two equal instalments.“As per NBCC estimates, 13,250 additional apartments would be constructed in five Amrapali projects in Greater Noida which would fetch Rs 15,000 crore. The amount will enable the company to meet the cost of construction of its pending projects and repay bank debts,” stated the Times of India news report.It was also decided that the NOC will be granted for Amrapali projects, and the Noida and Greater Noida authorities will initiate the verification of drawings submitted by NBCC. Additionally, building plans/layouts for each project will be approved by Noida and Greater Noida authorities within 30 days of receiving these NOCs.Amrapali's chairman and other officials were sent to jail for deceiving thousands of homebuyers, and the top court took control of the company to safeguard the homebuyers' interests. Venkataramani was appointed as receiver to oversee the company's operations. The court issued various instructions to raise funds to revive the company and finish the construction. The court assigned NBCC the task of building 16 projects, which include 46,575 units. Nine projects are in Noida, and the remaining seven projects are in Greater Noida. NBCC estimated that a total of Rs 8,016.7 crore is needed to complete all the projects.The 2019 court ruling found Amrapali Group and its CMD Anil Kumar, along with other directors, accountable for diverting homebuyers' funds for personal enrichment and to grow their business empire. The court revealed that the group established multiple shell companies under the names of office assistants and peons to transfer funds. It also stated that the group had received more money from homebuyers than was spent on construction and land payments. Consequently, the court instructed the Enforcement Directorate to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the group and its officials to uncover fund diversions and identify the beneficiaries."

141,Spot the meta city lights,"A November 2023 Harvard Business Review () piece deals with the rise of a new type of urban conglomeration, meta cities. It elaborates its features: Resurrected residentials During , many predicted the death of global cities because many residents retreated to suburbs and small towns to work remotely. But far from being eclipsed, global cities reinvented themselves with the rise of meta cities - a web of cities that operate as a distinct unit, but are attached to a significant, often global, economic hub. Same differences Communities that make up a  may be in different time zones and non-contiguous locations. Still, they function together as a coherent network with a distinct structure and logic. A meta city combines physical and virtual aggregation, making it possible to occupy more than one space simultaneously. As a result, urban areas within the meta city network can share economic and social functions. Pooling  Since cities are, among other things, essentially labour markets, did this development affect talent pools? Yes, in a positive way, argues the HBR article. As workers spread out from major cities, they were followed by others in their professions, creating ties between hubs and satellite cities.  workers leaving New York for Miami. A Dubai-based company has its Egyptian boss working remotely from Cairo since the pandemic. He makes regular commutes to  and Riyadh to connect with colleagues and meet clients. There are a growing number of similar cases in the region. Tech workers leaving the Bay Area for Austin. Workers in London 'decamping' for Portugal or Spain. Track and go with the flow Mapping these connections and talent flows across a meta city - between hub and satellite locations - provides a powerful new lens to view the evolving economic geography and future of corporate location. So, business leaders need to respond to meta cities. And how they do so will dictate their ability to attract and retain talent.Navigating this shift requires a more sophisticated frame than 'WFO vs WFH'. Companies must change how they think about their HQs, innovation centres, satellite offices and home offices. While global superstar meta city hubs are London and New York, interestingly, four Indian cities figure in the piece, which is based on a study using LinkedIn data (see table): Bengaluru | Global talent hub Leveraged cost and business friendliness. Mumbai | Significant hub Emerging innovation hub. Delhi and  | Regional hub Providing lower-cost sources for talent.Interestingly, Hong Kong's slide down the 'Significant hubs' group underlines how much this global financial hub city has been affected by China imposing a series of restrictions on its businesses and citizenry. As the HBR article notes, 'Not long ago, it was considered a peer of London and New York, as captured in the neologism 'Nylonkong'.'While technology plays a predominant role in the latest slew of talent flows, in the future, it will not be the only catalyst that will spur such movements and reordering of cities. Soon, climate change/risk will set off another such transformation of city boundaries with people migrating to locations that not only provide jobs but health security from climate risks and social safety nets, as Jaya Dhindaw, executive programme director, , and director, WRI India Ross Center, told me. This causal migration is already underway in pollution-affected cities in northern India such as New Delhi/NCR.People and firms are already choosing where to locate not only based on economic or socio-cultural reasons but also according to better air quality, good governance and superior urban development paradigms - quality of life.While most of these shifts are being observed mainly in the formal economy, climate change-induced transformations will impact and see shifts in the informal economy as well, where informal and blue-collar workers may go back to their hometowns, triggering a trend where not only cities but their peripheries and hinterlands will also be part of a new economic geography.If India does see the rise of such meta-cities, what would be the infrastructural requirements for those smaller hubs? Understand them well A national-level mapping of meta-cities or regions can provide a nuanced picture of workforce flows. These would likely be between major metros and upcoming tier-2 and -3 cities and urban areas. Upgrade physical assets Focus on building roads, power, water, as well as networking assets to enable innovation and sustainability (academia-industry collaborations, innovation hubs/zones, etc). While such facilities are primarily located in major cities, smaller urban centres and regions like Surat, Visakhapatnam, Mangalore and Ahmedabad are slowly becoming significant hubs. Balanced development This is an opportunity for India to develop its tier-2 and -3 cities with good, resilient infrastructure facilities, and opportunities for inclusive and better quality of life to achieve regionally balanced economic growth. Climate-resilient Climate risk will bring its own set of imperatives. So, cities and urban areas that step up their game on becoming more equal/equitable and resilient, and put robust adaptation measures in place and a good governance backbone will sustain better in the long run.This new paradigm of corporate location is emerging. It is now for India Inc to be future-ready and take advantage by tapping this meta citizenry.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

143,A move by Hungary could end up costing tourists a lot more to visit Budapest," is ramping up its measures to control overtourism in  by nearly quadrupling the tax on short-term rentals.According to a Bloomberg report, Hungary’s government announced plans to significantly increase the tax on short-term rentals and freeze new licenses in a move aimed at curbing Budapest’s rising housing costs. According to a draft proposal by the Economy Ministry, the monthly tax on rentals like those listed on Airbnb will increase from 38,400 forint to 150,000 forint ($405). Additionally, no new licenses will be issued for such properties in 2025 and 2026.The new measures will apply exclusively to Budapest, where escalating housing costs have been partially driven by the growth of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com. Property prices in the Hungarian capital have almost quadrupled over the last decade, intensifying concerns about affordability for residents.Last month, residents of Budapest’s sixth district, a popular tourist hub, voted in favor of a total ban on short-term rentals starting in 2026. Noise, waste, and higher rental prices have been among the chief complaints from locals. In response to the referendum, the district’s mayor committed to passing new regulations by the end of this year.The government’s restrictions form part of broader efforts to manage overtourism and stabilize the property market in Budapest.Other European countries are also grappling with overtourism and implementing targeted strategies. For instance, Greece plans to introduce cruise ship limitations at major destinations like Santorini starting in 2025 to alleviate environmental and infrastructure stress. The Greek government is also incentivizing long-term rentals by exempting landlords from rental taxes for three years if they switch away from short-term leases. New taxes on accommodation and tourism during peak seasons have also been introduced to support  and address housing challenges.These measures reflect a growing trend across Europe, as popular destinations seek to balance tourism growth with the preservation of local communities and ecosystems. Similar discussions are underway in other cities, such as Amsterdam and Barcelona, to limit tourist numbers and reduce the impact of short-term rentals on housing markets. The goal is to ensure that tourism remains economically beneficial without compromising the quality of life for residents and the sustainability of the environment."

According to the multilateral lender, India's growth rate in FY25 will be the second highest among South Asian nations after Bhutan but it would regain the fastest growing economy tag in the next fiscal year with 6.7% growth.Bhutan's economy is expected to grow 7.2% in fiscal 2024-25 (July-June). The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday retained its real GDP forecast at 7.2% for FY25.""Investment growth is expected to moderate from a high base,"" the World Bank said in its October South Asia Development Update, Women, Jobs and Growth.The estimate aligns with India's pre-pandemic (FY17-19) average growth rate and outpaces most other major emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs).While the  rate remains unchanged from the World Bank's September update, it has increased by 0.4 percentage point from the April forecast of 6.6%.The multilateral lender also upgraded the economic outlook for all South Asian countries, except for Bangladesh and the Maldives. South Asia's output is expected to grow by 6.2% in 2025, fuelled by strong private consumption in India, and increased tourism and hydropower exports in Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.The World Bank forecast India's fiscal deficit to reduce by 0.7 percentage point of GDP in 2024-25, reaching 7.5% of GDP due to ""higher revenues from improved compliance with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and a broadening of the personal income tax base"". India is likely to attract global investors ""seeking locations with low geopolitical risks and strong economic fundamentals,"" it said. "

148,Builder fined for charging parking space separately over the flat price; Know what your legal rights are,"When you invest a substantial portion of your savings to buy your dream home, you expect the builder to strictly adhere to the law and not deceive you into paying extra money. Unfortunately, an 81-year-old retired Major of the Indian Army faced misfortune when he bought a residence with the 3 BHK at Hill View Garden Housing Complex in Rajasthan. In this instance, the developer sold him the  as a separate unit, despite the  law prohibiting this practice and the homebuyer's agreement stating otherwise.The retired Major took action against the builder for various violations, including the illegal sale of parking spaces and the delay in obtaining an occupation certificate. Initially filing a case in the State Consumer Commission, the dispute eventually escalated to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) after a long legal battle spanning seven years. The NCDRC found the promoter guilty of breaching both the law and the homebuyer's agreement and consequently supported the claim for compensation.According to the order of the NCDRC, here are some important facts of the case: Lawyers representing the retired Major said before NCDRC, ""It is submitted that despite the settled position that builder/developer/promoter cannot sell parking areas as independent unit as the same is extended as common areas and facilities for the Owners, the builder contrary to the settled position of law and in contravention of clause 3 of the flat buyer's agreement forming part of the proceeding, charged Rs 50,000/- towards covered car parking from the complainant, which amounts to unfair trade practice.""After a thorough evaluation of the case, NCDRC said, ""The complainant's assertion regarding charging of Rs 50,000/- towards covered parking area is found to be valid. Clause 1.2 of the buyers' agreement specifies that the sale price includes the exclusive right to use open/covered car parking. Consequently, the Rs 50,000/- charge for the parking space is deemed arbitrary and a breach of contract. Therefore, this amount shall be refunded to the complainant."" NCDRC, in its order dated September 20, 2024, said, ""The builder is directed to refund an amount of Rs 50,000/- to the complainant charged in lieu of covered parking area with interest at the rate of 6% p.a. from the date of deposit till its realisation.""If Trehan Home Developers decide to pay the compensation, the amount comes to Rs 50,000+50,000*6%*18 years= Rs 50,000+54,000= Rs 1,04,000.An email was sent to Trehan Home Developers on October 8, 2024, but no response was received until the time of publishing.Ashish Jain, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas says that there are two separate aspects to note in this case:1. 's clause 1.2.2. Rajasthan Apartment Ownership Act, 2015.Sumant Nayak, Senior Partner, Desai & Diwanji agrees with Jain and says that the homebuyer's agreement is sacrosanct and cannot be altered once agreed and signed. ""It is a settled position of law that the covenants of the builder buyer agreement (BBA) are sacrosanct and the breakup of the total price of the apartment shall include the charges towards earmarked parking spaces. Additionally, the courts vide a catena of judgments have held that the developer shall be liable to compensate the buyer in cases where the BBA is ambiguous and later on the developer attempts to separately charge the buyer for facilities such as car parking. Therefore, it is clear that a BBA entered into between the parties is pivotal and must capture succinctly all kinds of charges.""According to Sadhav Mishra, Partner and Head of Real Estate, SNG & Partners, Advocates & Solicitors, ""Prior to enactment of RERA/MahaRERA, the sale of car parking (stilt/open) by the builder was prohibited in view of the landmark judgment by the hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Nihalchand Laloochand Pvt. Ltd. Vs Panchali CHS Ltd. whereby the hon'ble court interalia held that stilt/open car parking space of a building is nothing but a part of common areas and hence only a flat within the meaning of section 2 (a-1) of Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act, (MOFA) can be sold along with garage,"" says Mishra.Kunal Sharma, Partner, Singhania & Co says, ""while builders can include parking spaces in the sale of flats, they cannot sell them separately. The value of the parking space should be incorporated into the overall flat price. Additionally, the sale agreement must clearly outline the details of the parking space. Failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in penalties and legal disputes.""""The Supreme Court held that builders cannot sell parking spaces separately as they are part of the “common areas” defined under Section 2(n) of the  Act. This section includes open parking areas, basements, and other shared spaces as common  for all allottees. The Court concluded that such spaces must be available for the common use of residents without extra charges, and the cost for these common areas and facilities should be proportionately included in the flat’s price. In another ruling, the Apex court, emphasized that once the original plan is approved by the competent authority, the areas of residential units and common spaces are fixed. Any change in the super area must correspond to changes in the flat area, common buildings, or the total project area,"" says Sharma.According to Nishant Datta, Advocate, Delhi High Court, ""In this case cited above the builder demanded additional money for parking space, which has been held to be illegal through a series of long standing judicial pronouncements and there has not been any diversion of opinions or conflict of judgements also. The Supreme Court of India upheld the 2011 Bombay High Court verdict in the Nahalchand Laloochand Pvt Ltd vs. Panchali Cooperative Housing Society case. Initially, builders were permitted to sell parking spaces as independent units to outsiders, but this led to objections from society residents. The Supreme Court’s decision reaffirmed that parking spaces are common facilities provided by society and cannot be sold separately. Similarly the Supreme Court in the Nahalchand Laloochand Pvt Ltd vs Panchali Co-operative Housng Society Ltd, held that builders or promoters cannot sell parking areas as independent units or flats. These are to be extended as common areas and facilities.""( Originally published on Oct 21, 2024 )"
149,"We are implementing a range of initiatives for sustainable coffee production: Vinay Nair, Costa Coffee","Even as  are rising, India’s coffee industry has an opportunity to innovate and diversify its offerings, says , General Manager, India & Emerging Markets, . Despite the ongoing price fluctuations, the enthusiasm for coffee, especially among younger generations, ensures that demand remains robust, he says.In an interaction with ET Digital, Nair recognises the need to address climate change. He says the company is involved in  and responsible sourcing, which helps it support biodiversity and enhance the livelihood of coffee-growing communities. Edited excerpts: Rising global coffee prices present both challenges and opportunities for the industry. India's coffee industry is thriving and is highly respected worldwide, but we do not have control over global pricing dynamics. However, we have observed that despite the fluctuations, the growing enthusiasm for coffee, especially among younger generations, ensures that demand remains robust. At Costa Coffee, this shift provides an exciting opportunity for us to innovate and diversify our offerings. We are enhancing our partnerships with local farmers and focusing on cost-effective, environmentally friendly sourcing methods.   The pandemic inadvertently provided a boost to the coffee industry by simply shifting how and where people enjoy their coffee. Reflecting a change in consumer habits, coffee consumption has grown steadily as people increasingly seek comfort and enjoyment in their daily routines. However, the enduring aspiration for the traditional coffee shop experience remained strong, as evidenced by the resurgence of visits to coffee shops as restrictions eased. This trend has developed a renewed interest in coffee culture that embodies inclusivity and self-expression, creating environments where diverse communities can unite and share their stories. In India, this trend has been especially pronounced celebrating unique preferences and identities of each individual. Globally, flavour trends continue to disrupt the market, and we have observed that customers, especially Gen Z, like to add a flavour syrup to their hot beverage when given a chance. The most popular flavours are caramel, vanilla and hazelnut. However, the preference for customisation through digital ordering screens can be attributed to digital interfaces providing a more detailed and interactive experience. It allows customers to explore a wide range of options and make precise adjustments to their coffee preferences. This level of personalisation is often less feasible in a traditional counter setting. Additionally, digital platforms offer a degree of privacy and control, enabling customers to experiment with various combinations with ease. Recognising the need to address climate change, Costa Coffee is implementing a range of initiatives to ensure sustainable coffee production. We collaborate with Rainforest Alliance to advance sustainable farming practices and responsible sourcing, thereby supporting biodiversity and enhancing the livelihood of coffee-growing communities. Through the Costa Foundation, we invest in education and infrastructure projects in these regions, significantly improving farmers’ livelihood. These comprehensive efforts are integral to maintaining a resilient and sustainable coffee supply chain. We are delighted to embark on a historic journey as the ‘official coffee partner’ for the , a first-of-its-kind partnership that underscores our dedication to excellence and innovation. Our vision is to deliver outstanding coffee experiences to athletes and fans while highlighting the expertise of our baristas, including our talented team from India. Every cup of coffee we serve tells a story — the story of hard work, continuous training and elevating the skills. Each beverage is a testament of devotion to perfecting their craft. By investing in their growth and providing them with experiences of a lifetime, we reaffirm our culture of fostering excellence and inclusivity. Costa Coffee is actively expanding its footprint with a clear focus on deepening and broadening its presence on the back of innovation. We have already opened 190 stores in India, and we will continue to leverage the right mix of retail and hospitality to build on that momentum. With a focus on both existing markets and new urban centres, our expansion strategy includes increasing our presence in top cities across the country. Airports, highways, commercial establishments and healthcare facilities continue to be our priority to capture a diverse range of consumer needs. ( Originally published on Aug 13, 2024 )"
150,Urbanisation an opportunity to build modern cities: Amitabh Kant,"India's rapid  will see 500 million people moving into cities over the next four to five decades, the country's G20 Sherpa  said, emphasising the need for pushing .Speaking at an event hosted by BITS Design School, Mumbai, and LOPEZ Design on Monday, he said, ""50% of India for 2070 is still to be built, so we will see 500 million Indians getting into the process of urbanisation in the next four to five decades."" ""This unprecedented urbanisation presents a unique opportunity for India to build cities that are not only modern but also equitable and sustainable."" Underscored the nation's economic trajectory, Kant said, ""In three years, India will overtake Japan and Germany to become the third largest economy, and we are aiming to be a $30-trillion economy by 2047. That means we will grow eight times bigger by 2047.""""The western part of the world is aging, China is aging. India is very young and will remain young till 2047. Our average age will still be just 35 in 2047,"" he said, reiterating India's  compared to other global powers.Kant warned against the perils of unplanned urbanisation, referencing mistakes made by other nations, particularly in prioritising vehicle-centric infrastructure over . ""America, for instance, their car companies actually bought over the railway companies and destroyed them,"" he said. He advocated for a human-centric approach to urban design, promoting walkable cities, cycling paths, and efficient public transit."
151,"Why droughts, not economic struggles, could be the new reason for urban migration","As the climate continues to warm and environmental conditions worsen, droughts are becoming a critical factor driving migration, according to a comprehensive study that examined  trends in 72 countries over the span of five decades. Traditionally, migration—both within and across national borders—has been attributed to economic or conflict-related reasons. However, in recent years, , especially droughts, have emerged as a significant cause of displacement.The research, published in the journal , reveals that prolonged dry spells and arid conditions accelerate internal migration, with people moving away from rural regions towards cities. The study, led by , Director of the  at Bocconi University, Italy, used census-based data to analyze 107,840 migration flows between 1960 and 2016. The findings show that drought and aridity have a substantial impact on internal migration, particularly in the hyper-arid and arid regions of Southern Europe, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America.The hardest-hit areas, according to the study, are rural regions heavily reliant on agriculture. As soils dry up and water supplies diminish, agricultural productivity declines, directly affecting the livelihoods of those dependent on farming. ""In places where farming is the main source of income, drying soils and dwindling water supplies directly translate into lost livelihoods, thereby driving people towards urban areas,"" the researchers noted in the study.This movement from rural to urban areas is often viewed as the ""least bad option"" for many individuals facing environmental pressures, according to Marco Percoco. Drought conditions, particularly in agricultural communities, leave residents with little choice but to relocate in search of better living conditions. The researchers highlighted that the impact of climate change is most severe in rural areas, where people rely on farming and natural resources for survival.The study suggests that migration to urban centers serves as a coping mechanism for families in rural areas that can no longer sustain their traditional way of life. Urban areas, though perceived as offering more stable opportunities, are not without their challenges. The influx of migrants from rural areas places additional strain on already stressed urban infrastructures, from housing and healthcare to education and employment opportunities.""Urban areas, therefore, become magnets for people fleeing rural ones,"" the study noted, adding that the increasing migration to cities is reshaping urban landscapes. This trend is already visible in regions such as South Asia and Africa, where rural populations are moving to cities at an unprecedented rate.The researchers emphasize the need for a more comprehensive approach to address climate-induced migration. Rather than treating migration solely as a reaction to worsening environmental conditions, policies should focus on mitigating the root causes of displacement. The study calls for strategies aimed at stabilizing rural populations and reducing the need for migration.According to the authors, better water management, agricultural innovations, and social safety nets are key to helping rural communities adapt to the changing climate. These measures would allow people to continue their livelihoods without being forced to leave their homes. ""We need policies that help rural communities adapt to climate change in place, thereby possibly reducing the need for migration in the first place,"" the study stated.In addition to addressing the issues in rural areas, the study stresses the importance of improving support systems in urban centers to handle the rising number of migrants. Without adequate infrastructure and resources, cities could struggle to meet the growing needs of displaced populations, further exacerbating social and economic challenges. The researchers advocate for proactive policies that focus on urban development and resource management to accommodate the needs of new arrivals while ensuring sustainable urban growth.As droughts intensify and more people migrate to urban areas, it is clear that the effects of climate change are reshaping global migration patterns. The study’s findings underscore the urgency of developing long-term strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change on vulnerable populations and ensure that both rural and urban areas are equipped to handle these shifts."

154,US housing crisis: Why is America facing shortage of homes and will this crunch revive inflation?,"A massive housing crisis in the United States is brewing mostly centered around the unavailability of homes in the largest metros of the country. The shortage of homes in metropolitan regions clearly shows the true picture of a housing crunch in the US, which is a big problem for the federal administration to address in the coming months. The pandemic, inflation and elevated interest rates have all contributed to the growing housing crisis in the US. A number of factors such as rising costs of materials, supply-chain issues, labour shortages stemming from Covid-19 pandemic have negatively impacted the housing supply in the US, according to a report in the Bankrate. Though the problem persisted before the pandemic gripped the world, the US has failed to cope the housing demands in line with the continually rising population, the report mentioned.Another contributing factor that shoots up the housing crisis in the US is the activity of institutional investor, who buy up  to flip or rent out for profit, the report said. Large investors purchased 14.8 percent of homes on the market in the first quarter of 2024 — a record-high percentage, according to a report from Realtor.com, and that eventually removes those units from the pool of availability for individual buyers.A new report has also emerged which throws light on how billionaire investors are disrupting the US housing market. According to inequality.org, predatory billionaire investors have bought up an unprecedented share of single-family homes, apartment buildings, and mobile home parks to extract more rents from already economically squeezed residents. As per the report, wealthy investors are acquiring property and holding units vacant.The overall gauge, which is known as the CPI for all urban consumers, draws from a sample that covers over 90% of the US population and comprises areas with at least 10,000 people. Since the measure is basedon the average consumer, someone whose medical care comprises a larger-than-typical share of their expenses may experience a different rate of inflation than the norm, or a household that uses solar energyrather than fuel, reported Bloomberg. The effects of the ripples of the Great Recession, which shook the economy of America in 2007-2008, are still felt today. The  had a severe impact on housing inventory. On the top of it, the high-interest-rate environment of the past few years has also complicated the matters of housing shortage in the US. “When rates hit 6 percent, we saw many aspiring homebuyers put their search on hold temporarily,” Shmuel Shayowitz, president and chief lending officer of mortgage lender Approved Funding told Bankrate. “At 7 percent, we saw a bigger tipping point where people exited the market en masse.”There are signs of more supply entering the market, but it's not enough to meet high demand. As a result,  predicts home prices will continue to rise. The current housing crunch in the US is not going anytime soon. While lowering interest rates may help, but that alone won't help much to solve this complex problem. ”It could take a while for the US to recover from the current housing shortage,” says Roberts. “Houses take time and capital to build, plus there are other factors at play. Unfortunately, there is no short-term solution.”The larger question which remains is: Will  revive inflation? Mortgage giant Freddie Mac in its latest housing market report stated ""while inflationary pressures have been declining, there are potential upside risks to inflation.""“One area where inflation could resurge is housing inflation in an environment where the fundamental mismatch of supply and demand remains a major challenge for the housing market,"" the report warned. According to a report in the Fortune, increase in inflation could reduce expectations of more relief from the Fed. Recent consumer price data showed that inflation was higher than expected last month, making another substantial rate cut unlikely. Housing costs are a significant part of inflation readings, so any upward pressure in this area could have a big impact on overall data.As the housing crisis continues, many Americans feel trapped. Research by Edelman Financial Engines shows that over a third of homeowners feel stuck in their homes and unable to move, rising to nearly 50% among those under 50"
155,India sees 415 million people coming out of poverty in 15 years: United Nations,"According to the , India has witnessed a remarkable achievement in poverty reduction, with a staggering 415 million individuals transitioning out of poverty within a relatively short span of 15 years, from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021. This was highlighted in the latest update of the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which was jointly released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford.The report showed that 25 countries, including India, managed to halve their global MPI values within a 15-year timeframe, illustrating the possibility of rapid progress. Among the countries that achieved this feat are Cambodia, China, Congo, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Serbia, and Vietnam.In April, India surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation, with a population of 1.4286 billion people, according to UN data.""Notably, India saw a remarkable reduction in poverty, with 415 million people exiting poverty within a span of just 15 years (2005/6-19/21),"" the report said.While this report demonstrates the feasibility of poverty reduction, it also acknowledged the challenges posed by the lack of comprehensive data during the COVID-19 pandemic, making it difficult to assess immediate prospects. In the case of India, the incidence of poverty decreased from 55.1 percent in 2005/2006 to 16.4 percent in 2019/2021, signifying that 415 million people moved out of poverty during this period.In 2005/2006, approximately 645 million individuals in India were experiencing multidimensional poverty. This number declined to around 370 million in 2015/2016 and further dropped to 230 million in 2019/2021, reflecting a substantial reduction in poverty levels. The report noted that deprivation in all indicators declined in India, and ""the poorest states and groups, including children and people in disadvantaged caste groups, had the fastest absolute progress.""  According to the report, people who are multidimensionally poor and deprived under the nutrition indicator in India declined from 44.3 per cent in 2005/2006 to 11.8 per cent in 2019/2021, and child mortality fell from 4.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent.  Those who are poor and deprived of cooking fuel fell from 52.9 per cent to 13.9 per cent, and those deprived of sanitation fell from 50.4 per cent in 2005/2006 to 11.3 per cent in 2019/2021, according to the report.  In the drinking water indicator, the percentage of people who are multidimensionally poor and deprived fell from 16.4 to 2.7 during the period, electricity (from 29 per cent to 2.1 per cent) and housing from 44.9 per cent to 13.6 per cent.  The report said that countries with different incidences of poverty also halved their global MPI value.  While 17 countries that did so had an incidence under 25 per cent in the first period, India and Congo had a starting incidence above 50 per cent.  India was among the 19 countries that halved their global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value during one period - for India it was 2005/2006-2015/2016.  According to the 2023 release, 1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people (just over 18 per cent) live in acute multidimensional poverty across 110 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (534 million) and South Asia (389 million) are home to approximately five out of every six poor people.  Nearly two-thirds of all poor people (730 million people) live in middle-income countries, making action in these countries vital for reducing global poverty. Although low-income countries constitute only 10 per cent of the population included in the MPI, these are where 35 per cent of all poor people reside.  Children under the age of 18 account for half of MPI-poor people (566 million). The poverty rate among children is 27.7 per cent, while among adults, it is 13.4 per cent. Poverty predominantly affects rural areas, with 84 per cent of all poor people living in rural areas. Rural areas are poorer than urban areas across all regions of the world.  Countries halved their MPI in periods as short as four to 12 years, demonstrating the feasibility of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of halving poverty according to national definitions within 15 years.  Thus, it is crucial to consider context-specific multidimensional poverty indices that reflect national definitions of poverty since the global MPI assesses multidimensional poverty with the same methodology, the report said.  The agencies, however, added that despite these encouraging trends, the lack of post-pandemic data for most of the 110 countries covered by the global MPI restricts the understanding of the pandemic's effects on poverty.  ""As we reach the mid-point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we can clearly see that there was steady progress in multidimensional poverty reduction before the pandemic,"" the Director of the Human Development Report Office, Pedro Conceicao, said.  ""However, the negative impacts of the pandemic in dimensions such as education are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. It is imperative that we intensify efforts to comprehend the dimensions most negatively affected, necessitating strengthened data collection and policy efforts to get poverty reduction back on track,"" Conceicao added.  A press release issued by the UNDP said that judging from the few countries where data were solely collected in 2021 or 2022 - Mexico, Madagascar, Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria - momentum on poverty reduction may have persisted during the pandemic.  Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria showed significant reductions in their most recent periods, offering hope that progress is still possible. In Cambodia, the most encouraging case among these, the incidence of poverty fell from 36.7 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the number of poor people halved, from 5.6 million to 2.8 million, all within 7.5 years, including the pandemic years (2014-2021/22).  However, the full impacts globally remain to be measured, it said.  With a renewed emphasis on data collection, ""we need to broaden the picture to include the impacts of the pandemic on children,"" the press release said.  ""In over half the countries covered, there was either no statistically significant reduction in child poverty or the MPI value fell more slowly among children than among adults during at least one period. This suggests that child poverty will continue to be a pressing issue, particularly in relation to school attendance and undernutrition,"" it said.  Director of OPHI at the University of Oxford, Sabina Alkire, said the scarcity of data on multidimensional poverty is hard to comprehend, let alone justify.  ""The world is reeling under a data deluge and gearing up for the next era of digital growth. Yet we do not have a post-pandemic line of sight for 1 billion of the 1.1 billion poor people,"" Alkire said.  ""This problem is eminently solvable - data on multidimensional poverty are faster to gather than most realise - requiring just 5 per cent of questions in the surveys we use. We call on funders and data scientists to make a breakthrough on poverty data, so the interconnected deprivations that strike poor people in real-time can be tracked - and intercepted,"" she added.  The global MPI monitors poverty reduction and informs policy, showing how people experience poverty in different aspects of their daily lives - from access to education and health to living standards such as housing, drinking water, sanitation, and electricity.  The MPI as a poverty index can be pictured as a stacked tower of the interlinked deprivations experienced by poor individuals, with the aim of eliminating these deprivations."

163,The quiet revolution: How electric vehicles are redefining urban soundscapes,"According to March 6, 2023 stats, India had 21.7 lakh  () on the road out of total 33.8crore vehicles. This makes up 0.6% of the total count. EVs are innovating a , transformingthe auditory landscape of urban areas tremendously. This transformation offers not only environmentalhealth improvement thanks to reduced emissions but also restructuring the daily soundscape, which in turnpromotes a calmer and more wholesome city atmosphere.The urban redesign includes the enhancement of , ideally with the introduction ofquieter electric vehicles.Planners are seeking to capitalize on the noise-reduction features that EVs boast and are integrating newpublic spaces with elements like abundant greenery designs— a feature less effective amid traffic noise.With technological development, consumers gain confidence and willingness to purchase EVThe overall EV penetration for India is anticipated to grow 8 times to reach 40%+ the penetration in themobility sector by 2030. Upgrading the EV technology by designing longer-lasting batteries, betterperforming motors and the design of the vehicles are helping the  to attract consumers and thebusiness.Fossil fuel-powered vehicles, including internal combustion engines, mostly add to the complexity of thenoise in modern cities. Thus, such a reduction in  is crucially needed because chronic highnoise levels tend to promote stress, high blood pressure, and the risk of cardiac issues. Therefore, EVscontribute significantly to a less harmful .The quietness of EVs enhances safety for pedestrians and cyclists by making crucial sounds like horns andemergency sirens more audible. This is critical in a bustling city environment where these audio cues areinstrumental for road safety. Nonetheless, a silent EV can of course also present a risk to pedestrians astheir lack of engine noise may prevent their detection. As a solution to this, the EVs are installed with asound system thus maintaining safety amid tranquility.Quieter EVs not only provide benefits to people but also to urban wildlife, birds in particular, who depend onsound signals to communicate with fellow members. A transportation system with over-use of loud noisescan disturb normal behavioral patterns, thereby causing imbalance and reducing the survival rate. Bydecreasing noise pollution and building healthier ecosystems, EVs may play their part in preserving urbanbiodiversity.Quiet and calm streets act as record-breakers in bringing closer social relationships in the urban areas.Reduction in noise level would create an atmosphere encouraging people to come out of the home thusresulting in more . The rightful atmosphere in turn provides a base for outdoor cafes,increased pedestrian zones and public meeting places which in turn help community bonds and socialcohesion.Adoption of EVs is crucial for urban regions, in pace with national and world plans to curb GHG emissionsand fight climate change. EVs contribute not only to environmental preservation but also add positiveinfluence to the quality of urban life, which subsequently constitutes sustainable urban planning.EVs are no longer an alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles, they are drivers of urban transformation withtheir role being that of a moving gate. They redefine not just our driving habits but are silently driving arevolution towards a sustainable future. Urban planning is implemented with EVs in mind and is thus a coremeasure of the transition to even more sustainable and harmonious urban living.(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

165,US housing crisis worsens as home sales fall to lowest level since 2010. When will this crunch end?,"The United States is facing a significant housing crisis and it is only getting worsened. The housing crunch in US marked by a shortage of homes, particularly in metropolitan areas, has taken a toll on the savings of Americans. This issue has become increasingly urgent for the federal administration to address. Contributing factors include the pandemic, inflation, and elevated interest rates. While the housing problem existed before the pandemic, the US has struggled to meet housing demand in line with population growth. The  has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows.Amid the deepening housing crisis, US existing home sales dropped to a 14-year low in September, weighed down by higher mortgage rates and house prices, reported news agency Reuters. The sale of previously owned homes unexpectedly fell last month, slowing to a pace not seen since 2010. Existing home sales fell 1% last month, from August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.84 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. The housing market in the US has struggled to improve after being knocked down by a resurgence in mortgage rates in the spring. This decline to a multi-year low shows that buyers have now chosen to wait for home borrowing costs to go down, as typically happens when the Federal Reserve eases interest rates. Sales fell 3.5% compared with September last year. The latest home sales were short of the 3.9 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet, reported The New York Post.Despite the slower sales pace, home prices increased on an annual basis for the 15th consecutive month. At the same time, the median sales price of existing homes jumped 3% from last September to $404,500, marking the 15th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases, the NAR said.Reuters reported that supply has improved. But entry-level homes remain scarce in most regions of the country, keeping home prices at levels that are unaffordable for most first-time buyers.""It will take more rate cuts and more options to bring buyers back,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.The inventory of unsold existing homes, which includes single-family homes, town houses and condominiums, rose by 1.5% in September from the prior month to 1.39 million, according to Fox business. ""Home sales have been essentially stuck at around a four-million-unit pace for the past 12 months, but factors usually associated with higher home sales are developing,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. ""There are more inventory choices for consumers, lower mortgage rates than a year ago and continued job additions to the economy.""Yun added, ""Perhaps, some consumers are hesitating about moving forward with a major expenditure like purchasing a home before the upcoming election.""""Rising mortgage rates and high home prices are ganging up on would-be homebuyers who struggle to find homes they can afford,"" Holden Lewis, a home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet told Fox Business. Home resales decreased 3.5% on a year-on-year basis in September. Sales fell 1.7% in the South, with some of the decline attributed to weakness in Florida following the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. Sales in the state could remain depressed after it was slammed by Hurricane Milton weeks later.The NAR speculated that the upcoming November 5 U.S. presidential election could be making prospective homeowners hesitant to commit themselves. There is, however, no hard evidence that the election is influencing buying decisions.According to experts, the current housing crunch is not going anytime soon. While lowering interest rates may help but that alone wont help solve the problem, they added. Experts said that while inflationary pressures are declining, there are potential upside risks to inflation. One area where inflation could re-surge is housing inflation and this could make it difficult for Fed to cut rates, they said. "
166,Thirst Trap: Water sustainability issues loom over India's booming data centre industry,"The data on  in India converges on one point: there is no stopping its . This January,  signed an agreement with the Maharashtra government for a Rs 50,000 crore investment to set up a 1 gigawatt (GW) data centre, apart from Rs 5,000 crore for a 100 megawatt (MW) data centre in Telangana. Tech giant Meta, ET reported in April, would open its first data centre in India on a 10-acre campus in Chennai. Meanwhile, Google’s parent company Alphabet is reported to be in talks for its first captive data centre in India in Navi Mumbai. A report by ratings agency CareEdge in May estimates that India would double its data centre  from under 1 GW now to 2 GW by 2026, while another by Cushman & Wakefield in June forecasts that by 2028, India will have thrice the installed capacity, at 3.29 GW.India is still a minnow compared with US, the market leader in data centres. Northern Virginia alone has a capacity of over 8 GW, says , head–data centre advisory team (Asia Pacific), Cushman & Wakefield. But as data centres in India grow in number and capacity, it is likely that it will have to grapple with an important question: will its cities, which are already water-stressed, be able to support this scorching pace of growth of a sector considered to be water-guzzling?Across the world, it’s a challenge playing out in regions facing a  shortage, exacerbated by drought, resulting in friction with local communities in areas like Arizona in the US and Santiago in Chile. Experts in water conservation say this is a question India’s policymakers might want to address early on, with the sector poised for exponential growth.  Data centres are variously described as the beating heart of the , its reservoir and backbone. Apart from housing an organisation’s IT applications and services, it is also where all the data we generate when we use various applications, whether making a digital payment or binge-watching a show, are stored and processed.“Over the last 10-20 years, colocation firms, which are service providers, have come up, renting out rack space (in data centres), similar to  renting out cubicles,” says Dahiya. Then there are the hyperscalers, or the large cloud data centres, operated by the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The rise of generative AI is further supercharging the growth of the segment. India may have been late to the data centre party but it’s now catching up, thanks to a host of catalysts—from the increasing amount of data consumed by India’s estimated 800 million internet users to growing digitisation across the board to recent legislation in the form of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act and the requirement to store and process data locally. “At one point, countries which had good airports and ports prospered. In today’s digital economy, countries which have the right data centre infrastructure—which will be the heart of the digital economy—will gain from that economically,” says Vipin Jain, president– datacentre operations, CtrlS Datacenters, which is planning to increase capacity 2-2.5 times in the next three years.   For this segment in a hurry, the question of  water use arises due to two reasons: one, its need, typically, for large quantities of water for cooling (apart from as a source of power) because of the heat generated in its functioning. It is critical for a data centre to maintain a temperature of around 220 C. “Data centres consume significant amounts of water for cooling purposes. Systems like evaporative cooling and chiller plants require continuous water supply to maintain optimal server temperatures,” says Praveen Ramamurthy, chair, Interdisciplinary Centre for Water Research, Indian Institute of Science (IISc). In water-based chillers, the conventional mode of cooling, water is cooled in a central chiller and circulated through pipes and coils to cool the air in the data centre.   Two, data centres in India are located in some of its biggest cities, most of which already face water supply issues, as this summer underlined. Over half the data centres are located in Mumbai and 15-18% in Chennai due to the proximity to submarine cable connectivity. Mumbai also has a significant presence of banking and finance sectors that are important customers of data centres. In a 2021 report by industry body Nasscom, titled, “India: The Next Data Center Hub”, water shortage was cited as a high-risk factor for data centres in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi, and moderate-to-high risk for Mumbai.The amount of water a data centre needs for cooling depends on the cooling technology used, its location, efficiency measures and capacity. A commonly cited figure from a 2021 study published in Nature estimated that a 1 MW data centre that reduces air temperature by cooling water “can use around 25.5 million litres of water per year”, or 68,500 litres a day. This would mean a 20 MW data centre would need about 1.37 million litres a day if it uses a water-intensive cooling solution. Meanwhile, daily water supply is just over 1,000 million litres in Chennai, about 1,500 million litres in Bengaluru and close to 3,000 million litres in Mumbai, with demand pegged higher. “India’s water issues arise from the fact that we have 18% of global population but only 4% of water resources,” says Sahana Goswami, senior manager–water resilience team, WRI India, adding that about 80% of water we use is in the agriculture sector. In the case of water use by data centres, it will be better to pre-empt a crisis, she says. Adding to the issue is the fact that there’s no national policy on water use by data centres. The only mention of water in a 2020 draft national policy is a line saying that states shall be encouraged to set up data centre parks with necessary infrastructure, including availability of water. “It’s very important we get good policy around data centres because it’s critical infrastructure,” says Goswami.   Stakeholders say data centres in India have factored in the shortage of water in Indian cities. For instance, multinational digital infrastructure company Equinix, which entered the Indian market in 2020, uses only air-cooled chillers here instead of water-cooled chillers. “We decided to use air-cooled chillers because India has had years of drought and if we cannot get water, data centres face the risk of not being able to operate at all. Our customers cannot run that risk,” says Manoj Paul, MD, Equinix India. CtrlS says it is also increasingly using air-cooled chillers. “The data centre industry in India has taken into account the fact that water will be scarce. Considering this, data centers here are moving in the direction of air-cooled chillers,” says Jain.  Web , which has announced facilities in Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra in a joint venture with global operator Iron Mountain, also says it uses cooling solutions that minimise water consumption. “Our data centres use air-cooled chillers for cooling, which sustain water utilisation over a longer period of time,” says Nikhil Rathi, founder and CEO, Web Werks-Iron Mountain Data Centers. Anand Kulkarni, director, CRISIL Ratings, says its initial analysis suggests that the type of data centres in India “don’t use much water-cooled chillers, hence the use of water is limited”. To cut down on the use of water and power for cooling and increase efficiency, companies globally are exploring different technologies, such as liquid immersion cooling. Here, the server is dipped in a tank filled with a dielectric coolant (which does not conduct electricity) that absorbs and dissipates the heat generated. With increased deployment of AI, where processing requirements are much higher and the heat load will proportionally go up, the use case for liquid cooling would strengthen. However, Sachin Bhalla, VP–secure power, Greater India, Schneider Electric, which provides cooling solutions to data centres, says the switch to liquid cooling would not be simple. “If you want to bring about liquid cooling, you have to change the type of servers you use. The end customer who is actually taking up data centres has to take the call whether they want to opt for it and order the hardware and advise the data centre builder accordingly.” Still, companies are experimenting. “Immersion cooling is the most efficient but also the most difficult to implement. There are risks because you are talking of liquid in the data hall. But we are trying it out in 100 centres across the globe,” says Paul. “We have started designing our new data centres, which can be fully cooled with liquid cooling. We are also working on liquid cooling solutions with some of our existing clients,” says Jain. Microsoft, which has three data centres in India, did not comment specifically on water use when contacted, only saying, “Microsoft started its data centre journey in India in 2015 and has three data centres, one each in Mumbai, Pune, and Chennai. It plans to open a fourth in Hyderabad that is expected to be operational by 2025.” ” In its 2024 environmental sustainability report, the company said one area where it was not on track was in “Reducing water use and replenishing more water than we consume in our datacenter operations”. But the report also mentioned that its new data centres are “designed and optimized to support AI workloads and will consume zero water for cooling”.  “Reducing water use and replenishing more water than we consume in our datacenter operations”. But the report also mentioned that its new data centres are “designed and optimized to support AI workloads and will consume zero water for cooling”. While the expansion of data centres in India brings significant technological and economic benefits, it is crucial to balance this growth with sustainable water management practices, says Ramamurthy. Locating data centres in areas with ample water supply or access to non-potable water sources, developing and enforcing regulations to ensure sustainable water usage practices, including mandatory recycling and limits on groundwater extraction, he says, can help manage the water footprint of data centres and alleviate any pressure on water-stressed cities.( Originally published on Jul 13, 2024 )"

171,China's GDP growth dips: Where is its economy headed?,"China's GDP grew by 4.7 per cent in the second quarter compared to the previous year, which was below expectations of a 5.1 per cent increase. The growth rate marked a  from the 5.3 per cent growth observed in the first quarter. It is at the worst pace in five quarters, adding pressure on  to boost confidence as top leaders start a twice-a-decade policy meeting on Monday. China's ruling Communist Party has commenced its so-called third plenum, a major meeting held roughly once every five years to map out the general direction of the country's long-term social and economic policies. Its Central Committee convened the plenary session, or plenum, the third since its members were elected during the party's last congress in 2022, to deliberate on a key policy document on deepening reforms and advancing China's modernisation.The slowdown reflected in the data — the first set of quarterly indicators free of distortions by the pandemic — could strengthen calls for Beijing to ramp up efforts to stimulate growth. They were published the same day President  was set to convene the third plenum meeting to set major economic and political policies for the coming years.China needs to “fully estimate difficulties, challenges and uncertainties in development” while strengthening confidence in the  going forward, and implement macroeconomic policies well to promote a healthy growth, the NBS said in a statement accompanying the release.The economic landscape in China has shown disparities, with industrial output surpassing domestic consumption. This has heightened deflation concerns amid a downturn in the property sector and increasing local government debt. Despite resilient Chinese exports offering some stability, escalating trade tensions now pose a significant risk.China has been experiencing a shift from high-speed growth to a more moderate pace in recent years. The  for 2023 was around 5.5 per cent, down from previous double-digit growth rates seen in earlier decades. The shift in China's  from high-speed to more moderate levels in recent years can be attributed to several interrelated factors. According to the World Bank, China has been undergoing a shift from an investment-driven growth model to one that emphasises consumption and services. Investment in infrastructure and heavy industries, which previously drove rapid expansion, has slowed as the economy matures. Moreover, China's demographic dividend, which provided a large and youthful workforce, is diminishing as the population ages. An ageing population reduces the labour force participation rate and limits the potential for rapid economic expansion. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, escalating trade tensions with the United States and other major economies have weighed on China's export sector and overall economic confidence. Tariffs and trade barriers have disrupted supply chains and reduced global demand for Chinese goods. China faces significant environmental challenges stemming from decades of rapid industrialization. Efforts to curb pollution and promote green development, while crucial for long-term sustainability, have also impacted industrial output and economic growth rates. According to the China Economic Review, the transition to a more innovation-driven economy requires time and resources, which may temporarily affect overall GDP growth rates.Since lifting more than 800 million people out of  since the late 1970s, China now lies at a crossroads where observers fear the world's second-largest economy could settle into a long period of low growth or even Japan-like deflation. The third plenum this week will help China better navigate complexities in global landscapes, advance its economic transformation, and enhance the people's ""sense of gain"", state media has cited Chinese think-tanks as saying.At the last fifth plenum in 2020, the party said it aimed to boost per capita GDP to the level seen in moderately developed nations by 2035. By that time, disparities in urban-rural development, in development between regions, and in living standards will be significantly reduced, it said. The modernisation of China's military will also be ""basically"" achieved.The third plenum will outline efforts to promote advanced manufacturing, revise the tax system to curb debt risks, manage a vast property crisis, boost domestic consumption and revitalise the private sector, policy advisers have said.Goldman Sachs on Monday lowered its forecast for China's 2024 gross domestic product to 4.9% from 5.0% on the back of data showing that the country's economy slowed in the second quarter. ""To counteract weak domestic demand, we believe more policy easing is necessary through the remainder of this year, especially on the fiscal and housing fronts,"" said Goldman Sachs economists, led by Lisheng Wang.In May, the  projected China's economic growth at 5 per cent, up from its earlier forecast of 4.6 per cent, but cautioned it of a slowdown to contract to 3.3 per cent by 2029 due to ageing and slower productivity growth and suggested to boost productivity to continue with . The 5 per cent growth revision by the IMF is in line with the target set by the Chinese government for the world's second-largest economy which is grappling with a slowdown triggered by the crippling property sector crisis and industrial overcapacity.China's property sector, the dominant component of the Chinese economy in the last few years, remained on its Achilles heel causing widespread crisis.IMF's First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said in May that achieving high-quality growth, the buzzword of President Xi Jinping, will require structural reforms to counter headwinds and address underlying imbalances. ""Key priorities include rebalancing the economy towards consumption by strengthening the social safety net and liberalising the services sector to enable it to boost growth potential and create jobs,"" she said. She also highlighted China's role in restructuring the debt owed by several smaller countries. ""The Fund looks forward to continued cooperation with the authorities in this regard,"" she said.Steve Barnett, the IMF's senior resident representative in China, said the third plenum should look to continue with economic reforms to boost productivity as it rolls out plans for the next decade. ""If we think of the third plenum as a time to look at medium- and long-term reforms, if I could pick just one [pressing issue to focus on], it's to boost productivity,"" Barnett said. ""The way to do that is to continue with economic reforms.""And this takes us to things like giving the market a decisive role in the economy - which actually featured prominently for the first time in the 2013 third party plenum - and levelling the playing field between all types of firms - state-owned firms, private firms, foreign firms,"" he said."

Today, we are witnessing GCCs in India spearheading cutting-edge R&D in AI, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing,” said Rahul Arora, Head - Office Leasing & Retail Services, Senior Managing Director (Karnataka, Kerala), India, JLL.According to him, India's GCCs have evolved from service providers to the nerve centers of global corporations, with Indian leaders shaping business strategies. This shift highlights India's rise as a hub of innovation for multinational enterprises.“Recent leasing activity further emphasizes the GCC sector's robust growth. In the last 18 months alone, GCCs leased an astounding 35.2 million sq ft of office space. Notably, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai, captured a significant three-quarters of this leasing activity, underscoring the region's appeal with its combination of world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and supportive business ecosystems,” said Samantak Das, Chief Economist and head of Research and REIS, India, JLL.Bengaluru, holding around 42% of the total space occupied by GCCs, highlights the city's tech ecosystem, educational institutions, and cosmopolitan work environment, which draw top talent from around the world.The GCC landscape in India is dominated by three key sectors: Manufacturing, IT/ITeS, and Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), which collectively represent about 78% of the occupied area.This concentration reflects India's strengths in technology, finance, and industrial expertise, as well as the country's ability to support complex, high-value operations across these domains.The outlook for India's GCC sector is promising. GCCs represent about 50% of the current office space demand across the top seven cities, indicating sustained growth and investment in the country. As these centers transition from cost-saving operations to hubs of innovation, India's influence in driving global business transformation and digital advancement is poised to increase even more.The story of rapid growth, regional concentration, and sectoral specialization illustrates that India’s GCC sector is not only expanding but also undergoing a fundamental evolution. With its abundant talent pool and robust infrastructure, India is steadily reinforcing its status as the leading global destination for GCCs, fostering innovation and advanced capabilities for multinational corporations."
173,Budget 2024: Industry leaders weigh in on India's path to growth and innovation,"The Union Budget 2024-25, presented by Finance Minister , marks a significant step towards realising the vision of a ‘’. The Union Budget focuses on fiscal consolidation with a target of a 4.9% fiscal deficit of GDP. Key allocations include substantial funding for infrastructure, rural development, employment, and skilling initiatives.

The enhanced tax deductions, increased Mudra loan limits, and concessions for MSMEs are expected to boost entrepreneurial growth. The reduction in tax for foreign companies from 40% to 35% is anticipated to attract higher FDI, creating new growth opportunities.Karan Verma, Co-Founder and Director of  emphasised the budget's dedication to economic stability and growth. He highlighted the introduction of a new ₹5,000 crore fund to support innovation and the extension of tax benefits for startups. The establishment of a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund for the space economy demonstrates a forward-looking vision, positioning India as a leader in this emerging sector. These measures are expected to provide a significant boost to the startup ecosystem, fostering innovation and long-term growth.Vijay Navaluri, Co-founder & Chief Customer Officer of Supervity, praised the budget for its strong emphasis on technology and innovation. The abolition of the Angel Tax for investors is expected to significantly enhance the startup ecosystem, fostering greater investments and innovation.

The special attention to MSMEs and initiatives to foster entrepreneurship are seen as positive steps that will benefit the startup ecosystem and the broader economy.Sajju Jain, an entrepreneur, startup coach and Harvard Business School alumnus, acknowledged the abolition of the Angel Tax as a positive move. He welcomed the allocation of Rs. 2 lakh crores for employment creation and skill development, especially through internships in top companies. However, he noted that direct support for startups in the budget remains limited, and sustained support will be necessary to build long-term capacity and capabilities.Mr. Soumya Sarkar, Co-Founder of Wealth Redefine (AMFI registered MFD), commended the government's fiscal discipline, highlighting the fiscal deficit target of 4.9% of GDP. The budget’s focus on infrastructure, rural development, employment, and skilling initiatives promises to drive economic growth and create new opportunities. The abolition of the Angel Tax for startups is seen as a crucial boost for the entrepreneurial ecosystem. However, the proposed tax hikes on short-term and long-term capital gains might dampen investor sentiment despite the simplification of capital gains taxation.Gautam Madhavan, Founder and CEO of Mad Influence, welcomed the budget's focus on economic growth and support for innovation. The emphasis on digital public infrastructure and the abolition of the Angel Tax are expected to empower digital creators and influencers, fostering a vibrant and sustainable digital economy.Arun Alagappan, Executive Chairman, Coromandel International Limited, said, “The government’s commitment to get 1 crore farmers into organic farming and promote large-scale horticulture production in the next two years will significantly increase agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Furthermore, the emphasis on strengthening the production, storage, and marketing of pulses, along with financing for shrimp farming, showcases a holistic approach to supporting diverse agricultural activities. The allocation of ₹1.52 lakh crore for agriculture and allied sectors is a clear indication of the government's dedication to transforming this critical sector,"" he said. He added that the government’s plan to implement digital crop survey for kharif crop in 400 districts as well as the release of 109 weather resistant seeds, will drive innovation and efficiency in farming practices. Priyadarshi Nanu Pany, Founder & CEO, CSM Tech, found the Budget's focus on MSMEs very nuanced on the sector's challenges and potential. ""The credit-centric measures—including the new guarantee scheme, stress-period support, and the digital footprint-based assessment model could revolutionise MSME financing. By reducing reliance on collateral and traditional metrics, these initiatives promise to unlock capital for a broader spectrum of enterprises, potentially catalysing growth and job creation. The expansion of TReDS and SIDBI's reach demonstrates a commitment to improving liquidity and financial inclusion across MSME clusters,"" he said.Overall, the Union Budget 2024-25 is seen as a forward-looking initiative aimed at boosting economic growth, fostering innovation, and improving the ease of doing business in India. The government's commitment to infrastructure, technology, and rural development, alongside fiscal discipline, sets a positive tone for India's economic trajectory in the coming years."

176,India's strategic leap: 12 new industrial parks to drive sustainable urbanisation & manufacturing growth," and manufacturing have gone hand in hand. In post-World War 2 Japan, Tokyo and Osaka became centres of . In China, Shenzhen and Guangzhou have become megacities. Urban areas often have skilled labour, crucial for industry.India has grappled with rapid and unplanned urbanisation that deviates from sustainable principles, leading to a decline in living standards. 'Viksit Bharat' hinges critically on manufacturing and urbanisation. India's goal of becoming a high-income country will require growth rates of 8%+ in the next three decades, and a sustained increase in investment to about 35% of GDP. Only then will we see our per-capita incomes go from $2,000 to $18,000.Manufacturing and infra development must lead this transition. Per-capita incomes are associated with labour productivity. To raise them, we must raise labour productivity. With close to 45% of our labour force in agriculture, with low productivity, our per-capita incomes are a fraction of those of other G20 nations. Manufacturing provides an avenue for large- scale employment, pulling labour out of agriculture. Manufacturing  stands at 3.5x that of agriculture, suggesting a significant increase in incomes if we can create enough jobs in manufacturing.For successful industrial development, it's crucial to integrate quality infra that minimises ecological impacts and promotes energy efficiency and effective waste management. These elements should not only position industrial cities as  but also ensure they contribute to  environments.In this context, GoI's recent approval of 12 new industrial parks under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP) signifies a strategic leap in addressing the pivotal philosophies of manufacturing and urbanisation. These new nodes are designed to transform India's industrial landscape and rectify short- sighted, unplanned urbanisation. With over 500 mn people expected to settle in urban cities, the timing of this initiative is crucial.Embracing this manufacturing-led urbanisation model, the emphasis on creating industrial  can make a difference for India as a manufacturing destination. By ensuring these areas are developed 'ahead of demand', GoI aims to build infra that anticipates future growth, thus avoiding pitfalls of hasty construction. The initiative's key concepts include: ➤ Walk-to-work cities where residential areas integrate seamlessly with workplaces. ➤ Plug-and-play manufacturing allowing industries to start operations swiftly, enhancing efficiencies. ➤ Locating industries alongside residential settings, these parks can foster a better quality of life, reduce carbon footprints and enhance productivity. ➤ NICDP plans to create around 1 mn direct and 3 mn indirect jobs.Emerging industrial cities act as catalysts to address urbanisation challenges directly. A prime example is Dholera Smart City, India's first smart city. Integrating manufacturing with urban planning, Dholera is strategically designed to be twice the size of Delhi and six times that of Shanghai. Its infra plans boast remarkable connectivity through rail, road, express highways, an international airport and a metro system, linking the city to national and global markets.As seen in other townships like Shendra-Bidkin (Maharashtra), Integrated Industrial Township in Greater Noida (UP), and Integrated Industrial Township at Vikram Udyogpuri, Ujjain (MP), this approach drives economic growth while aligning urban development with community needs, creating liveable cities for future generations.Despite the promise that these new industrial parks herald, the path ahead is challenging. Lessons from SEZs must inform the development of the new parks. Development of world- class, sustainable infra is imperative to India's ambitions. NICDP aligns with the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan, targeting multimodal connectivity that will enhance the movement of people, goods and services. With ready-to-allot land strategically located along six major corridors, these industrial cities will not only draw domestic investments but also facilitate significant FDI.Outcomes of this initiative extend far beyond economic statistics. If executed effectively, it can lay the foundation for a cleaner, more equitable urban future.( Originally published on Sep 05, 2024 )(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

It highlights that combining policy action, de-risking tools, and innovative financing mechanisms is the key to unlocking the $1.7 trillion needed in the Global South, demonstrating that no single actor can accomplish this alone.“Public-private partnerships and international cooperation will be key to ensuring an equitable and sustainable clean energy future for ,” said Roberto Bocca, Head of the World Economic Forum’s Centre for Energy and Materials.Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) are set to represent 90% of the growth in global energy demand by 2035 while hosting the lion's share of the global population. Yet, they account for less than one-fifth of global clean energy investments, partly due to risk profiles and regulatory environments that may not align with the preferences of many investors.“The Playbook aims to debunk some of the myths surrounding the developing world and demonstrate that innovative solutions for EMDEs by EMDEs already exist,” said Samaila Zubairu, President & CEO of the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), and Co-chair of the Network. “Strategic partnerships led by reputable institutions like the AFC are essential to bridge the clean energy investment gap in the Global South because they will accelerate the global shift to clean energy, strengthen economic resilience, and meet the urgent energy needs of emerging markets.” The Playbook also highlights four integrated national approaches with a detailed analysis of Brazil, Chile, Egypt, and India’s success stories. These analyses demonstrate how countries have raised billions in clean energy capital by deploying a comprehensive blend of strategies, including innovative policy measures and finance platforms. These include government commitments backed by attractive and stable policies, such as tax benefits and auctions; guarantees and currency hedging to alleviate investment risks; and innovative structures, such as debt swaps, to scale finance.""Country-led commitment reforms and platforms are critical to align  efforts in a way that prioritizes national objectives and accelerates progress towards a just, green transition,” said Rania A. Al-Mashat, Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation of Egypt and Co-Chair of the Network “The Network serves as an important South-South cooperation platform, whereas the Playbook provides an effective way to exchange best practices and lessons learned between peer countries, thus unlocking just financing solutions that accelerate progress towards a just ."""

Early resolution of , weakening of  accompanied by further easing of global food and commodity prices, improvement in supply conditions and proactive supply-side measures by the government could put downward pressure on inflation next fiscal, the RBI said in its latest monetary policy report.Upside risks to inflation will come from uneven distribution of rainfall, prolonged geopolitical conflicts and resultant supply disruptions, recent uptick in food and metal prices, volatility of crude oil prices and adverse weather events, the central bank said.Economic growth for fiscal ended March 2026 is expected to ease slightly to 7.1% from 7.2% in the current fiscal, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks.  Robust government capex and revival in private investment, improved prospects of agricultural sector due to favourable monsoon rainfall could provide an upside surprise to growth. The RBI also highlighted strengthening manufacturing and services sector activity sustained by strong domestic demand, among other reasons, that could aid growth.On the contrary, further escalation in geopolitical tensions, volatility in international financial markets and geoeconomic fragmentation, deceleration in global demand, frequent weather-related disturbances due to climate change and supply chain disruptions could pose downside risks to the baseline growth path, RBI said.Services price and wage inflation could keep global interest rates higher for longer, adversely impacting global growth prospects. Headwinds from prolonged geopolitical and trade tensions, supply chain disruptions and swings in economic policies resulting from impending elections in major economies could also impact global growth.""In case these downside risks materialise, and, if global growth is 100 bps lower than the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be lower than baseline projections by around 30 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively. If, however, there is faster convergence in global disinflation and alignment in monetary policy paths going forward, recovery in global trade and resolution of geopolitical tensions, there can be an upside to global growth. If global growth is higher by 50 bps, domestic growth and inflation could turn out to be higher by around 15 basis points and 7 basis points, respectively,"" RBI said. In Video:

Only ten increased spending, though marginally. The study considered cumulative spending on R&D, including capital expenses and recurring costs on research.Other prominent names in India Inc which cut R&D spending as a proportion of sales include , , , ,  and . The reduction is up to 1.7% of revenues, with total R&D spending varying between 0.06% of revenues to 3% as of FY24.""The focus on R&D in Indian companies is not as deep rooted unlike the global peers even though almost all large companies in India have set up dedicated R&D teams and, in some cases, recruited teams from overseas,"" said Ravinder Zutshi, an electronics industry expert and a former deputy managing director at Samsung Electronics India.  ""Unless they improve the spending as a percentage of revenue, it will be difficult to take on the global technology competencies of the Apples and Samsungs of the world,"" said Zutshi.To be sure, some multinational companies operating in the country tend to utilise the expertise of their parents' research and development (R&D) capabilities for localising their global products or developing new products for the Indian market.For instance,  said in its 2024 annual report that it benefits from the extensive centralised R&D activity and expenditure of the Nestle Group with an annual outlay of over CHF 1.7 billion ($2 billion).

This Rs 10,900 crore flagship scheme for promoting  under the  (MHI) aims to subsidise domestically made , trucks, ambulances, two and three wheelers.In a first initiative of its kind, the scheme will also support deployment of  powered ambulances, Union Heavy Industries Minister H D Kumaraswamy told journalists Thursday. In addition to these, the centre has notified a steep decline of sops, significantly lowering them from the second year of implementation.“The scheme aims to accelerate the adoption of  in the country and establish essential , promoting cleaner and more sustainable transportation,” Kumaraswamy said.An official statement said the scheme will support deployment of 24.79 lakh electric two-wheelers (e-2w), 3.16 lakh electric three-wheelers (e-3w), and 14,028 electric buses (). The scheme is currently valid for sales made during fiscal 2024-25 and 2025-26.These subsidies are linked to the battery capacity of an electric vehicle (EV). For sales made during fiscal 2024-25, eligible e-2w and e-3w will get a subsidy of Rs 5,000 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of battery capacity, while e-buses will get Rs 10,000 per kWh. The per unit subsidy will be halved for sales made during fiscal 2025-26.Responding to a query on how compliance with domestic manufacturing norms will be ensured in the new scheme, Secretary, Ministry of Heavy Industries, Kamran Rizvi said, “There will be a conformity of production (COP) test every six months.”PM E-DRIVE, like its predecessor Faster Adoption and Manufacture of Electric Vehicles (FAME), is aimed at subsidising locally manufactured vehicles. But the earlier iteration was marred with instances of companies selling largely imported vehicles and wrongly availing subsidies. This eventually led to the government trying to recover the already disbursed money but with limited success since some companies contested these claims.Commenting on whether companies that are yet to payback the wrongly availed subsidies will be allowed to claim sops under the new scheme, Kumaraswamy said, “Regarding defaulters who have misused the scheme, how can we encourage them?”Another significant development is the introduction of sops for those scrapping their old trucks. The scheme will promote the deployment of e-trucks through a Rs 500 crore allocation. “Incentives will be given to those who have a scrapping certificate from approved vehicles scrapping centres,” the statement added.Deployment of 70,500 electric vehicle charging stations will be incentivised through an allocation of Rs 2,000 crore. Infrastructure at testing agencies is going to get a fillip with a Rs 780 crore outlay under PM E-DRIVE.The cabinet had also approved the payment security mechanism (PSM) to aid deployment of e-buses in the country. A Rs 3,435.33 crore fund has been created for the same to deploy 38,000 e-buses by fiscal 2028-29. “This scheme will ensure timely payments to e-bus suppliers for up to 12 years from the date of deployment,” the statement said.A senior official said this PSM will come handy during instances where the states do not make payments. The centre will be allowed to recover any shortfall made good through the PSM from the defaulting state government’s account through the  (RBI)."

Another member personally vouched for the company, as juror had used the platform for claims processing.“We have three people in our company to support people with claims processing, and it’s a lot of paperwork … this is a long process and bridging the gaps in the value chain can be game changing,” said a third juror.Typically, the  includes third-party administrators who work with insurance firms for claims processing. However, there is no such interface available for hospitals and patients. ClaimBuddy, whose competitors include ClaimTherapist and BimaGarage, is focused on addressing this gap in the insurance chain.Two other contenders in the category were praised for their business idea but eventually were passed over for being in very early stages of implementation.ClaimBuddy cofounder Khet Singh Rajpurohit, a Delhi University alumnus, began his career with Urban Company, later having a stint at  PristynCare before signing up for an MBA at IIM-Bangalore. In his second year on campus, he began work on a venture aimed at solving the logjam in health insurance processing and teamed up with a former colleague, Ajit Patel, who is now his cofounder.The Gurugram-based startup, which works with more than 125 hospitals, has so far processed claims worth over Rs 180 crore from around 15,000 patients. Valued at $23 million as of April this year, its investors include Bharat Innovation Fund, Chiratae Ventures, Rebright Partners and Titan Capital.“Our business model, which focuses on assisting patients and healthcare providers with the health insurance claims process, has always been driven by a commitment to improving efficiency and accessibility in healthcare,” said cofounder Rajpurohit. “Being acknowledged by such a prestigious jury not only validates our approach but also highlights the importance of our mission in the industry,” he added.In the coming months, the company plans to test some new product offerings, and continue to partner with large hospital chains. Besides Khageshvara Aviation Technology, the other startups in the category were fuel-aggregator platform Nawgati, cleantech startup Yotuh Energy and Culture Circle, a luxury marketplace for sneakers, watches and streetwear.It develops vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft, and its technology utilises electric power, offering a cleaner and more sustainable transportation solution, tracking global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and combat climate change.Nawgati is a one-stop fuel aggregator platform focused on compliance management and congestion monitoring needs. It helps navigate pain points for B2B clients such as Indraprastha Gas, Torrent Gas and Mahanagar Gas, as well as B2C (general public and fleet operators).Culture Circle is a marketplace for luxury products that allows users to compare prices between verified sellers of authenticated sneakers, t-shirts, streetwear and watches. Besides popular brands like Jordans and Yeezys, it also offers other streetwear brands.Yotuh is a clean tech startup electrifying refrigeration systems for cold chain logistics. It aims to make cold chain transportation accessible, affordable, and sustainable to curb food loss and improve livelihoods."

The nation is bound to be outraged, and so am I,"" she wrote in an article for PTI.""The gruesome incident of rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata has left the nation shocked. I was dismayed and horrified when I came to hear of it. What is more depressing is the fact that it was not the only incident of its kind; it is part of a series of crimes against women. Even as students, doctors and citizens were protesting in Kolkata, criminals remained on the prowl elsewhere.""""The victims include even kindergarten girls. No civilised society can allow daughters and sisters to be subjected to such atrocities. The nation is bound to be outraged, and so am I. We owe it to our daughters to remove the hurdles from their path of winning the freedom from fear. Then we can collectively give a firm answer to the innocent query of those children in the next Raksha Bandhan. Let us collectively say enough is enough."" reads the statementMurmu's remarks highlight a societal mindset that deems women as ""less powerful, less capable, less intelligent,"" and she warned that this view can escalate into seeing women as mere objects.

She conveyed her horror and dismay, noting that the problem is not isolated but part of a systemic issue. ""Even as students, doctors and citizens were protesting in Kolkata, criminals remained on the prowl elsewhere. The victims include even kindergarten girls,"" Murmu said.Reflecting on her interaction with schoolchildren on Raksha Bandhan, Murmu recounted how they asked her if horrendous acts like the 2012  incident could be prevented in the future. She acknowledged that while measures have been taken since then, they have not been sufficient. ""Did we learn our lessons? As  petered out, these incidents got buried into a deep and inaccessible recess of social memory, to be recalled only when another heinous crime takes place,"" she stated.She further commented on the incremental progress women have had to fight for over the years, often against social prejudices and restrictive customs.""This is a rather deplorable mindset… This mindset sees the female as a lesser human being, less powerful, less capable, less intelligent,"" she wrote.The president identified the objectification of women as a fundamental cause of such crimes, stressing the need to change this deeply ingrained mindset.""It is ingrained deeply in the minds of such people. It is the objectification of women by a few that is behind the crimes against women,"" the president said, reaffirming the need for both the State and society to tackle this issue.Murmu appreciated the efforts of laws and social campaigns aimed at addressing these issues but emphasized that more needs to be done.""Yet, there is something that continues to come in the way and to torment us,"" she noted.Pointing to history's lessons, Murmu urged society to confront rather than ignore these issues. She advocated for honest self-introspection to understand and rectify past errors.""Now the time has come not only to face history squarely but also to search within our souls and probe the pathology of crimes against women,"" she urged.In her closing remarks, Murmu called for a comprehensive approach to curb the issue from its roots while honoring the memory of victims to cultivate vigilance and responsibility.""Let us deal with this perversion in a comprehensive manner so as to curb it right at the beginning. We can do this only if we honour the memory of the victims by cultivating a social culture of remembering them to remind us of our failures in the past and prepare us to be more vigilant in future,"" Murmu said.""Where have we erred? And what can we do to remove the errors? Without finding out the answer to that question, the half of our population cannot live as freely as the other half,"" she concluded.Murmu's statements underscore a critical need for societal change to ensure the safety and equality of women in India, calling for both societal and governmental action.( Originally published on Aug 28, 2024 )In Video:

Additionally, the daily average property registrations rate increased to 578 units this Navratri from 510 units in last year's Navratri.""The festive season sparked renewed sales momentum, leading to a sharp rise in property registrations. September 2024 saw lower volumes as homebuyers typically avoid making major purchases during the Shraddh period. However, Navratri brought a shift in sentiment, with stable interest rates and growing demand for premium properties driving the increase,"" said Shishir Baijal, CMD, .As the festive season continues into Diwali, he expects the registration volumes to stay strong, supported by steady sales, gradually increasing property prices, and stable interest rates.""The sales activity in September was impacted due to the 15-day Shraadh period, which is considered to be inauspicious for new deals and ventures.

197,"Brookings report backs PM Modi's policy thrust, says it helped eliminate extreme poverty"," has achieved a significant milestone in its fight against poverty, according to a commentary authored by economists Surjit Bhalla and Karan Bhasin from The  Institution. Citing recently released  expenditure data for 2022-23, the economists highlighted a sharp decline in extreme  across the country.The data revealed that real per capita consumption in India has been growing at a rate of 2.9 per cent annually since 2011-12. Notably, rural areas have seen a higher growth rate of 3.1 per cent compared to urban areas at 2.6 per cent.Furthermore, there has been an unprecedented reduction in both urban and rural inequality, as indicated by the decline in the Gini coefficient. The urban Gini decreased from 36.7 to 31.9, while the rural Gini dropped from 28.7 to 27.0.""In the annals of inequality analysis, this decline is unheard of, and especially in the context of high per capita growth,"" the economists emphasized.The combination of robust economic growth and a substantial decrease in inequality has led to the eradication of extreme poverty in India, as per the report. This assertion was supported by the Headcount Poverty Ratio (HCR), which has declined from 12.2 per cent in 2011-12 to a mere 2 per cent in 2022-23, equivalent to an annual decrease of 0.93 percentage points.Rural poverty now stands at 2.5 per cent, while urban poverty has reduced to 1 per cent. The authors stated that these estimates do not account for the government's provision of free food to a significant portion of the population, nor do they consider the utilization of public health and education services.The pace of poverty reduction in India is remarkable, with the country witnessing a decline that previously took three decades to achieve, now realized over just 11 years.""The relatively higher consumption growth in rural areas should not come as a surprise given the strong  on redistribution through a wide variety of publicly funded programs. These include a national mission for construction of toilets and attempts to ensure universal access to electricity, modern cooking fuel, and more recently, piped water,"" the report said. Given the near elimination of extreme poverty, India should now graduate to a higher poverty line, which would provide an opportunity to redefine existing social protection programmes to give greater support to the genuinely poor, it added. ""Official data now confirms that India has eliminated extreme poverty as commonly defined in international comparisons,"" the economists said. This is an encouraging development with positive implications for global poverty headcount rates. This also means that the time has come for India to graduate to a higher poverty line much like other countries. The transition to a higher poverty line provides an opportunity to redefine existing social protection programmes, particularly with the objective of better identification of intended beneficiaries and providing greater support to the genuine poor, it added.A latest consumer expenditure survey indicated that poverty has come down to five per cent in the country and people are becoming prosperous both in rural and urban areas, NITI Aayog CEO B V R Subrahmanyam said. The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, released data on household consumption expenditure for the year 2022-23 which showed per capita monthly household expenditure more than doubled in 2022-23 as compared to 2011-12.""This long-awaited consumer expenditure survey has brought out many things. With data on household consumption, we can assess what is the status of poverty in the country and how successful the poverty alleviation measures have been,"" PTI quoted Subrahmanyam as saying. ""The survey findings indicate that poverty in India is below five per cent now. I am convinced with the data,"" he added.He said that for the purpose of the survey, people were kept in 20 different categories and the data showed that the average per capita monthly expenditure for all categories stood at Rs 3,773 in rural areas and Rs 6,459 in urban areas. The average per capita monthly expenditure of 0-5 per cent fractile class is pegged at Rs 1,373 in rural areas and Rs 2,001 in urban areas.""If we take the poverty line and inflate it with the  (CPI) to today's rate, we see that the average consumption of the lowest fractional, the 0-5 per cent, is about the same. This means poverty in the country is there in the 0-5 per cent group only,"" the NITI Aayog CEO said.""This is my assessment. But economists will analyse it and come out with absolutely correct numbers,"" he added.Citing the survey data, Subrahmanyam said the increase in consumption both in rural and urban areas is about 2.5 times.""This shows that the progress in the country is happening in both urban and rural areas,"" he added.The survey data highlighted that the consumption in rural areas is growing faster than in urban areas, thereby narrowing the gap, Subrahmanyam said, adding, ""Disparities are coming down.""It said that the gap was 84 per cent in 2011-12 and has come down to 71 per cent in 2022-23. The gap was at its peak of 91 per cent in 2004-05.The NITI Aayog CEO had said that if the trend continues, it is possible that urban and rural incomes and consumption will be the same in the coming years, Subrahmanyam said.The NSSO survey indicated a significant fall in the consumption of cereals and food in the country. In rural areas, consumption of cereals as a share in the average MPCE (Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure) has gone down from 22 per cent in 1999-2000 and 10.7 per cent in 2011-12 to less than five per cent now.The total consumption of food in rural areas as a share in the average MPCE has gone down from almost 60 per cent in 1999-2000 and 53 per cent in 2011-12 to 46 per cent now, according to the survey.Consumption of cereals and food in urban areas as a share has gone down from 12 per cent in 1999-2000 and over six per cent in 2011-12 to less than four per cent now, while the total consumption of food in urban areas as a share in the average MPCE has gone down to 39 per cent for the first time ever from almost 50 per cent in 1999-2000 and 43 per cent in 2011-12.""This means people are becoming prosperous with extra income. And with this increased prosperity, they are spending more on other things than food. And in food, you will see they are drinking more milk, eating fruits and more vegetables. And the most significant is that they are spending more on processed food,"" he said.Subrahmanyam said after the NSSO survey, the consumer price index will have to be rebalanced to represent current consumption patterns.""The contribution of food to CPI  will be lower and probably was lower in earlier years also. This means inflation was being overstated and is probably less as food has been a major contributor to inflation,"" he said, adding that the NSSO survey may have implications on GDP."

In 2022, only three cases of child marriage were registered per day, yet in most instances, the groom was over 21.This alarming statistic comes from a study by the , part of the Child Marriage Free India network. The report analyzed data from Census 2011,  (NCRB), and National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5, 2019-21).According to the report, NCRB data from 2018-2022 recorded 3,863 child marriages. However, extrapolating from Census estimates, around 16 lakh child marriages occur annually, translating to over 4,000 per day. NFHS-5 estimates show that 23.3% of women aged 20-24 were married before turning 18.The northeastern state of Assam, where child marriage is rampant, has made significant strides in curbing the practice. The report highlights an 81% drop in child marriages between 2021-22 and 2023-24 across 1,132 villages in 20 districts. The number of cases fell from 3,225 in 2021-22 to 627 in 2023-24, with over 3,000 arrests made last year. A survey in these villages revealed that 98% of respondents attributed the decline to the state's strict .Child marriage has been banned in India since 1929, with several amendments made to the Act over the years. However, the practice has persisted despite evidence that ending child marriage can improve maternal and infant mortality rates, female labor force participation, and . The report also notes prolonged trials and poor conviction rates as factors encouraging child marriages. ""In 2022, out of the total 3,563 child marriage cases listed for trial in courts under the , a mere 181 cases were successfully concluded in terms of trial completion,"" the report stated. The case pendency rate stands at 92%, with a conviction rate of just 11%.NGOs preventing child marriages indicate that most cases involve exploiting the vulnerability of girls, with older men taking advantage of their position of authority."
201,Making India an AI first nation — from classrooms to boardrooms,"With one of the youngest populations in the world and a thrust on ,  has a unique human capital advantage to harness artificial intelligence for significant economic and societal benefits. Empowering people with AI  will be a foundational step in India becoming an AI-first nation.Demand for  skills is far outstripping talent supply, placing India in a unique position to leverage its demographic advantage. AI skills have emerged as one of the key considerations for jobs globally, as organisations look to scale their businesses with AI.Given gen AI’s universal applicability, organisations across industries will have to build a robust and inclusive talent pipeline with future-ready skills to unlock productivity, efficiency and  to stay competitive.Earlier this year, the global population exceeded eight billion people. Today, one out of every six people on earth live in India. AI is key to India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), and every day, the question remains: How and what should be done to put AI in the hands of everyone?As technology changes, the work to govern AI responsibly must keep pace. Aligned with the ‘India AI Mission’ and ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’, public and private sector will need to come together to democratise access to AI skills. We need to adopt a skilling-first approach to AI to ensure our citizens can participate and thrive in an AI economy.This requires a three-tiered approach in building skills from classrooms to boardrooms: 1) Building AI skills at the ; 2) Enhancing AI fluency in government; and 3) Empowering organisations with a future-ready workforce. AI skilling can help transform India’s global competitiveness and turbocharge our growth and development.Empowering communities at the grassroots with AI fluency can spark innovation at scale, enabling people to benefit from AI’s advances. Non-profits, in collaboration with industry and government stakeholders, can play a major role in driving AI fluency at the grassroots. They can provide AI skilling resources and technologies, support with funds and technical assistance for building and scaling programs that drive social impact.A non-profit organisation SEEDS is leveraging gen AI to help vulnerable people in slums understand the dangers of heat waves and protect themselves. Sunny Lives, the AI model that helped generate heat wave risk information for around 125,000 people, has seen many of the at-risk people come up with innovative home-grown solutions to reduce heat impact, reinforcing how AI skills are helping unlock human ingenuity and improve lives.Agriculture is another important case. Farmers face challenges like unpredictable weather conditions, uncontrollable pests and diseases, loss of yield, soil degradation and limited connectivity with buyers/sellers. We need solutions that facilitate data collection from satellites, weather providers and sensors. Farmvibes.AI, for instance, leverages AI to provide valuable insights for farmers on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH and other parameters. Additionally, Agripilot.ai provides farmers with actionable insights for growing food more sustainably. These innovations empower farmers with data-driven tools to enhance productivity and sustainability in agriculture.Organizations and industry can play an enabling role in seeding the next generation of AI innovators by collaborating with education institutions to train students in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. By imparting skills to increase representation of women in AI, cloud and cybersecurity, the industry can play an enabling role in building a diverse and inclusive talent pool.From developing AI solutions for multilingual communication barriers to enhancing agricultural productivity through data-driven insights, strategic investments in human capital can yield substantial dividends for development."
